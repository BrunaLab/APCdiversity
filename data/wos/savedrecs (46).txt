DE da Vinci surgery; Odontoid; Robotic; Transoral robotic surgery
ID ASSISTED TRANSORAL ODONTOIDECTOMY; SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Transoral robotic surgery has been used successfully to assist many surgical procedures. Here, we report its first use as pure robotic surgery, applied to excise an odontoid metastatic mass.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old woman was hospitalized due to a lesion consistent with metastasis that extended to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles and that had completely destroyed the odontoid bone. Occipitocervical fixation was performed initially, and transoral surgery took place 5 days later. The da Vinci Surgical System Robot was used to resect the tumor. The patient was discharged with a very good general condition.
   CONCLUSIONS: This article presents the first pure robotic surgery for odontoid. The increasing number of robot-assisted cases will demonstrate the necessity of this evolution in neurosurgery and should accelerate the process.

TI An Infratemporal Dermoid Cyst That Expanded the Foramen Ovale: A Case
   Report
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Dermoid cyst; Infratemporal fossa; Skull base
ID OF-THE-LITERATURE; FOSSA
AB BACKGROUND: Dermoid cysts are rare tumors usually seen in the midline structure of the brain but rarely arise in the petrous apex and cavernous sinus. There have been very few reports of dermoid cysts arising in the infratemporal fossa, with scarce anatomic descriptions. Here we report the case of a patient with a dermoid cyst in the left infratemporal fossa.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 43-year-old female with complaints of nonspecific headaches. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a cystic lesion measuring 25 x 18 x 15 mm in the left infratemporal fossa that had expanded the foramen ovale. The same lesion was observed as a high-intensity area on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with fat saturation. Diffusion-weighted MRI showed no restriction, unlike in cases of epidermoid cysts. A left fronto-temporo-sphenoidal craniotomy with a detachment of the zygoma was performed to approach the lesion. The tumor wall was continuously attached to the dura, although the tumor itself was entirely extradural in location. The V3 branch of the trigeminal nerve was firmly attached around the tumor. The tumor was cystic, and it shrunk after the fatty yellowish contents were suctioned. Complete resection was achieved without complications. A pathological analysis enabled the diagnosis of a dermoid cyst. No tumor recurrences or associated complications were observed at the 1-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dermoid cysts in the infratemporal fossa are extremely rare. However, tumor resections can be performed safely and efficaciously using anatomically detailed preoperative planning.

AB BACKGROUND: Collision tumors are often difficult to distinguish from intratumoral heterogeneity in diffuse gliomas.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: We report the case of a 44-year-old woman admitted for intracranial hypertension. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right intra-axial frontal mass, composed of a hypervascular nodular portion contrasting with a large nonenhanced infiltrative and muliticystic portion. Histopathologic examination showed the occurrence of two morphologically different gliomas. The largest component corresponded to an anaplastic astrocytoma, IDH1-mutated. The second corresponded to a leptomeningeal nodule, reminiscent of a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. Both tumoral components exhibited anaplastic features, World Health Organization grade III. Immunohistochemical and molecular studies showed that the 2 components were identical, IDH1 R132H mutated but without BRAF V600E mutation. Tumor progression was assessed 2 years after surgery, after radiotherapy and chemotherapy, showing supratentorial leptomeningeal dissemination.
   CONCLUSIONS: Collision tumors and combined neoplasms have been rarely described in the brain and only 4 similar articles report the synchronous occurrence of 2 primary gliomas. A review of the literature is proposed, focusing on criteria that could be used to discriminate them.

   HEAD-INJURY; MANAGEMENT; VASOSPASM; PRESSURE; TRIAL
AB BACKGROUND: The available surgical options to control increased intracranial pressure and to limit secondary brain damage in the setting of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) include decompressive craniectomy, cisternostomy, and other methods to divert cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) such as placement of an external ventricular drain.
   METHODS: We discuss the rationale and the limitations of these surgical techniques based on preclinical and clinical evidence. A detailed description of the differences between ventricular CSF drainage and cisternal drainage is added based on recent hypotheses on TBI physiopathology and CSF circulation.
   RESULTS: Cisternostomy seems a more physiological approach to the treatment of brain swelling, with the potential of effectively controlling intracranial pressure and reducing the effects of secondary brain damage.
   CONCLUSIONS: Further clinical studies need to be performed to validate the efficacy of this emerging surgical procedure for severe TBI.

   MANIFESTATION; DIAGNOSIS; FEATURES; PATIENT; LESIONS; CT
AB BACKGROUND: Neoplasms located in the Meckel cave account for 0.2% -0.5% of all intracranial tumors. This area is the site of many types of pathologic lesions, most often trigeminal nerve schwannomas and meningiomas. Melanin-containing tumors are rare in this area. These tumor types can be suspected if the magnetic resonance characteristics of a tumor has some differences in comparison with other types of central nervous system neoplasms. In fact, differential diagnosis of melanotic tumors is based mainly on the histopathologic criteria and immunohistochemical profile. This article presents a case report of melanotic schwannoma of the Meckel cave and a literature review of the problem.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 23-year-old man underwent a 2-stage surgery for a dumbbell pigmented mass lesion located in the Meckel cave. No signs of recurrence were seen on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 3.5 years after the operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Melanin-containing tumor can be suspected in the presence of radiologic characteristics, such as a hyperintense MRI signal on T1-weighted images and a hypointense signal on T2-weighted images. If a black extracerebral tumor is detected, the main course of surgical treatment is maximal excision despite it possibly being a malignant melanoma and the temptation to perform partial resection because of an unfavorable prognosis. Chemotherapy can be justified in the presence of an aggressive melanotic schwannoma.

   (MEC); Parotid
ID GLAND; MULTIFORME
AB BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary malignant tumor of the brain and central nervous system. Extracranial metastases of GBM are rare, with few case reports published to date. The tumor cells of GBM show strong immunopositivity for glial fibrillary acid protein.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 47-year-old man without comorbidities presented with a 1-year history of an augmenting right parotid lump. A right total parotidectomy with selective neck dissection was performed. The hematoxyline eosin-stained slice of a parotid lymph node collected intraoperatively revealed destruction of normal lymph node structure by medium-sized pleomorphic cells scattered in groups; their cytoplasm was lightly stained and pale. There were abundant myxoid stroma in the interstitial tissue. This characteristic mimicked mucoepidermoid carcinoma. An immunohistochemistry test demonstrated that the tumor cells were positive for glial fibrillary acid protein. A diagnosis of extracranial metastasis of GBM was made after confirmation with postoperative pathologic examination and the review of the intracranial resection specimen.
   CONCLUSIONS: We believe that this is the first reported case of extracranial metastasis of GBM resembling mucoepidermoid carcinoma in the microscope features. Pathologists and clinicians should be alert to this rare lesion and consider this differential diagnosis after excluding other common parotid lesions.

ID SPINE
AB OBJECTIVES: Cervical kyphosis surgery poses a significant challenge to spine surgeons. Etiologies of cervical kyphosis are many, each having its own outcome and treatment challenges. Irrespective of the etiology, the treating physician should consider all options fully to improve function and prevent neurologic worsening. We outline management principles and decision making in the case of a rigid, rounded kyphosis of the cervical spine and highlight the technique of an internal gibbectomy procedure, which has never been reported in the cervical spine.
   METHODS: We report a case of Ewing sarcoma of the cervical spine that presented with progressive myelopathy symptoms. The patient was operated on multiple times (anterior and posterior) and presented to us with rigid, rounded global kyphosis of the cervical spine. We performed internal gibbectomy from a posterior approach and decompressed the neural tissue.
   RESULTS: The patient had a satisfactory recovery in myelopathy symptoms, and the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score improved at subsequent followups. There was no recurrence at 2-year follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: Internal gibbectomy can be a treatment option in rigid, rounded kyphosis in which the primary goal of surgery is neural decompression.

AB BACKGROUND: Sacral tumors present a significant challenge to the spine surgeon. As new techniques have evolved in recent years, these lesions have become more amenable to aggressive surgical treatment. Although sacral tumors make up only a small minority of spinal tumors, their surgical management warrants special consideration.
   METHODS: Based on our experience, we highlight 3 important surgical nuances specifically for the treatment of sacral tumors: preservation and maximization of neurologic function, protection of ventral abdominal and pelvic structures, and lumbopelvic fixation.
   RESULTS: Two cases of patients with sacral tumors treated at our institution are presented to illustrate these points. Both patients had successful postoperative courses, and remained pain free, well-fixated, and neurologically intact at 3-4 month follow-up. They had no evidence of biomechanical instability.
   CONCLUSIONS: To ensure a successful outcome, a goal-directed, methodical approach is required.

AB Established in 1987, the Spine Surgery Hospital at Honghui Hospital is one of the oldest spinal surgical departments in China. The first chairman, Yuan Fuyong, devoted himself to the development of the department. The current president, Hao Dingjun, assumed the position in November 2008. The current department consists of 5 wards and 235 beds, encompassing the entire spectrum of spinal surgical diseases, with 27 specialized faculty members and care teams. The remarkable growth of the hospital during the last 30 years made it possible to perform 8000 operations in 2017. A total of 300 articles were published in scientific journals, of which more than 100 were published in international journals between 1987 and 2017. At present, the developmental model of neurosurgery and spine surgery at Honghui Hospital is based on the concept of holistic integrative medicine. It was jointly developed by several departments including those of spine surgery, neurosurgery, traditional Chinese medicine rehabilitation, and basic research. This article traces the history, research and teaching accomplishments, academic exchanges, and future directions.

He denied any history of trauma, had no family history of bleeding diathesis, and was not on anticoagulation therapy. Hematologic investigations, liver function tests, and coagulation profile all were within reference range, and preoperative craniocerebral computed tomography was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a massive compression hematoma located in the spinal canal at C2-5 level in the sagittal view and a semicircular compression hematoma in the axial view. At 1 week after C2-5 level laminectomy and evacuation of the hematoma, the patient's motor power in the left arm and left leg was improved (grades 4/5 and 5/5, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: SDH represents an emergency that could lead to significant neurologic deficit and warrants great concern. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best imaging method to diagnose this disease.

AB BACKGROUND: Although clipping and coiling of intracranial aneurysms are effective treatment options, they each have limitations. With the advent of the hybrid operating room, combined clipping and coiling for complex aneurysms in one stage becomes feasible. We report a successful case of a left posterior communicating artery aneurysm where combined clipping and endovascular treatment were applied.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 57-year-old man had been complaining of severe headache for 10 days. The computed tomography scan from a previous hospital revealed a parasellar lesion, and the computed tomography angiography in our hospital showed a 16-mm posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Clipping of the aneurysm was scheduled in our hybrid operating room, which enabled intervention of intraoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA). However, once the aneurysm was clipped, intraoperative DSA revealed that the aneurysm was remnant. We readjusted the clip and reran DSA, but the residual neck was still present. In an effort to preserve the parent artery and perforators, we decided to perform endovascular treatment. Coiling was achieved, followed by angiography, indicating that the aneurysm was almost eliminated. Overall, the patient underwent 4 angiographic explorations during surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: Combined open surgical and endovascular approaches to treat complex cerebral aneurysms in an hybrid operating room could offer an alternative when the aneurysms appear unclipped or remnant intraoperatively. In our experience, simultaneous clipping and coiling is a safe and effective procedure for efficient treatment of aneurysms.

AB BACKGROUND: Symptomatic sacral Tarlov cysts have been associated with perineal or sacral pain, radiculopathy, and urinary dysfunction. The ideal treatment of symptomatic sacral Tarlov cysts remains a matter of discussion. Various open surgical procedures have been proposed, varying from placement of shunts and clipping to laminectomy and fenestration; however, those procedures are often associated with recurrence, cerebrospinal fluid leakage, infection, and other complications. A percutaneous endoscopic surgical procedure to address this problem has not been described to date.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 21-year-old man presented with perineal and left lower extremity pain. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a sacral Tarlov cyst protruding through the left S2 canal. Through a small laminectomy at S2, the posterolateral wall of the cyst was exposed. The incision was continued from the neck to caudal of the cyst. The cyst wall was resected step by step. The fenestration was performed at the neck of the cyst with scissors. His lower extremity and perineal pain improved progressively during the first day post-operatively, and there were no signs of cerebrospinal fluid leakage, infection, or other complications. No further cyst formation or complications were recorded after 6 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this case report, we describe a percutaneous endoscopic approach to surgical resection of a Tarlov cyst that was performed safely and effectively. This novel minimally invasive strategy may have broad prospects for symptomatic sacral Tarlov cysts; however, due to the limitations of a single case, more reported cases and further controlled studies of this novel technique are needed.

TI Review of Treatment of Gunshot Wounds to Head in Late 19th Century
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Review
DE Civil war; Gunshot wounds; Head injury; Surgery
ID AMERICAN-CIVIL-WAR; INJURIES; HISTORY
AB INTRODUCTION: During the late 19th century, the seeds of modern neurosurgery were planted to bloom into what it is now known. Wars such as the American Civil War and Crimean War drove the need to find better ways of preventing mortality from gunshot wounds to the head. However, the mortality rate from all major surgical procedures to the head, neck, and face remained staggering. Herein, we describe the surgical treatments for head and neck injuries in order to improve our understanding of neurosurgical procedures performed during the late 19th century.
   METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Books for available articles pertaining to treatment for gunshot wounds to the head during the 19th century. Search terms included "Gunshot wounds, Treatment, Civil War," "Gunshot wound, Treatment 19th century," and "Gunshot wounds, Treatment, 1800s." Literature was excluded if not in English or if no translation was provided. Most of the information was taken from the International Encyclopedia of Surgery Volume II.
   RESULTS: Surgical care for gunshot wounds to the cranium were based on depth and involved finding the bullet, controlling the bleeding, and preventing further brain injury. Surgical treatment for a gunshot wound to the face or neck involved controlling the bleeding, with a focus on maintaining the airway.
   CONCLUSIONS: Because of improved understanding of infectious processes and technologic advances in surgical equipment, the late 19th century was a major milestone in creating modern day neurosurgery. The methodology behind today's treatments is no different from that of the late 19th century.

AB BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the more frequent pathologic entities in daily neurosurgical practice. Historically, CSDH was considered progressive recurrent bleeding with a traumatic cause. However, recent evidence has suggested a complex intertwined pathway of inflammation, angiogenesis, local coagulopathy, recurrent microbleeds, and exudates. The aim of the present review is to collect existing data on pathophysiology of CSDH to direct further research questions aiming to optimize treatment for the individual patient.
   METHODS: We performed a thorough literature search in PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Google scholar, focusing on any aspect of the pathophysiology and nonsurgical treatment of CSDH.
   RESULTS: After a (minor) traumatic event, the dural border cell layer tears, which leads to the extravasation of cerebrospinal fluid and blood in the subdural space. A cascade of inflammation, impaired coagulation, fibrinolysis, and angiogenesis is set in motion. The most commonly used treatment is surgical drainage. However, because of the pathophysiologic mechanisms, the mortality and high morbidity associated with surgical drainage, drug therapy (dexamethasone, atorvastatin, tranexamic acid, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) might be a beneficial alternative in many patients with CSDH.
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on pathophysiologic mechanisms, animal experiments, and small patient studies, medical treatment may play a role in the treatment of CSDH. There is a lack of level I evidence in the nonsurgical treatment of CSDH. Therefore, randomized controlled trials, currently lacking, are needed to assess which treatment is most effective in each individual patient.

ID OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Several studies have compared the clinical efficacy of percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy for L5-S1 lumbar disc herniation (LDH) using a transforaminal approach with an interlaminar approach, but with contradictory results. The aim of this study was to explore the comparison of efficacy and safety between percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy (PETD) and percutaneous endoscopic interlaminar discectomy (PEID) for L5-S1 LDH.
   METHODS: Six common databases were comprehensively searched, and relevant studies were included into the analysis when they met all the inclusion criteria.
   RESULTS: Nine studies involving 621 patients were included into the study. The results indicated that PETD was significantly associated with greater fluoroscopy times (mean difference [MD], 9.28 times; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.84-11.71; P < 0.01) and longer operative time (MD, 16.51 minutes; 95% CI, 4.01-29.02; P=0.01) compared with PEID. However, there were no distinct differences between PETD and PEID in estimated blood loss (P=0.24), bed time after surgery (P=0.32), hospitalization time (P=0.27), or MacNab evaluation (P=0.78). Similarly, no obvious differences were detected between PETD and PEID regarding Visual Analogue Scale score, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, or Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) when measured preoperatively, 1 day postoperatively, 3 months postoperatively, or at the last follow up. In addition, no significant difference was found regarding overall incidence of complications between PETD and PEID (P=0.14). Nevertheless, a significantly lower incidence rate of dural tear was observed in PETD compared with PEID (P=0.04).
   CONCLUSIONS: PETD had comparable clinical efficacy and safety compared with PEID; however, PEID was superior to PETD regarding fluoroscopy times and operative time. Therefore, PEID might be a better surgical procedure for L5S1 LDH.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the recent literature on psychologic comorbidities prevalent in youth living with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS)-including body image, eating behaviors, and mood disorders-to improve patient outcomes.
   METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed using the PubMed database. Eligible studies were extracted based on defined inclusion criteria, and the effects of AIS on psychologic comorbidities were evaluated. Studies were categorized and analyzed based on 3 recurrent themes: body image, eating behaviors, and mood.
   RESULTS: Body image presents the most important link between psychosocial difficulties and AIS. Self-reported body image is a significant factor for successful treatment outcomes in AIS. As such, specific patient-reported outcome measures have recently been developed and validated to aid in the treatment of AIS. Although patients with AIS consistently demonstrate altered anthropometry compared with their healthy counterparts, links between these factors and pathologic behaviors, such as abnormal fear of gaining weight or disordered eating, are not clear. Equally unclear is the association between AIS and altered moods, notably depression and anxiety, because of the wide variety of disparate instruments used to measure mood disorders in patients with AIS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIS undergoing treatment often face psychosocial difficulties. Together, the current literature points to a growing understanding and appreciation of the psychosocial aspects of AIS, but a clear need for more study is needed to optimize treatment of these patients.

TI Outcome of Carotid Artery Endarterectomy in Statin Users versus
   Statin-Naive Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

AB BACKGROUND: Carotid artery endarterectomy (CEA) remains the most common surgical intervention for the treatment of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. Several studies have shown a lower risk of periprocedural adverse events in statin users who undergo coronary interventions or carotid artery stenting. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine whether the use of statins is beneficial in patients undergoing CEA.
   METHODS: This study was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Eligible studies were identified through a search of PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane until August 2017. A random effects model meta-analysis was conducted and the I-2 statistic was used to assess for heterogeneity.
   RESULTS: Six studies and 7053 patients overall were included. Thirty days after CEA, 157 (2.2%) patients had a stroke (1.4% in the statin-user group vs. 3% in the statin-naive group). Despite the difference in the absolute rate of stroke, there was no statistically significant difference in the 30-day stroke rate (odds ratio [OR] 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-1.09; I-2 = 75.6%). Overall, 141 (2%) patients suffered 30-day myocardial infarction, with no significant difference between the 2 groups (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.26-2.24; I-2 = 77%). Patients who received statins before CEA were at a significantly lower risk for 30-day death (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.10-0.61; I-2 = 17.7%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Statin users undergoing CEA were at a significantly lower risk for periprocedural death compared with statin-naive patients. Despite an absolute difference in the stroke rate, the current meta-analysis did not detect a statistically significant difference in the 30-day stroke rate between statin-user and statin-naive patients undergoing CEA.

AB BACKGROUND: The incidence of 2 distinct tumor types occupying the same anatomic location is rarely observed and may be accounted for by 2 separate mechanisms: tumor-to-tumor metastasis and collision tumors, where 2 adjacent tumors invade one another. These rare phenomena arise from distinct mechanisms, which may affect their preoperative recognition, surgical approach, and postoperative care. We review 2 cases, highlighting their identification and perioperative management.
   CASE DESCRIPTIONS: In case 1, a 71-year-old patient with a history of sphenoid wing meningioma presented with headache, nausea, and vomiting and was found to have a mass with meningioma and glioblastoma (GBM) characteristics. In case 2, a 61-year-old man with worsening dysmetria in the setting of unintentional weight loss presented with multiple masses in the pelvis, abdomen, lung, and brain. The brain masses were classified as meningioma with intratumoral metastatic adenocarcinoma foci.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative recognition of collision tumor and tumor-to-tumor metastasis is imperative for surgical planning, including selecting regions for tissue biopsy and goals of care. Meticulous evaluation of history and imaging and thorough pathologic analysis allow for effective diagnosis and optimal patient outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND: We report the case of a patient with anaplastic astrocytoma whose 2 recurrent lesions showed different imaging responses from one another after bevacizumab treatment. Histologic and genetic features of this patient are also described.
   CASE DESCRIPTION: A 31-year-old patient with left temporal anaplastic astrocytoma had surgery, local radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Recurrent lesions appeared in the cerebellar vermis and left cerebellar hemisphere, and the patient was started on biweekly bevacizumab. Subsequently, the 2 enhanced lesions showed different response patterns on magnetic resonance imaging. Although the lesion in the cerebellar vermis showed an enlargement of enhancing mass, the lesion in the left cerebellar hemisphere showed disappearance of enhancement. We resected the cerebellar vermis lesion and performed biopsy on the cerebellar hemisphere lesion. The specimens were investigated. Both recurrent lesions showed higher Ki-67 labeling indices and pericyte proliferation, and less angiogenesis compared with the initial specimen. Transmission electron microscopy showed a reduction in the distance between the endothelial cells and tumor cells in both recurrent lesions, compared with the initial lesion. However, the tight junctions in the vermian lesion were still disrupted compared with the initial lesion and the cerebellar hemispheric lesion. Genetic analysis of the initial specimen showed proneural signature; however, the recurrent vermian lesion exhibited decreased expression of proneural markers.
   CONCLUSIONS: We report a case of anaplastic astrocytoma with 2 different imaging responses to bevacizumab. Our analysis suggests that differences in tight junctions possibly contributed to the changes on magnetic resonance imaging observed after bevacizumab treatment.

AB Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor, with more than10,000 new cases each year in the United States. Significant basic science and clinical research has been devoted to understanding this disease, yet median survival with standard of care treatment remains approximately 15 months. Over the past decade, advances in genomic sequencing technology, biostatistics, and computing have allowed for an unprecedented ability to profile the gene expression patterns and mutations driving the formation of tumors. These advances have generated both prognostic information as well as a multitude of treatment targets that are just now coming into clinical practice. This article aims to provide a comprehensive update on the recent use of genetic profiling to identify the molecular pathways altered in glioblastoma and to describe ongoing clinical trials to exploit these pathways for treatment.

AB Glioblastoma is one of the most lethal human cancers, with poor survival despite surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy. Advances in the treatment of this type of brain tumor are limited because of several resistance mechanisms. Such mechanisms involve limited drug entry into the central nervous system compartment by the bloode brain barrier and by actions of the normal brain to counteract tumor-targeting medications. In addition, the vast heterogeneity in glioblastoma contributes to significant therapeutic resistance by preventing adequate control of the entire tumor mass by a single drug and by facilitating escape mechanisms from targeted agents. The stem celle like characteristics of glioblastoma promote resistance to chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy through upregulation of efflux transporters, promotion of glioblastoma stem cell proliferation in neurogenic zones, and immune suppression, respectively. Metabolic cascades in glioblastoma prevent effective treatments through the optimization of glucose use, the use of alternative nutrient precursors for energy production, and the induction of hypoxia to enhance tumor growth. In the era of precision medicine, an assortment of molecular techniques is being developed to target an individual's unique tumor, with the hope that this personalized strategy will bypass therapeutic resistance. Although each resistance mechanism presents an array of challenges to effective treatment of glioblastoma, as the field recognizes and addresses these difficulties, future treatments may have more efficacy and promise for patients with glioblastoma.

AB Glioblastoma evades conventional therapies through a variety of mechanisms, including suppression of the immune system. This immunosuppressive microenvironment provides a potential target for treatment. There are several immunotherapies being actively investigated, including inhibition of immune checkpoint regulators, development of antitumor vaccinations from both dendritic cell and tumor peptide components, adoptive transfer of supercharged and durable T lymphocytes, and generation of oncolytic viruses. Although immunotherapy has already demonstrated efficacy for a variety of other malignancies, its efficacy in glioblastoma is still unclear. Identifying predictive biomarkers and improving the management of immune-related adverse effects will help to realize the full potential of these therapies.

AB Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of gross total resection in improving patient survival in glioblastoma (GBM). Advances in surgical tools and techniques such as intra-operative imaging, fluorescent agents, and functional imaging sequences are allowing for better identification of tumor borders and vital eloquent cortex in order to safely achieve higher rates of complete resections. Furthermore, due to the limits of surgical resection alone, new minimally invasive techniques for treatment of GBM are under development. These advances are crucial for improving neurosurgical care and outcomes in this difficult patient population.

AB BACKGROUND: The anterior transpetrosal (ATP) approach is the most appropriate approach for petroclival meningiomas (PCMs), which are typically located from the dorsum sellae to the upper border of the internal auditory meatus (IAM). Although neurosurgeons can resect over this area if the tumor is detached from the dura, tumors within the indication area for PCMs are not appropriate for the ATP approach, because it can be difficult to evaluate whether the tumor is attached to or only touching the dura. In this study, we investigated the tumor extension area based on an evaluation of the feeding artery to achieve a more accurate assessment of the dural attachment area.
   METHODS: Using various angiography techniques, we studied 51 feeding arteries from 24 patients who had undergone surgical treatment of primary petroapex meningiomas and PCMs via the ATP approach. We measured the lower and posterior extension distances, the extension rate of the cavernous sinus and Meckel's cave, and the midline extension rate of the tumors.
   RESULTS: The ascending pharyngeal artery (AphA) was the predominant feeding artery for tumors with lower extension. We determined that tumors extending over the lower border of IAM in cases in which the feeding artery was not the AphA can be resected using the ATP approach.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows an association between the predominant feeding artery and tumor extension area and demonstrates that an evaluation of the dural attachment area based on the feeding artery can aid selection of the appropriate surgical approach.

AB BACKGROUND: Hospital leaders are seeking ways to improve resource utilization and minimize long postoperative hospital stays. Common explanations for extended length of stay (LOS) are baseline patient illness, postoperative complications, and physician practice differences. The degree to which extended LOS represents illness severity or postoperative complications is unknown. We investigated influence of postoperative complications and patient comorbidities on extended LOS after lumbar spine surgery in elderly patients.
   METHODS: This retrospective cohort study from 2008 to 2014 analyzed data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program for elderly patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. Patient demographics, comorbidities, LOS, and complications were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to determine odds ratio for risk-adjusted LOS. Primary outcome was the degree extended LOS represented patient illness or postoperative complications.
   RESULTS: Of 9482 patients, 1909 (20.13%) had extended LOS. A few patients with extended LOS had a history of relevant comorbidities, including diabetes (21.76%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (8.17%), congestive heart failure (0.94%), myocardial infarction (0%), acute renal failure (0.47%), and stroke (2.23%). Of patients with normal LOS, 93% had no complications, 5.19% had 1 complication, and 1.69% had >1 complication. Among patients with extended LOS, 73.65% had no complications, 18.96% had 1 complication, and 7.39% had >1 complication (P < 0.000).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that much of the variation in LOS for elderly patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery is not attributable to baseline patient illness or postoperative complications and most likely represents differences in practice style or surgeon preference.

AB BACKGROUND: Wound infections after adult spinal deformity surgery place a high toll on patients, providers, and the healthcare system. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of postoperative wound infections, and nasal colonization by this organism may be an important factor in the development of surgical site infections (SSIs). The aim is to investigate whether post-operative surgical site infections after elective spine surgery occur at a higher rate in patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) nasal colonization.
   METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing adult spinal deformity surgery between 2011-2013 were enrolled. Enrolled patients were followed up for a minimum of 3 months after surgery and received similar peri-operative infection prophylaxis. Baseline characteristics, operative details, rates of wound infection, and microbiologic data for each case of post-operative infection were gathered by direct medical record review. Local vancomycin powder was used in all patients and sub-fascial drains were used in the majority (88%) of patients.
   RESULTS: 1200 operative spine cases were performed for deformity between 2011 and 2013. The mean +/- standard deviation age and body mass index were 62.08 +/- 14.76 years and 30.86 +/- 7.15 kg/m(2), respectively. 29.41% had a history of diabetes. All SS's occurred within 30 days of surgery, with deep wound infections accounting for 50% of all SSIs. Of the 34 (2.83%) cases of SSIs that were identified, only 1 case occurred in a patient colonized with MRSA.
   CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the preponderance of SSIs occurred in patients without nasal colonization by methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Future prospective multi-institutional studies are needed to corroborate our findings.

AB OBJECTIVE: An enlarged fourth ventricle, otherwise known as fourth ventriculomegaly (4th VM), has been reported previously in the pediatric population, yet literature on adults is scant. We report our experience with 4th VM in adults over an 11-year period and review the literature.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective chart review of adult patients with the diagnosis of 4th VM admitted to the intensive care unit in a tertiary care center.
   RESULTS: Nine patients were identified with 4th VM. Most presented with symptoms in the posterior fossa. Five cases were related to previous shunting and the underlying neurosurgical diseases, and average time interval to develop symptoms was 5.3 years. We divided our cases into primary, acquired, and degenerative based on the pathophysiology involved. Treatments included extended subzero cerebrospinal fluid diversion using a frontal external ventricular drain followed by low-pressure shunt revision, endoscopic third ventriculostomy, suboccipital decompression, and fourth ventricular catheter placement. Literature review identified additional published cases, and there were no reports of a formal classification scheme or treatment algorithm.
   CONCLUSIONS: This case series illustrates a narrow spectrum of etiologies associated with 4th VM in adults. We propose a simple classification scheme dividing 4th VM into 3 categories: primary, acquired, and degenerative. We recommend a stepwise treatment approach starting with extended subzero cerebrospinal fluid diversion followed by shunting for symptomatic primary and acquired 4th VM. Lower success rates and greater morbidity are associated with rescue procedures such as fourth ventricle drainage catheters, endoscopic third ventriculostomies, and skull base decompression.

   LOCALIZATION; DIAGNOSIS; LESIONS
AB BACKGROUND: Primary elements of surgical treatment of cavernous angiomas (CAs) are precise lesion identification and optimal trajectory determination. Navigation techniques allow for better results compared to microsurgery alone. In this study, we examined the benefits of intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) use as an adjunct to standard localization systems.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 59 CAs, comparing outcomes in 2 groups of patients: 34 who underwent frame-based or frameless navigation-assisted microsurgery (no-IOUS group) and 25 who underwent IOUS-guided microsurgery associated with these techniques (IOUS group).
   RESULTS: The use of IOUS did not significantly increase the surgery time (mean, 172 +/- 1.7 minutes in the IOUS group and 192.6 +/- 11.5 in no-IOUS group; P = 0.08). In all 25 patients in the IOUS group, IOUS allowed for ready identification of CA as a hyperechoic mass. At the last follow-up (mean, 41.7 +/- 3.5 months postsurgery), 95.2% of the IOUS group and 80.8% of the no-IOUS group had a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-1 and an Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 7-8 (P = 0.2), with 100% and 64%, respectively, included in Engel outcome scale class IA (P = 0.006). Complete removal, as confirmed on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging, was achieved in all patients in the IOUS group and in almost all (97.1%; P = 0.4) patients in the no-IOUS group.
   CONCLUSIONS: IOUS is a valid tool for the intraoperative identification of CAs. Implementation of standard localization methods with IOUS guidance was associated with complete resection in all cases, without increasing surgical time. Compared with microsurgery without IOUS guidance, long-term functional outcomes showed better trends, and the epilepsy-free rate was significantly higher.

AB BACKGROUND: Although an abundance of literature about the treatment of chronic subdural hematoma is available, it provides little evidence to clarify which treatment is most successful.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine and compare current clinical standards between several hospitals.
   METHODS: Chairmen of all neurosurgical units in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, as listed on the national neurosurgical societies' websites, were invited to participate with a personal token to access a web-based survey. A total of 159 invitations were sent and up to 5 reminder e-mails.
   RESULTS: Eighty-four invitees (53%) completed the survey. The most common surgical intervention was a single burr hole in 52 (65%) of the responding neurosurgical units, double burr holes were performed as primary procedure in 16 centers (20%h a small osteoplastic craniotomy in 4 (5%), and a twist drill craniostomy in 8 (10%). Seventy-two (90%) would place a drain in estimated 75%-100% of cases or whenever possible/safe. Sixty-five used subdural-external drains, and 7 used subgaleal-external drains. Seventeen applied suction to the drains. Thirty-six (49%) agreed with the statement that watchful waiting was an option for the treatment of chronic subdural hematomas and 19 (23.4%) disagreed. Eighteen (23%) would consider corticosteroids and 34 (45%) tranexamic acid as part of their armamentarium for the treatment of subdural hematomas.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey reflect the current evidence available in literature. Although the benefits of using of a drain are widely recognized, no consensus regarding the type of drain and surgical approach to the hematoma was reached.

AB OBJECTIVE: Metronomic (daily low-dose) chlorambucil requires further study before use in human patients with glioma. The aim of this study was to investigate distribution and safety of metronomic chlorambucil in naturally occurring canine glioma.
   METHODS: Eight client-owned (pet) dogs with newly diagnosed spontaneous glioma were prospectively enrolled. Chlorambucil was administered preoperatively at 4 mg/m(2) every 24 hours for >= 3 days and continued post- operatively until death or dose-limiting adverse events. Chlorambucil concentrations in the surgical glioma specimen, cerebrospinal fluid, and serum were analyzed. Dogs additionally received lomustine postoperatively. Dogs were monitored for seizures, myoclonus, cytopenias, and tumor recurrence.
   RESULTS: Complete microsurgical resection was achieved in 7 oligodendrogliomas and 1 astrocytoma (6 high grade, 2 low grade). Median surgical glioma specimen chlorambucil concentration was 0.52 ng/g (range, 0-2.62 ng/g), or 37% (range, 0%-178%) of serum concentration. Median cerebrospinal fluid concentration was 0.1 ng/ml. (range, 0-0.3 ng/mL). Chlorambucil was not associated with increase in seizure activity. Six dogs displayed prolonged seizure-free intervals. There was no myoclonus. Three dogs developed asymptomatic thrombocytopenia after 8-12 months of chlorambucil. Median progression-free survival was 253 days (range, 63-860 days). Median overall survival was 257 days (range, 64-860 days).
   CONCLUSIONS: The presence of intratumoral chlorambucil indicated an altered blood-brain barrier that varied from case to case. Despite sporadic previous reports of neurotoxicity, prolonged seizure-free intervals supported a high safety margin at this dose in this species. Metronomic chlorambucil was well tolerated. Spontaneous canine glioma offers a robust preclinical model.

AB OBJECTIVE: The Barrow Innovation Center consists of an educational program that promotes interdisciplinary collaboration among neurosurgery, legal, and engineering professionals to foster the development of new medical devices. This report describes a common issue faced during the placement of ventricular shunts for the treatment of hydrocephalus and the solution to this problem that was developed through the Barrow Innovation Center.
   METHODS: Neurosurgery residents involved in the Barrow Innovation Center presented the problem of ferromagnetic retractors interfering with pinless image-guidance systems at a monthly meeting. Potential solutions were openly discussed by an interdisciplinary committee of neurosurgeons, patent lawyers, and biomedical engineers. The committee decided to pursue development of a novel self-retaining retractor made of nonferromagnetic material as a solution to the problem.
   RESULTS: Each retractor design was tested in the cadaver laboratory for size and functionality. A final design was chosen and used in a surgical case requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. The new retractor successfully retracted the scalp without interfering with the electromagnetic image-guidance system.
   CONCLUSIONS: Through the interdisciplinary Barrow Innovation Center program, a newly designed, 3-dimensional-printed skin and soft-tissue retractor was created, along with an innovative universal shunt retainer. Through this integrated program dedicated to surgical innovation (i.e., the Barrow Innovation Center), the process of developing and implementing new technology at our institution has been streamlined, creating a culture of innovation within the neurosurgery training program.

AB OBJECTIVE: Fusion surgery for lumbar degenerative stenosis is an established treatment mode. Despite comparable patient-related outcomes and radiologic results, the necessity of adding interbody fusion to posterolateral fusion remains controversial. We aimed to compare the clinical and radiologic outcomes of posterolateral fusion and transforaminal interbody fusion techniques in degenerative lumbar stenosis with or without spondylolisthesis.
   METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the clinical and radiologic outcomes of 48 patients who underwent decompression plus either posterolateral fusion (PLF; n = 23) or transforaminal interbody fusion (TLIF) plus PLF (TLIF+PLF; n = 25) procedures, which incorporated 71 segments for degenerative lumbar stenosis with or without spondylolisthesis.
   RESULTS: The median follow-up duration for the PLF and TLIF groups were 26 and 31 months, respectively. Both procedures significantly improved the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scale (VAS) scores; however, the postoperative ODI and VAS scores were unaffected by the procedure type. Postoperative disc heights and percent changes in disc heights did not change by operation type; however, the percent change in the foramen areas was significantly greater in the TLIF group. The addition of TLIF to the PLF procedure resulted in significantly longer operating time and more intraoperative blood loss. Cerebrospinal fluid fistula was the only major complication noted. The radiologic fusion rates were similar between both study groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both PLF and TLIF+PLF procedures were effective in ameliorating the symptoms of degenerative lumbar stenosis and spondylolisthesis. Although some radiologic parameters favor TLIF, this was not reflected in the clinical outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neuroglobin (Ngb) has a high affinity for oxygen and helps prevent hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. In this study we analyzed the relationship between Ngb levels and clinical outcomes of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH).
   METHODS: Serum Ngb levels were measured in 58 patients with aSAH and 27 control individuals using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To continuously assess aSAH, we measured serum Ngb levels on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after aSAH. Clinical data were collected using the Hunt and Hess Scale, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) Scale, and the modified Fisher Scale. Clinical outcomes included 6-month mortality and 6-month unfavorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3-6).
   RESULTS: Serum Ngb levels increased after aSAH, peaked on day 2, and then gradually decreased. Serum Ngb levels on admission were higher in the patient group than in the control group (7.67 +/- 2.56 ng/mL vs. 6.45 +/- 0.88 ng/ml, P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that serum Ngb levels on day 2 after aSAH were independently related to 6-month mortality (odds ratio [011] = 0.265, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.094-0.747, P < 0.05) and 6-month unfavorable outcomes (OR = 1.919, 95% CI = 1.158-3.180, P < 0.05), and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that serum Ngb levels on day 2 predicted 6-month mortality and 6-month unfavorable outcomes, with areas under the curve of 0.893 (P < 0.05; 95% CI, 0.812-0.974) and 0.818 (P < 0.05; 95% CI, 0.691-0.954), respectively, based on the best thresholds.
   CONCLUSIONS: Serum Ngb levels on day 2 after aSAH were strongly associated with poor outcomes in aSAH, suggesting that Ngb may be a novel biomarker for predicting poor outcomes in aSAH.

AB BACKGROUND: The reporting of adverse event:, (AEs) in neurosurgery uses inconsistent definitions and subjective grading systems. A standardized system for recording and describing AEs would allow valid comparisons to be drawn between different institutions, using different technologies, at different times. The Spinal Adverse Events Severity System - Neuro (SAVES-N) system is a modification of the well-validated SAVES-V2 system that encompasses complications from both cranial and spinal surgery. The objective of this study was to assess the interobserver reliability of SAVES-N in spinal and cranial neurosurgery.
   METHODS: Ten vignettes, including cranial and spinal neurosurgical cases, were assessed by groups of consultant neurosurgeons (n = 5) and neurosurgical registrars (n = 5) using the SAVES-N system. Interobserver reliability for the presence of AEs, the type of AE, and the SAVES severity grade of the AE were calculated using Gwet's AC2 and Fleiss' kappa and were interpreted using the thresholds described by Landis and Koch.
   RESULTS: Neurosurgeons had almost-perfect agreement (Gwet AC2 = 0.93), whereas registrars had substantial agreement (Gwet's AC2 = 0.74) in determining the presence or absence of AEs. Both neurosurgeons (Fleiss' kappa = 0.78) and registrars (Fleiss' kappa = 0.70) demonstrated substantial agreement within their groups as to the type of AE. Similarly, neurosurgeons (Gwet's AC2 = 0.94) and registrars (Gwet's AC2 = 0.81) both graded the severity of the AE with almost perfect agreement.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate that the scope of the well-validated SAVES-V2 system may be broadened to cranial neurosurgical cases by SAVES-N with substantial to almost-perfect interobserver reliability.

AB BACKGROUND: Vasospasm is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Early treatment of ruptured aneurysms is advocated; delayed intervention complicates the treatment strategy leading to significant vasospasm and poor prognosis. We report an endovascular protocol for occlusion of the unsecured aneurysm and angioplasty for vasospasm in a single session.
   METHODS: Between January 2011 and May 2017, among 660 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, 24 patients with significant vasospasm and unsecured ruptured cerebral aneurysm were reviewed. Continuous nimodipine drip through a pressure line of the guiding catheter was set up. Aggressive angioplasty with a compliant balloon catheter either before or after embolization of the aneurysm in the major branches of vasospastic territory was performed. The goal was complete embolization of the aneurysm.
   RESULTS: Of 24 patients, 17 had ischemic symptoms at presentation, and the average delay from aneurysm rupture to presentation was 7.58 days. Angioplasty and nimodipine drip were performed on all patients. Severity of vasospasm was significantly reduced, and outcome improved in each patient. Two patients required a second angioplasty. In 20 patients, embolization of aneurysms was achieved without any aneurysmal sac or residual neck. Clinical outcome was good recovery (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) in 23 patients (95.8%) and moderate disability in 1 patient (modified Rankin Scale score 3).
   CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive endovascular treatment of patients with unsecured ruptured cerebral aneurysm and associated vasospasm is safe and effective.

AB OBJECTIVE: Factors associated with favorable outcome after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs) with cortical venous reflux (CVR) are not completely understood. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the outcomes after SRS for high-grade DAVFs and identify predictors.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of consecutive patients with high-grade DAVFs, defined as the presence of CVR, who underwent SRS between 1939 and 2017. The primary outcome was defined as DAVF obliteration without a new permanent neurologic deficit. Predictors of outcomes were determined using multivariate logistic regression.
   RESULTS: The study cohort was composed of 41 high-grade DAVF patients with a mean age of 52 years. DAVF obliteration without a new permanent neurologic deficit was achieved in 62% of patients (13/21). The rates of complete obliteration and new permanent neurologic deficit were 63% (17/27) and 23% (7/30) of patients, respectively. No independent predictors of the primary outcome or angiographic obliteration were identified in the multivariate model. Presentation with a nonhemorrhagic neurologic deficit (NHND) was found to he an independent predictor of a new permanent neurologic deficit after SRS (odds ratio, 14.176; 95% confidence interval, 1.119-179.540; P = 0.041).
   CONCLUSIONS: Obliteration without a new permanent neurologic deficit can be achieved in most appropriately selected patients with high-grade DAVFs after treatment with SRS. NHND at presentation is a risk factor for new permanent neurologic deficit after SRS.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare short-term clinical and radiologic outcomes of anterior fusion-nonfusion hybrid surgery (cervical discectomy or corpectomy and fusion combine with cervical disc replacement) and posterior cervical laminoplasty for multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
   METHODS: From January 2014 to December 2015, 105 patients who underwent anterior fusion-nonfusion hybrid surgery (AHS group, n = 48) or posterior cervical lam- inoplasty (n = 57) for >= 3 disc levels cervical spondylotic myelopathy were included. The Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, complications, and radiologic results including cervical curvature and cervical range of motion (ROM) were compared between the 2 groups of patients. The complications that occurred within 1 month after the surgery were recorded as early complications, otherwise they were considered late complications.
   RESULTS: Both groups gained significant JOA scores improvement (P < 0.05). No significant difference in JOA improvement was found between the 2 groups (P> 0.05). The cervical curvature increased significantly in the AHS group (P = 0.024), whereas it decreased significantly in the posterior cervical laminoplasty group (P = 0.002). Cervical ROM of both groups significantly decreased after the surgery (P < 0.05). The preoperative and final follow-up cervical RUM, together with the total cervical ROM preservation rate were not significant different between the 2 groups P > 0.05). The AHS group had a significant higher early complication rate (22/48 vs. 15/57; P = 0.037) and a lower late complication rate (9/48 vs. 21/57; P = 0.041).
   CONCLUSIONS: Both anterior fusion-nonfusion hybrid surgery and cervical laminoplasty could gain satisfied neurological recovery. The anterior hybrid surgery may preserve cervical curvature with a higher early complication rate and a lower late complication rate than cervical laminoplasty.

AB OBJECTIVE: Using a database that enabled longitudinal follow-up, we assessed the cost, outcome, complications, and readmission rate of ruptured cerebral aneurysms repaired by surgical clipping and endovascular coiling.
   METHODS: This study was a retrospective review of data from a series of patients who underwent surgical clipping or endovascular coiling of ruptured cerebral aneurysms between 1996 and 2013. The medical records and hospital cost data were all examined.
   RESULTS: A total of 7690 and 1380 cases were treated with clipping and coiling, respectively. Patients treated with clipping had more comorbidities and were older. The average total cost for endovascular coiling was $13,974.3, whereas the average total cost for surgical clipping was $16,581.7. Perioperative (30-day) mortality was 10.7% in patients with coiled aneurysms, compared with 12.6% in those with clipped aneurysms (P = 0.045). After 1 year of follow-up, clipping was associated with a significantly longer length of hospital stay (P < 0.001) and significantly higher total hospital costs (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: In Taiwan, the total hospital costs for the surgical clipping of cerebral aneurysms were higher than for endovascular coiling, and the surgical results were associated with significant complications. We suggest that the indications for coiling might need to be expanded from the current standards dictated by the guidelines in Taiwan.

AB OBJECTIVE: To reveal the characteristics of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) in a plateau area based on the Tibetan population.
   METHODS: Data of Tibetan and Han patients (control group) with sICH treated at our center from January 2013 to April 2017 were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: A total of 122 Tibetan and 927 Han patients were included. Compared with Han patients, Tibetan patients were older (54.7 +/- 11.2 vs. 50.9 +/- 18.3 years, P = 0.027), exhibited higher male-to-female ratios (73.8% vs. 55.0%, P< 0.001), were more overweight (22.1% vs. 13.1%, P = 0.007) had more smokers (36.9% vs. 20.5%, P < 0.001), had a higher concentration of hemoglobin (163.7 +/- 17.6 vs. 134.8 +/- 20.2 g/L, P < 0.001), and included a higher number of patients with hypertension (83.6% vs. 60.5%, P < 0.001), diabetes mellitus (19.2% vs. 9.3%, P = 0.002), and prior hemorrhagic stroke (9.0% vs. 2.0%, P < 0.001). Tibetan patients also experienced more bra instem hemorrhage (11.5% vs. 5.1%, P = 0.039) in the infratentorial region and had a higher risk of in-hospital complications resulting from hematoma enlargement (20.5% vs. 10.4%, P = 0.002) and cerebral infarction (59.0% vs. 9.7%, P < 0.001). During a 6-month follow-up period, they had higher rates of unfavorable outcomes and case mortality (P < 0.05). A multivariable analysis adjusted for confounding factors revealed that the Tibetan race was positively associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in sICH patients (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Tibetan sICH patients from the plateau area presented unique characteristics in their baseline measurements, incidence of comorbidities, hematoma location, risk of in-hospital complications, and clinical outcomes compared with Han patients. The Tibetan race was positively associated with unfavorable 6-month outcomes in ICH patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Optimal drainage after debridement for treating postoperative surgical site infection (SSI) is controversial. We compared single-tube drainage with double-tube drainage.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1125 patients with lumbar degenerative disease who underwent lumbar surgery. Postoperative SSI was diagnosed in 26 patients, and these patients were divided into 2 groups: single-tube drainage group (1 drain) and double-tube drainage group (2 drains).
   RESULTS: The 26 adult patients (17 women and 9 men) with postoperative SSI after lumbar surgery (26/1125 [2.3%]) were treated with debridement. There were no significant differences in patient age, sex, body mass index, mean number of pedicle screws, operative time, amount of bleeding, and drainage between the 2 groups. There were no significant differences between groups in administration of antibiotics (P> 0.05). Bacterial cultures were routinely performed in all 26 cases of SSI; 80.7% (21/26) of patients had a positive culture. Staphylococcus species, including predominantly S. aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and S. epidermidis, were the most common pathogens, followed by Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis. There were no significant differences in drainage efficiency between the 1 drain and 2 drains groups (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences between the 1 drain and 2 drains groups in surgery-related and patient-related risk factors, pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic therapy, laboratory tests results, or drainage efficiency and time. However, patients in the 1 drain group exhibited better clinical outcome and shorter hospital stay.

AB BACKGROUND: Thoracic corpectomies are performed for various reasons, including spinal deformity, trauma, neoplasms, and infection. Regardless of indication, both anterior and posterior approaches are surgical options, selected based on pathology, anatomy, patient characteristics, and surgical experience. Risk profiles and outcomes for these procedures are poorly characterized, however, and the choice between the 2 approaches remains inconclusive.
   OBJECTIVE: To compare risk factors and complications for adult patients undergoing anterior and posterior thoracic corpectomies.
   METHODS: A review of the American College of Surgeons National Quality Improvement Program database was performed, with 30-day patient outcomes after anterior or posterior thoracic corpectomy queried from 2005 to 2016. Preoperative risk factors and postoperative outcomes (e.g., deaths, reoperations, readmissions) were identified and compared.
   RESULTS: In total, 1327 corpectomies were studied, 861 (64.9%) by an anterior approach and 465 (35.1%) by a posterior approach. Patients undergoing a posterior approach were generally male, older, and had a greater American Association of Anesthesiologists class, whereas those subject to anterior approaches had a greater average body mass index. After we controlled for these baseline characteristics, no significant difference to postoperative events was observed, with 9.3% of anterior approach patients and 7.1% of posterior approach patients returning to the operating room within 30 days.
   CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference in rates of reoperation, readmission, death, average length of stay, or medical complications exists between anterior and posterior thoracic corpectomy approaches. Both have relatively low-risk profiles and, in situations in which either strategy is reasonable, each can be selected at the surgeon's discretion with comparable risk.

AB BACKGROUND: Microscopic detection of intracranial brain tumors with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) has proven extremely useful, and reports the use of 5-ALA have recently increased. However, few reports have described 5-ALA photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) using a neuroendoscope. We performed neuroendoscopic 5-ALA PDD for various brain lesions and present a procedure using only a neuroendoscope.
   METHODS: We describe the diagnosis of 20 intracranial brain lesion cases with a 5-ALA-guided fluorescence endoscope. A light-emitting diode that emitted either white light or 400- to 410-nm violet light was attached to a neuroendoscope. We performed cylinder surgery with a transparent sheath under observation with a rigid neuroendoscope.
   RESULTS: Neuroendoscopic biopsies were performed in 11 patients, and resections were performed in 9 patients. All lesions were observed with a neuroendoscope under sequential white light and violet light. We confirmed the presence of a red fluorescent lesion under violet light in 15 patients, including 4 of 5 glioblastoma cases (80%); 1 of 2 anaplastic astrocytoma cases (50%), 4 of 5 diffuse large B cell lymphoma cases (80%); 2 of 2 metastatic brain tumors; 1 of 1 case each of diffuse astrocytoma, pilocytic astrocytoma, inflammatory change, and germinoma (100%); and no cases of anaplastic ependymoma or cysticercosis. Pretargeted lesions were accurately harvested from all biopsy specimens. Gross total resection was achieved in 5 of 9 patients using a resection procedure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our described method offers a promising technique for achieving precise brain tumor biopsies and safe resection.

AB OBJECTIVE: Previous studies have described neuro-endoscopic lavage (NEL) as a procedure for the treatment of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in newborn infants. This report describes complications and results in an extended case series from 2 separate hospitals.
   METHODS: Patient records were screened for NEL procedures performed on infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus between September 2010 and May 2016 (minimum follow-up period of 12 months). Efficacy of blood removal-as assessed with cerebral ultrasound, complications, eventual shunt placement rate, and subsequent shunt revisions-were recorded.
   RESULTS: Fifty-six patients (35 male) underwent NEL at a postmenstrual median age of 31 weeks and 2 days (range, 26 weeks and 1 day to 52 weeks and 3 days) and a median weight of 1523 g (range, 734-4360 g). Median follow-up was 34 months (range, 12-80). Three patients died, and 31 patients required permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunting. There was no significant correlation between the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting and gestational age (P = 0.05), birth weight (P = 0.07), age (P = 0.17), or weight (P = 0.59) after NEL. The median number of surgical interventions per patient was 2 (range, 1-7 interventions). Revision-free shunt survival was 63.6% at 12 and 56.2% at 24 months.
   CONCLUSIONS: NEL avoided shunt placement in 43% of newborn infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. In the shunted cohort, NEL may have also decreased the frequency of subsequent shunt revisions. The influence of NEL on neurodevelopment and safety remains to be investigated further in a multicenter setup.

AB BACKGROUND: Literature about traumatic brain injury caused by missile wounds is scanty. We shed some light on this field.
   METHODS: This retrospective study was carried out, between September 2000 and September 2010, on 520 civilian patients who sustained traumatic brain injury from missiles in the north of Palestine. Thorough detailed analyses were made of patients' admission Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, pupillary reactivity to light, site and mode of injuries, type of injurious agents, missile trajectory, method of treatment, radiologic manifestations, complications, and outcome. The GCS score was used to assess the level of consciousness, whereas the Glasgow Outcome Scale score was used to evaluate the outcome.
   RESULTS: Patients' age ranged from 6 months to 75 years. Only 50 (9.6%) patients were female. Patients injured by metallic bullets, rubber bullets, and shrapnel from bomb explosions numbered 351, 139, and 30, respectively. Of 384 patients who were treated conservatively, no mortality was detected, whereas of 136 surgically treated patients, 66 (48.5%) died of their injuries. Although our management of patients was not optimal because of many factors, the overall mortality was 12.7% (n = 66).
   CONCLUSIONS: The promptness of transport to hospital was a decisive factor with a major bearing on decreasing mortality. Brain computed tomography was invaluable in the diagnosis and follow-up of our patients. In addition, age, pupillary reactivity, admission GCS score, missile trajectory, ventricular involvement, and site and mode of injury were important prognostic factors.

AB OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for predicting post-traumatic hydrocephalus (PTH) development after traumatic brain injury in patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy (DC).
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 121 patients who underwent DC performed by 6 different neuro-surgeons after traumatic brain injury between January 2013 and December 2016 at Yijishan Hospital and were still alive at 6-month follow-up. Patients were divided into PTH group and non-PTH group. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify PTH potential risk factors based on results obtained from univariate analysis. Power of the regression model to discriminate PTH from non-PTH was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve.
   RESULTS: With Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score cutoff value of 6, GCS scores <6 on admission, craniectomy site, and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) were significant predictors for development of PTH after DC. Receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that a final predictive model composed of these 3 factors (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.866, sensitivity = 0.78, and specificity = 0.83) was significantly better than each single model (AUC = 0.750 for GCS scores on admission, AUC = 0.650 for craniectomy site, AUC = 0.572 for IVH). A significantly positive association was found between patients' Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended scores and GCS scores on admission, whereas a significantly negative association was found between IVH, craniectomy site, and Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended.
   CONCLUSIONS: GCS scores <6 on admission, presence of IVH on first head computed tomography scan, and need for bilateral DC might be used to predict whether patients with traumatic brain injury after DC will develop PTH. The reliability of this specific combination might be useful for clinicians to make a correct prediction.

AB OBJECTIVE: Application of AO spine injury classification system (AOSICS) to identify the timing of operation for different types of traumatic thoracic/thoracolumbar incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI).
   METHODS: A single-center prospective cohort study was conducted to enroll patients with thoracic/thoracolumbar incomplete SCI from April 2013 to November 2016; they were divided into an early group (<24 hours after SCI) and a late group (24-72 hours after SCI). Each group was divided into A, B, C subgroups according to AOSICS. The primary outcomes were ordinal changes in ASIA Impairment Scale at 12-month follow-up. The secondary outcomes included the Medical outcomes study 36-term short form health survey physical component summary (PCS), complications, mortality, and hospital length of stay (LOS).
   RESULTS: Seven hundred twenty-one patients with thoracic/thoracolumbar incomplete SCI were included; 335 patients underwent early surgery, and 386 patients underwent delayed surgery. Statistical results included the following comparisons of the early versus late groups: AIS improvement of 1 grade or more (combined groups: P = 0.009, odds ratio [OR] = 1.487; A: P = 0.777, OR = 1.072; B: P = 0.029, OR = 1.701; C: P = 0.007, OR = 1.762), AIS improvement 2 grades or more (combined groups: P = 0.002, OR = 2.471; A: P = 0.189, OR = 3.939; B: P= 0.011, OR = 2.550; C: P = 0.035, OR = 3.964) and PCS (combined groups: P= 0.327; A: P = 0.776; B: P= 0.019; C: P = 0.562). LOS (combined groups: P < 0.0001; A, B and C: P < 0.0001). Complications (combined groups: P = 0.267; A: P = 0.830; B: P = 0.111; C: P = 0.757).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type-A injuries with incomplete SCI do not have to undergo aggressive early operations. Patients with type-B and type-C injuries should undergo an operation early to achieve better clinical results.

AB OBJECTIVE: Hemispherectomy has been used successfully for patients with medically intractable epilepsy. However, it is difficult to predict postoperative motor function. The aim of the present study was to analyze whether the preoperative asymmetry of cerebral peduncles could be used to predict motor function restoration before hemispherectomy for young patients with medically intractable epilepsy.
   METHODS: The clinical record and magnetic resonance imaging data of 53 patients were analyzed retrospectively. The correlation between preoperative cerebral peduncle asymmetry ratio (pCPAR) and pre- and postoperative changes in motor function was evaluated, as well as the influencing factors for pCPAR, such as duration and etiology factors. The restoration of motor function was defined as changes in pre- and postoperative hemiparesis.
   RESULTS: The pCPARs of patients with improved and unchanged hemiparesis were significantly greater than that of worsened patients. Patients with a pCPAR of more than 1.5 had an obvious restorative capacity of motor function of the intact hemisphere, and these patients had a lower risk of worsening hemiparesis. The duration in the improved/unchanged and worsened groups was 5.84 +/- 3.85 years and 2.67 +/- 2.03 years, respectively. Furthermore, there were more patients with no-progressive pathology in the group in whom pCPAR was more than 1.5.
   CONCLUSIONS: pCPAR is a useful and objective indicator for predicting the restoration of motor function in pediatric patients with medically intractable epilepsy before hemispherectomy. Most patients with nonprogressive pathology and a duration of more than 5 years presented with greater pCPARs, exhibited better restoration of motor function, and had less risk of worsening hemiparesis.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common complication after spine surgery, with particularly high rates after adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery. Few studies have been conducted on predictors of POI following ASD surgery. The objective of this study was to determine risk factors for POI in patients undergoing ASD surgery and to determine association between POI and inhospital mortality, length of stay, and total charges.
   METHODS: Data were obtained from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample, years 2010-2014. Patients with ASD >= 26 years-old were selected using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Multiple logistic and linear regressions were used.
   RESULTS: The analysis included 59,410 patients; 7.4% of patients had POI. On adjusted analysis, the following variables were associated with increased risk of POI: male sex (OR = 1.43; CI, 1.10-1.85), anterior surgical approach (OR = 1.78; CI, 1.22-2.60), >= 9 levels fused (OR = 1.84; CI, 1.24-2.73), electrolyte disorders (OR = 2.70; CI, 2.15-3.39), and pathologic weight loss (OR = 1.94; CI, 1.08-3.46). POI was associated with significantly longer length of stay (+39% [CI, 29%-51%]) and higher total charges (+23% [CI, 14%-31%]).
   CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for POI were identified. Length of stay was 2.9 days longer in patients with POI, and total charges were approximately $80,000 higher. These results may be applied clinically to identify patients at risk of POI and to address modifiable risk factors preoperatively. Future studies should be conducted with additional data to develop models capable of accurately predicting and preventing POI.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of cigarette smoking on the development of wound complications, including wound dehiscence, superficial infection, deep infection, or organ space infection, within the first 30 postoperative days in patients undergoing surgery for spondylolisthesis.
   METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database for the years 2012-2014 was used to identify adult patients who underwent single-level posterolateral fusion (PLF) or interbody fusion for spondylolisthesis. Wound complications occurring within 30 days were compared between current smokers and nonsmokers.
   RESULTS: A total of 1688 patients who underwent single-level PLF or interbody fusion for spondylolisthesis were identified, among whom 271 were current smokers (16.1%). The overall wound complication rate was 3.3% for smokers versus 1.8% for nonsmokers (P = 0.095). When stratified by operative technique, the rate of wound complications was not significantly different between smokers and nonsmokers undergoing PLF (2.4% vs. 2.6%; P = 1.00); however, smokers who underwent interbody fusion were more likely to experience a woundcomplication compared with nonsmokers undergoing interbody fusion (3.7% vs. 1.3%; P = 0.028). On multivariate analysis, smoking was an independent predictor of organ/space infection irrespective of fusion technique used (odds ratio, 15.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-175.4; P = 0.028).
   CONCLUSIONS: The rate of wound complications was not higher in smokers undergoing PLF alone, but was significantly higher in smokers who underwent interbody fusion. However, multivariate analysis identified smoking as an independent predictor of organ/space infection irrespective of fusion technique used.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has on postoperative complication rates, ambulation, and hospital length of stay for elderly spinal deformity patients after elective spinal fusion (>= 3 levels).
   METHODS: The medical records of 559 elderly (60 years old) spine deformity patients undergoing elective spinal fusion (>= 3 levels) at a major academic institution from 2005 to 2015 were reviewed. We identified 60 patients with COPD (10.7%) and 499 patients without COPD (89.3%). Patient demographics, comorbidities, postoperative complications, ambulatory status, and readmission rates were collected. The primary outcomes investigated in this study were complication rates and length of hospital stay.
   RESULTS: Demographics and comorbidities were similar between groups, with a difference in proportion of smokers (COPD group: 25.0% vs. no COPD group: 9.6%, P = 0.0004). The median number of fusion levels (P = 0.840), operative time (P = 0.842), estimated blood loss (P = 0.336), and incidences of durotomy (P = 0258) was similar between both cohorts. The COPD cohort experienced a higher rate of postoperative fever (10.0% vs. 3.0%, P = 0.007) and pneumonia (5.0% vs. 0.4%, P = 0.0004), respectively. There was a significant difference in the number of feet walked on the first day of ambulation after surgery (COPD group: 58.6 +/- 1 78.4 vs. no COPD group: 84.0 +/- 102.8, P = 0.040). Length of hospital stay was significantly longer in the COPD cohort than the no COPD cohort (7.7 +/- 6 .4vs. 6.0 +/- 4.0 days, respectively; P = 0.0498).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that elderly patients with COPD have increased lengths of stay and higher rates of postoperative pneumonia after spinal fusion. This determination identifies a potentially modifiable risk factor for increased utilization of health care resources.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of early or delayed decompressive craniotomy for patients with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction.
   METHODS: A prospective randomized study was carried out of a series of 46 consecutive patients with malignant middle cerebral artery territory infarction. Patients were divided randomly into 2 groups: group I, 27 patients who were followed until obvious deterioration of level of consciousness; group II, 19 patients who were operated on prophylactically in 6 hours of presentation even with no clear deterioration of level of consciousness or radiologic findings. Patients were assessed clinically using the Glasgow Coma Scale, motor power by the United Kingdom Medical Research Council, and functionally by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin Scale. Radiologically, patients had primary magnetic resonance imaging on admission, followed by computed tomography scan. Infarction behavior including volume of infarct area, midline shift, and secondary hemorrhage were calculated.
   RESULTS: At final follow-up, both groups showed good improvement in level of consciousness, motor power, and functional outcome; however, statistically significant neurologic improvement was shown in group II. Functional outcome also showed statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05) in this ultraearly decompression group (group II). There was a significant difference in mortality in both groups; more than half (52%) of group I died as a result of delay in surgery or its other consequences. Another significant difference was in the progression of infarction volume, which was observed more in group I (statistically insignificant).
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite the possible complications from surgery, early decompressive craniotomy (within 6 hours of ictus without waiting for neurologic deterioration) has a significant impact on prognosis. Delay in transferring the patient, diagnosing the condition, or taking the decision of surgery significantly affects mortality and overall outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: One of the most challenging aspects of surgical treatment of tuberculum sellae meningioma is to control the involvement of the inferomedial side of the optic nerve, which is not directly visualized by an ipsilateral approach and thus requires optic nerve mobilization.
   METHODS: Between 2003 and 2017, 21 consecutive pa-its were operated on using this approach. The surgical technique is described and the visual outcomes, resection and recurrence rates, and complications are analyzed.
   RESULTS: Twenty patients were included, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years. Regarding visual outcomes, among the 19 patients who had a visual impairment before surgery, 14 (74%) improved, 2 were stabilized (10%), and 2 (10%) showed a worsening of the most-compromised optic nerve and 1 (5%) of the less-compromised optic nerve Gross total resection was achieved in 18 patients (90%) and 1 patient experienced recurrence 10 years after the initial surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: This approach allowed lower mobilization of the compromised optic nerve, better preservation of the vascularization of the visual pathways, and direct access to the inferomedial side of the optic nerve.

ID SPINAL DEFORMITIES; SCOLIOSIS
AB BACKGROUND: Three-column spinal osteotomies were developed to address severe and stiff kyphoscoliosis. However, the optimal choice of osteotomy in these patients is still unclear. This retrospective study aims to compare the outcomes and complications between grade 4 and grade 5 osteotomies in patients with severe and stiff thoracic kyphoscoliosis.
   METHODS: Forty-five patients with severe and stiff thoracic kyphoscoliosis who underwent 3-column osteotomy in the thoracic spine were classified into 2 groups according to the grade of osteotomy. The clinical data and radiologic parameters were collected and compared.
   RESULTS: Fourteen patients received grade 4 osteotomy, and 31 patients received grade 5 osteotomy. The spinal column shortening distances were similar between groups. The postoperative and latest follow-up radiologic parameters were not statistically significant between groups. Postoperative and follow-up results demonstrated greater correction of the regional kyphosis angle in the grade 4 osteotomy group, but did not reach significant level. The operative time and blood loss of grade 5 osteotomies were greater than those of grade 4, but showed no significant differences. Perioperative complication rates were also similar between groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Similar clinical outcomes can be achieved with grade 4 and grade 5 spinal osteotomies. This may enrich the basis on moving down to a lower osteotomy grade when treating patients with severe and rigid thoracic kyphoscoliosis.

   METHODS: This is a cross-sectional retrospective study of 229 patients with TBI who were admitted to the Neurosurgery Unit at Dr. Hasan Sadikin Hospital, Bandung, from July to December 2016.
   RESULTS: During the study period, 495 patients with TBI were admitted; 229 patients were included in the study. Several variables were analyzed using independent statistical methods before being included in the online CRASH calculator, including Glasgow Coma Scale score (P = 0.000), pupillary reaction to light (P = 0.000), major extracranial injury (P = 0.002), and interval following incidence (P = 0.000). Statistical analysis showed that the online CRASH prognostic model reliably predicted 14-day mortality rate (P = 0.000) with 91.6% sensitivity and 95.1% specificity.
   CONCLUSIONS: The online CRASH model is a good prognostic model that can be used for patients with TBI in many developing countries.

AB BACKGROUND: Odontoid fracture is the most common lesion of the cervical spine in persons age >70 years. Management of these fractures has become a public health issue. In this study, we evaluated bone fusion, early complications, and mortality in a cohort of patients age >75 years who underwent surgical management of odontoid fracture using the Harms technique.
   METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of 57 patients treated surgically between 2002 and 2016 in a single spine surgery institution. Age at diagnosis, comorbidities, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score were analyzed. At a 6-month follow-up, bone healing was evaluated with computed tomography scans.
   RESULTS: The mean patient age was 85.5 1 6.6 years, and 53% of the patients had an ASA score >= 3. According to the Anderson classification, 70% of the patients had a type 2 odontoid fracture. The average duration of follow-up was 15.7 months. Ten patients were lost to follow-up. The rate of early complications was 19%, with no mechanical complications reported. At a 6-month follow-up, a solid bony union was seen in all patients. The 1-year mortality was 14%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgical management of odontoid fractures in elderly patients using the Harms technique is associated with an excellent rate of bone healing with acceptable rates of early complications and mortality.

AB BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet therapy is common and complicates operative management of acute intracranial hemorrhage. Few data exist to guide antiplatelet reversal strategies.
   METHODS: An online survey detailing antiplatelet reversal strategies in patients presenting with acute operative intracranial hemorrhage (subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, and intracerebral hemorrhage) was distributed to board-certified neurosurgeons in North America.
   RESULTS: From 2782 functional e-mail addresses, there were 493 (17.7%) responses to question 1 and 429 (15.4%) completed surveys. Most respondents chose to perform no additional laboratory testing before surgical intervention, regardless of hemorrhage type. The most common antiplatelet reversal strategy in the presence of aspirin was platelet transfusion (subdural hematoma and intracerebral hemorrhage) or no intervention (epidural hematoma). The most common antiplatelet reversal strategy in the presence of an adenosine diphosphate antagonist or dual antiplatelet therapy was platelet transfusion or platelet transfusion with desmopressin acetate administration. There was a statistically significant difference in management strategy depending on the antiplatelet therapy (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: When patients on antiplatelet medication present with operative intracranial hemorrhage, the majority of neurosurgeons do not perform qualitative platelet testing. Antiplatelet reversal strategies are significantly influenced by the antiplatelet therapy with more aggressive reversal strategies employed in the presence of ADP antagonists.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the optimal moment to perform tracheostomy in a patient requiring anterior cervical fixation.
   METHODS: A retrospective observational study conducted over an 18-year period included 56 patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit with acute spinal cord injury and underwent tracheostomy and surgical fixation. The sample was divided into 2 groups: at-risk group (31 patients who had undergone tracheostomy before cervical surgery or <4 days after surgery) and not-at-risk group (25 patients who had undergone tracheostomy >4 days after fixation surgery). Descriptive and comparative studies were carried out. Overall trend of the collected data was analyzed using cubic splines (graphic methods).
   RESULTS: The only infectious complications diagnosed as related to the surgical procedure were infection of the surgical wound in 2 patients in the not-at-risk group (12%) and deep tissue infection in 1 patient in the at-risk group (3.2%). During the study period, we identified a tendency toward performance of early tracheostomies.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the presence of a tracheostomy stoma before or immediately after surgery is associated with a low risk of infection of the cervical surgical wound in instrumented spinal fusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze the quantitative relationship between suprasellar extension (SSE) and visual function impairment in Chinese patients with nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma (NFPA) with optic chiasm compression.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 117 patients with NFPA and optic chiasm compression treated at our hospital between January 2013 and December 2016. The quantitative relationships between SSE detected on sagittal and coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sections and visual function, including visual acuity (VA) and visual fields (VFs), were analyzed. The cutoff value of SSE to predict a VF defect (VFD) was calculated using a receiver operating characteristic curve. The mean deviation (MD) value was used to quantitatively analyze the VFs, and multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate risk factors of VFD.
   RESULTS: Among 117 patients with NFPA, 77 (65.8%) had VFD, and the mean VA was 0.42 +/- 0.38 logMAR. The cutoff value of the sagittal SSE was 14.0 mm, with 77.9% sensitivity and 80.0% specificity, and the cutoff value of the coronal SSE was 15.8 mm, with 81.8% sensitivity and 85.0% specificity. The values of SSE on 2 MRI sections were correlated with VA (P < 0.001) and the MD (P < 0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that SSE on sagittal views (P < 0.001), SSE on coronal views (P < 0.001), duration of the disease (P = 0.027), and apoplexy (P = 0.036) were related to the degree of VF damage.
   CONCLUSIONS: VFD in patients with NFPA with chiasm compression can be predicted by SSE on MRI. There is a linear correlation between SSE and the MD value.

AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric posterior circulation aneurysms are rare, complex, poorly understood lesions on which only limited literature is currently available. We report our 12-year experience of managing this condition to enhance knowledge of this rare entity.
   METHODS: Patients <18 years old with posterior circulation aneurysms managed at our institution from January 2005 to April 2017 were included. Demographic, clinical, radiologic and management details were retrieved from hospital records and characteristics of the aneurysms and treatment were analyzed.
   RESULTS: During this period, 20 pediatric patients (maleto-female ratio 15:6; mean age, 13.1 years) with posterior circulation aneurysms were treated. Most of the patients (75%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most common location was the vertebrobasilar junction and vertebral artery (31.81%) followed by the basilar artery and the posterior cerebral artery (27.72% each). Dissecting (81.8%) and large (63.63%) aneurysms were the most common types noted. Of the15 patients with 22 aneurysms treated, 13 underwent endovascular management (parent vessel sacrifice in 8 aneurysms and parent vessel preservation in 5 aneurysms), 1 patient underwent surgery, and 1 patient received medical management for central nervous system tuberculosis. During follow-up, 1 patient had recurrence of aneurysm, and 1 patient died after discharge from the hospital. Overall good outcome was recorded in 90% of patients (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4-5).
   CONCLUSIONS: Vertebrobasilar junction and vertebral artery was the most common location for posterior circulation aneurysms and most were dissecting aneurysms. Endovascular treatment was the mainstay of management. Overall good outcome was observed at long-term follow-up.

AB BACKGROUND: Tile incidence of brain metastases is rising. To our knowledge, no published study focuses exclusively on brain metastases larger than 4 cm. We present our surgical outcomes for patients with brain metastases larger than 4 cm.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of inpatient data at our institution from January 2006 to September 2015. Primary end points included overall survival, progression-free survival, and local recurrence rate.
   RESULTS: Sixty-one patients had a total of 67 brain metastases larger than 4 cm: 52 were supratentorial and 15 were infratentorial. Forty-three patients underwent surgical resection. Average duration of disease freedom after resection was 4.79 months (range, 0-30 months). Excluding patients with residual on immediate postoperative magnetic resonance imaging, the average rate of local recurrence was 7 months (range, 1-14 months). Overall survival after surgery excluding patients who chose palliation in the immediate postoperative period averaged 8.76 months (range, 1-37 months). Thirty-five of 43 patients (81.4%) had stable or improved neurologic examinations post-operatively. Six patients (13.95%) developed surgical complications. There were 3 major complications (6.98%): 2 pseudomeningoceles required intervention and 1 postoperative hematoma required external ventricular drain placement. There were 3 minor complications (6.98%): 1 self-limited pseudomeningocele, 1 subgaleal fluid collection, and 1 postoperative seizure.
   CONCLUSIONS: Surgery resulted in stable or improved neurologic examination in 81.4% of cases. On statistical analysis, significantly increased overall survival was noted in patients undergoing surgical resection, and those with higher Karnofsky Performance Scale and lower number of brain metastases at presentation. There is a need for further studies to evaluate management of brain metastases larger than 4 cm.

   NONINFECTIOUS FEVER; CRITICAL-CARE; SEPSIS; DIAGNOSIS; PROTEIN
AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether procalcitonin (PCT) levels are different in infected versus noninfected febrile patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
   METHODS: This prospective observational study included 104 patients with ICH and fever >38.3 degrees C admitted to the intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. PCT was measured on day 1 (PCT 1) of fever and 48-72 hours later (PCT 2). Patients were determined to have an infection (pneumonia, urinary tract infection, or bacteremia) based on cultures, imaging, and clinical impression of treating clinicians.
   RESULTS: Analysis of variance indicated significant mean differences in patients with no, probable, and definite infection (F-2(,)103 = 3.12, P = 0.048) between PCT 1 and PCT 2 (F-2(,)72 = 4.64, P = 0.013). Patients with probable infection had the highest PCT 1 (mean = 0.47, SD = 0.93), and patients with definite infection had higher PCT 2 (mean = 0.62, SD = 0.85). Additional analyses of univariable mean differences showed mean PCT 1 that was significantly higher in the probable infection group compared with the no infection group. Mean PCT was significantly higher at both time points in the definite infection group compared with the no infection group. There were no significant differences between the probable and definite infection groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: PCT levels were higher in patients with ICH and infections and may be a useful marker to differentiate between infectious and noninfectious etiologies of fevers in these patients. Further studies, including randomized controlled trials, will help in establishing the utility of this marker in optimal management of febrile patients with ICH.

AB BACKGROUND: Morphometric analysis or examination of symptoms in patients with Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) with various associations does not suffice for evaluation of surgical outcome of these patients. We assessed the relationship of morphologic changes in brain and spinal cord and disease symptoms with changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamic parameters in patients with CM-I.
   METHODS: The study included 41 patients in 3 groups of CM-I, CM-I/occipitoatlantoaxial joint instability, and CM-I/tethered cord syndrome and 18 normal subjects. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging and computational fluid dynamics analysis were done for all samples.
   RESULTS: Maximum CSF velocities and pressures in patients had an increase of 17.1%-23.2% and 41.5%-56.8%, respectively, compared with normal subjects. The data dispersion of maximum CSF velocity was >3.1 times that of the maximum pressure. Results showed that maximum CSF pressure is a more appropriate hydrodynamic parameter than maximum CSF velocity for assessing the condition of patients. Results also showed that CSF and PCF volumes had declined 57% and 11.3%, respectively, in CM-I. These declines were greater in CM-I than in the other 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Maximum CSF pressure regardless of the group the patients belonged to was similar in patients with symptoms of similar intensity. The correlation between maximum CSF pressure with CSF and PCF volumes decreased secondary to the disease. PCF volume was more favorable than CSF volume for assessing intensity of disease symptoms. Furthermore, in a constant pressure change, sensitivity of PCF volume in CM-I/occipitoatlantoaxial joint instability and CM-I/tethered cord syndrome groups was more than in the CM-I group.

AB BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical brain tumor removal poses a unique threat for patients while also minimizing instrumental control. Thus, psychological processes used by patients to cope with surgery-related anxiety are of utmost importance. This is the first study to assess both nature and effectiveness of surgery-related coping efforts in neuro-oncological patients.
   METHODS: We included 70 inpatients with an intracranial tumor before neurosurgical treatment. For assessment of patients' coping efforts, we used the Coping with Surgical Stress Scale, which includes the 5 subscales: Rumination, Optimism and Trust, Turning to Social and Religious Resources, Threat Avoidance, and Information Seeking. The extent of operation-specific anxiety was assessed via the State-Trait-Operational-Anxiety Inventory. Effectiveness of coping efforts was assessed via relations to other areas of psychosocial well-being (e.g., depression or health-related quality of life).
   RESULTS: All patients reported using a variety of coping strategies, most frequently from the area of Optimism and Trust, which was associated with less surgery-related anxiety and better emotional well-being. By contrast, Rumination was positively correlated with surgery-related anxiety and psychiatric morbidity. Mediator analyses supported a model in which surgery-related anxiety initiates coping efforts, which then distinctively mediates the influence of patients' anxiety on psychosocial well-being.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neuro-oncologic patients undertake considerable psychological effort to cope with surgery- related anxiety. The majority of patients use coping strategies facilitating emotional adjustment. A minority of patients, however, report extensive rumination, which negatively influences psychosocial well-being. Our results stress the importance of the doctor-patient relationship and offer implications for targeted interventions.

AB INTRODUCTION: Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) is a well-known hindbrain disorder in which the cerebellar tonsils protrude through the foramen magnum. The soft tissues, including the transverse ligament and the tectorial membrane at the retro-odontoid space, can compress the cervicomedullary junction if they become hypertrophic.
   METHODS: Twenty-two symptomatic patients with CM-I (aged 5-19 years) were treated between 2007 and 2017 at our institute. The retro-odontoid soft tissue was evaluated using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Anteroposterior (AP) distances and craniocaudal distances of the soft tissue were measured in patients with CM-I and 48 normal control children. Modified clivoaxial angles were also evaluated as the index of ventral compression of the cervicomedullary junction.
   RESULTS: Of the 18 patients treated with foramen magnum decompression, 16 patients improved postoperatively, whereas the condition of 2 remained unchanged. The AP distances in the CM-I group (6.0 mm) were significantly larger than those in the control group (3.5 mm), whereas there were no apparent differences in the craniocaudal distances. Modified clivoaxial angles were obviously smaller in the CM-I group (131.5 degrees) than in the control group (146.9 degrees). Moreover, the AP distances were significantly reduced postoperatively (5.5 mm), although the other parameters did not change significantly.
   CONCLUSIONS: The retro-odontoid soft tissue in symptomatic patients with CM-I can be hypertrophic enough to compress the cervicomedullary junction ventrally even if there are no combined osseous anomalies. Foramen magnum decompression works to reduce the hypertrophic changes significantly, suggesting that downward tonsil movement might participate in hypertrophic soft tissue formation at the retro-odontoid space.

AB BACKGROUND: The minimally invasive lateral transpsoas approach allows retroperitoneal access for discectomy and graft placement. However, the procedure has rarely been used for the treatment of septic spondylodiscitis. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the clinical and radiographic outcomes from this minimally invasive procedure for septic spondylodiscitis.
   METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients (17 males and 14 females) were included in this study from July 2013 to January 2016. Clinical outcomes were assessed by Oswestry Disability Index, visual analog scale, modified Macnab criteria, and inflammatory parameters. Radiographic results were analyzed by studying the changes in diseased disc height, lordosis, and fusion status.
   RESULTS: The Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale score improved by 58% and 69% at the last follow-up. The modified Macnab criteria were found to be excellent in 21 patients (68%) and good in 10 (32%). Inflammatory parameters normalized over the average 24 months follow-up. There were no major complications that might have influenced the outcomes in this cohort. A complete fusion after 12 months was achieved in 87% of patients. A mean 7.5 mm restoration in disc height and 6.4 restoration in lumbar lordosis were observed in all patients, whereas an average 4.5 mm loss in restored height resulting from graft subsidence was observed in 24 patients during the follow-up. However, graft subsidence did not influence clinical outcomes significantly.
   CONCLUSIONS: A minimally invasive lateral transpsoas approach in combination with instrumentation provides a novel treatment for patients with septic spondylodiscitis without severe kyphosis and neurologic impairment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate feasibility and safety of transvenous embolization for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).
   METHODS: Between November 2016 and August 2017, a transvenous endovascular embolization protocol was implemented at the Henan Provincial People's Hospital for consecutive patients with ruptured brain AVMs. Therapeutic decision making was based on Spetzler-Martin grade, brain AVM location, pattern of venous drainage, and angioarchitecture. Transvenous embolization was combined with transarterial support. Complete angiographic obliteration of the nidus was the objective of treatment.
   RESULTS: Among 10 patients with ruptured brain AVMs, 8 were male. Spetzler-Martin grades before transvenous embolization were IV in 3 patients, III in 5 patients, II in 1 patient, and I in 1 patient. Modified Rankin Scale score before the procedure was 0-2 for 6 of 10 patients. Five patients also had deep venous drainage. Arterial blood pressure control and venous pressure cooker technique were used in all 10 patients; 9 patients had immediate angiographic occlusion. Two patients had a ventricular hemorrhage, which did not cause any disability after medical treatment. Seven patients underwent angiography 3-5 months after the procedure, and complete obliteration of the nidus was confirmed. Median clinical follow-up for all 10 patients was 8 months (range, 3-12 months). Epilepsy occurred in 1 patient 3 months after the procedure, and modified Rankin Scale scores for all patients were <= 1.
   CONCLUSIONS: Transvenous embolization of brain AVMs is feasible and may improve cure rates. The safety and long-term effects need further validation.

AB BACKGROUND: Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines reflect evidence-based best practices in management of traumatic brain injury. The aim of this study was to examine self-reported physician compliance and predictors of compliance related to BTF guidelines.
   METHODS: We conducted an international, multidisciplinary survey examining self-reported adherence to BTF guidelines and multiple factors potentially affecting adherence. We also surveyed intracranial pressure monitoring practices.
   RESULTS: Of 154 physician respondents, 15.9% reported their institutions "always" follow BTF guidelines and 72.2% reported that they follow them "most of the time." Personal volume of traumatic brain injury cases and years in practice were not significantly related to adherence. Reported adherence varied significantly in association with respondent's institutional trauma level (P = 0.0010): 17.3% of practitioners at level I, 13.0% at level II, and 0% at level III trauma centers reported "always" following guidelines. Reported adherence to guidelines also varied significantly in association with provider specialty (P = 0.015) and institutional volume of severe traumatic brain injury cases (P = 0.008). Regarding intracranial pressure monitoring practices, 52% of respondents used external ventricular drains, 21% used intra-parenchymal monitors, and 27% had no preference {P< 0.001). Of respondents not routinely using external ventricular drains, 36% claimed to "always" follow guidelines. There was no apparent association between type of intracranial pressure monitoring used and reported guideline adherence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Few respondents reported their institutions "always" follow BTF guidelines. General surgeons and providers at high-volume level I trauma centers were more likely to comply with guidelines. Differences in survey responses based on provider and institutional characteristics may help target educational efforts.

AB BACKGROUND: The standard treatment for Kummell disease with neurologic deficit remains controversial. Traditional posterior long-segment fixation (LSF) has been widely used, but the procedure results in significant trauma and carries the risk of multiple complications. Therefore, bone cement-augmented short-segment fixation (BCASSF) has been recommended for this condition.
   METHODS: The study included 36 patients treated with LSF or BCASSF between January 2012 and June 2015. The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score, anterior height of fractured vertebrae, kyphotic Cobb angle, and neurologic function by the Frankel classification were evaluated and compared, and duration of operation, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complications were recorded.
   RESULTS: Significant differences were observed in the VAS, ODI, anterior height of affected vertebrae, and kyphotic Cobb angle between preoperatively and 7 days postoperatively and between preoperatively and at the final follow-up, whereas no significant differences were observed between 7 days postoperatively and at final follow-up. No significant differences in the aforementioned parameters were observed between the groups at 7 days postoperatively and at the final follow-up. Neurologic function was improved in both groups; however, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups either preoperatively or postoperatively. Blood loss and length of hospital stay were significantly lower in the BCASSF group compared with the LSF group, but no significant between-group differences were observed in operation time and complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Lower blood loss and shorter hospital stay were associated with BCASSF compared with LSF; the 2 techniques had similar clinical outcomes and radiographic findings. Therefore, we recommend BCASSF for treating patients with Kummell disease with neurologic deficits.

AB INTRODUCTION: No study has volumetrically examined resection degree and recurrence in pituitary macroadenoma (PMA). We analyzed the impact of volumetric tumor resection on prediction of tumor recurrence and retreatment in a cohort of patients with nonfunctioning PMA >= 2 cm.
   METHODS: Records were reviewed from 1998-2008 for patients with null cell or nonsecreting PMA >= 2 cm. Inclusion criteria were surgically resected PMA and years' follow-up or recurrence before >= 4 years. Seventy-eight patients were found. PMA tissue volume preoperatively and postoperatively was quantified by a board-certified neuroradiologist. Extent of resection (EOR) was calculated. The primary end point was tumor recurrence with a secondary end point of treated tumor recurrence.
   RESULT: Median age was 58 (20-85). Forty-one (53%) had no tumor recurrence at a median of 113 (48-203) months. Thirty-seven (47%) patients had tumor recurrence with a median time of 55 (9-176) months. On univariate analysis, increasing age, decreasing preoperative and postoperative volumes, and increasing EOR were statistically significant for decreasing the risk of recurrence or treated recurrence. On multivariate analysis, only age and EOR remained significant. Receiver operating characteristic showed EOR <86% was associated with PMA regrowth. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference for recurrence comparing groups by EOR >= 86% or <85%.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found younger age and increasing EOR are significant predictors of tumor regrowth and retreatment. These results indicate EOR assessment may have a role in large PMA. Further study with volumetric analysis is needed in a larger cohort of patients.

AB BACKGROUND: Lumbar herniated disc is a "preference-sensitive" condition, in which the optimal treatment choice is crucially dependent on an informed patient's goals and values. Little is known about decisional conflict, defined as an individual's level of uncertainty regarding a decision, in patients considering treatment for lumbar herniated discs. Our work aims to identify factors associated with decisional conflict and areas for improved shared decision making.
   METHODS: We prospectively surveyed patients seeking treatment for a lumbar herniated disc at L4-L5 and/or L5-S1 with a physician at the UCLA Spine Center. Decisional conflict was measured using the validated SURE questionnaire. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic analysis to identify predictors of decisional conflict.
   RESULTS: Among the 174 participants surveyed, 47% reported experiencing decisional conflict and 44% changed their treatment preference after the visit, with 61% of these opting for more invasive treatment. Participants with decisional conflict were less satisfied with their treatment decision (P < 0.001) and less willing to recommend their physician (P = 0.003) and physician's medical group to others (P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis revealed that participants were more likely to experience decisional conflict if they consulted with a physiatrist compared with a surgeon (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; P = 0.019) and if they did not feel able to discuss the various treatment options with the doctor during the visit (OR, 8.5; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Many patients with a lumbar herniated disc experience decisional conflict when choosing a treatment option. Our results highlight the need to implement tools and strategies to improve decisional quality, such as decision aids before consultation.

AB OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the anatomy of the superior cluneal nerves more proximal to the posterior layer of the thoracolumbar fascia.
   METHODS: Twelve sides of 6 fresh-frozen cadavers were used. The age at death ranged from 54 to 88 years After a transverse skin incision 10 mm above the iliac crest, the superior cluneal nerves were detected by blunt dissection and traced back to the dorsal root ganglia. The diameter of the nerves from L1 to L3 was measured. Also, the relationship to the erector spinae muscle and dorsal ramus was recorded.
   RESULTS: The mean diameters of the origin of the L1, L2, and L3 were 1.71 +/- 0.29 mm, 1.73 +/- 0.40 mm, and 1.52 +/- 0.55 mm, respectively. On 7 sides (58.3%) for L1, seven sides (58.3%) for L2, and 10 sides (83.3%) for L3, the nerves pierced the iliocostalis muscle. One side (8.3%) for L2 and one (8.3%) for L3 had no cutaneous branch.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study could help to elucidate the anatomy of the superior cluneal nerves and help avoid complications during surgical approaches to the lumbar spine.

AB BACKGROUND: In a developing country there is a need for development of criteria that can be used for the diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis, which is common in that region.
   METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and radiologic features of spinal tuberculosis and spinal epidural tumors have been compared statistically, and inferences have been drawn in terms of P values, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive values.
   RESULTS: A statistically significant relationship was found between spinal tuberculosis and spinal pain, fever, gradually progressive lower limb weakness, contrast-enhancing epidural +/- paravertebral lesions, continuous levels affected, spinal deformity, and raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
   CONCLUSIONS: These relationships were considered the most probable criteria for the diagnosis of spinal tuberculosis.

AB OBJECTIVE: Risk factors for rebleeding after revascularization surgery are unclear. We aimed to evaluate long-term outcomes after combined revascularization surgery for adult hemorrhagic moyamoya disease (MMD) and identify risk factors for initial and recurrent hemorrhage.
   METHODS: A total of 105 adult patients with hemorrhagic MMD from January 2007 to May 2011 were prospectively enrolled in this study. All patients underwent combined revascularization surgery on unilateral hemorrhagic hemispheres and were observed for at least 5 years.
   RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 77 months, 12 patients were lost to follow-up. Twelve of the remaining 93 patients developed rebleeding, and 6 patients died. According to rebleeding sites, ipsilateral and contralateral rebleeding occurred in 6 and 6 patients, respectively. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups (P > 0.05). The annual risks of overall, ipsilateral, and contralateral rebleeding were 1.1%, 0.62%, and 0.51%, respectively. A significant correlation was observed between improvement of anterior choroidal artery-posterior communicating artery dilation or extension in the operated hemispheres and low risk of ipsilateral rebleeding (P < 0.05). Progression of Suzuki stage in the nonhemorrhagic hemispheres was significantly associated with contralateral rebleeding (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Combined revascularization surgery may help prevent ipsilateral rebleeding in adult patients with hemorrhagic MMD by improvement of anterior choroidal artery-posterior communicating artery dilation and extension in the operated hemisphere. Progression of Suzuki stage in the nonhemorrhagic hemispheres was a strong predictor of subsequent contralateral rebleeding.

   Outcome; Subdural hematoma
ID CARDIAC-ARREST
AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate relationship between gray-white matter ratio (GWR) on computed tomography and prognosis in patients with extra-axial hematoma.
   METHODS: Patients with extra-axial hematoma who had undergone surgical treatment at Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital from September 2016 to December 2017 were included. GWR values were calculated by measuring values of gray matter and white matter in Hounsfield units in noninjury sites of basal ganglia. According to Glasgow Outcome Scale score at 3 months after operation, patients were divided into good prognosis (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 4-5) and poor prognosis (Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1-3) groups.
   RESULTS: Of 103 patients who met inclusion criteria and were analyzed, 24 had with a poor outcome, including 5 deaths, and 79 patients had a good outcome. There were significant differences between the 2 groups in terms of age, type of hematoma, admission Glasgow Coma Scale score, and presence of hernia (all P < 0.05). Postoperative HU values of posterior capsule, postoperative GWR values, and difference between preoperative and postoperative GWR values had statistical significance (all P < 0.05). Receiver operating characteristic curve showed that difference between preoperative and postoperative GWR values was the best predictor of poor outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS: The difference between preoperative or postoperative GWR values has a higher sensitivity and greater area under the curve to predict patient outcome. Measuring the difference between preoperative and postoperative GWR values may be useful as an objective early predictor of outcome in patients with extra-axial hematoma. Larger samples and multicenter prospective studies are still required.

AB OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the clinical course and significance of postoperative subdural fluid collection (SFC) and identified the patients who were at risk of developing postoperative chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) after the clipping of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs).
   METHODS: Between January 2012 and June 2014, we retrospectively reviewed 298 patients with UIAs treated by microsurgical clipping. Among them, 257 patients were enrolled in the present study. Subdural lesions (SDLs) were defined as SFC at 1-month follow-up computed tomography (CT) and a CSDH at any time within 1 month after the clipping of UIAs. We examined the volume changes, Hounsfield unit (HU) values, and the end results of SFC in serial CT scans.
   RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative CSDH that needed burr hole surgery was 2.5%. Changes in SFC volume that occurred within 1 week of surgery were a risk factor for the occurrence of SDL at the 1-month follow-up CT (odds ratio 34.039; P < 0.001). The corrected average HU value of SCF (cut-off value: 11.9, with a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 73.7%) on postoperative day 7 was an independent risk factor for development of a CSDH at the 1-month follow-up CT (odds ratio 19.261; P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: SDLs seen during 1-month follow-up may be associated with the occurrence of increased SFC volume within a week after the clipping of UIAs. The corrected average HU value of the SFC on postoperative day 7 was the only risk factor for the development of CSDHs at 1-month follow-up CT.

AB BACKGROUND: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsy. Focal cortical dysplasia is the most common dual pathology found in association with the hippocampal sclerosis. In this study, the effect of dual pathology on freedom from seizure was sought in patients with TLE.
   METHODS: This study performed a retrospective analysis of patients with TLE who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2017. Histopathologic analysis was performed on patients with and without dual pathology in the temporal neocortex. Seizure outcomes were compared.
   RESULTS: A total of 54 patients with TLE were included. The rate of overall favorable seizure outcome was found to be 96.3%. In 53.7%, dual pathology was present in the temporal cortices in addition to the hippocampal sclerosis. Patients without dual pathology showed significantly greater freedom from seizure (P = 0.02).
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients without dual pathology had a significantly higher seizure-free rate after anterior temporal resection than patients with dual pathology. Resection of the temporal cortex in addition to mesial temporal structures seems to be reasonable for better seizure outcome.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal adhesive arachnoiditis (SAA) is an inflammatory process of the meninges. Cystic changes and cicatrization may lead to neurologic deficits and immobilization. Therapy is difficult and often unsatisfactory. We describe 8 cases of extensive SAA after extradural spinal infection.
   METHODS: A total of 238 patients with epidural abscess or osteomyelitis were treated at our institution between 2011 and 2018. We identified 8 patients who developed extensive SAA on follow-up. Different forms of the disease, radiologic changes, and potential treatment options are described.
   RESULTS: Eight patients developed extensive SAA after either spontaneous epidural infection in 4 cases (50%) or after surgery or steroid injection (50%). Initial treatment for epidural infection was surgery without dural injury in 87.5%. One patient was treated conservatively. SAA was diagnosed 1 month to 8 years after the initial infection, not only in the index region but throughout the whole spine, with varying clinical symptoms. Treatment options such as corticosteroids (n = 4), thecaloscopy (n = 1), syringesubarachnoid shunting (n = 1), and focal or multilevel arachnolysis (n = 5) were applied. In 2 patients (25%), a rare complication of internal malabsorptive hydrocephalus had to he treated. Patients showed diverse outcomes at last follow-up (mean, 37 months).
   CONCLUSIONS: The prognosis for extensive SAA is poor. Surgical interventions may improve radiologic findings and clinical presentation at least temporarily. Even extradural infection can lead to severe SAA. Early surgery with local reduction of the epidural infection might reduce the risk of inflammation passing the dural sac and causing SAA.

AB BACKGROUND: Various diseases of the spine are treated by immobilization via orthoses, although detailed evidence on the efficiency of orthotic bracing remains elusive. The present study sought to investigate the impact of 3 different orthoses on spinal immobilization using 3-dimensional (3D) kinematic measurements.
   METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers performed different motion tasks, including trunk flexion/extension and bilateral trunk bending. Movements were performed under 4 different conditions: 1) without orthosis, 2) while wearing a 3-point hyperextension brace (HB), 3) while wearing a custom-made semirigid orthosis (SO), and 4) while wearing a custom-made rigid orthosis (RO). Spinal motion was analyzed using a 3D optical motion capture system assessing regional, intersegmental, and segmental range of motion (ROM).
   RESULTS: Assessment of spinal motion was successfully accomplished in all subjects. Overall, orthoses significantly reduced spinal motion compared with no bracing. RO caused the greatest restriction of regional, intersegmental, and segmental spinal motion among all orthoses. For flexion/extension, the mean percentage decreases between T3 and L5 in full active ROM with HB, SO, and RO compared with no orthosis were 38%/30%, 48%/47%, and 51%/55%, respectively (P <= 0.05). Lateral bending was impaired by 28%, 44%, and 70%, respectively (P <= 0.05). Assessment of lateral bending revealed greater immobilization by SO and RO compared with HB (P <= 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: The present 3D kinematic system allows for precise assessment of spinal motion. Custommade orthoses cause superior restriction on gross spinal motion compared "off-the-shelf" orthoses. If orthotic bracing is indicated, design, comfort, and patient compliance need to be carefully considered to guarantee successful therapy.

   PRESSURE RECORDINGS; PEDIATRIC-PATIENTS; SURGICAL-TREATMENT; BRAIN-STEM
AB OBJECTIVE: Type 1 Chiari malformation (CM-I) is a craniospinal disorder historically defined by cerebellar tonsillar position greater than 3-5 mm below the foramen magnum (FM). This definition has come under question because quantitative measurements of cerebellar herniation do not always correspond with symptom severity. Researchers have proposed several additional radiographic diagnostic criteria based on dynamic motion of fluids and/or tissues. The present study objective was to determine if cardiac-related craniocaudal spinal cord tissue displacement is an accurate indicator of the presence of CM-I and if tissue displacement is altered with decompression.
   METHODS: A cohort of 20 symptomatic patients underwent decompression surgery. Fifteen healthy volunteers were recruited for comparison with the CM-I group. Axial phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (PC-MRI) measurements were collected before and after surgery at the FM with cranial-caudal velocity encoding and 20 frames per cardiac cycle with retrospective reconstruction. Spinal cord motion (SCM) at the FM was quantified based on the peak-to-peak integral of average spinal cord velocity.
   RESULTS: Tissue motion for the presurgical group was significantly greater than controls (P = 0.0009). Motion decreased after surgery (P = 0.058) with an effect size of -0.151 mm and a standard error of 0.066 mm. Postoperatively, no statistical difference from controls in bulk displacement at the FM was found (P = 0.200) after post hoc testing using the Tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons.
   CONCLUSIONS: These results support SCM measurement by PC-MRI as a possible noninvasive radiographic diagnostic for CM-I. Dynamic measurement of SCM provides unique diagnostic information about CM-I alongside static quantification of tonsillar position and other intracranial morphometrics.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess outcome of residual brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) after stereotactic radiosurgery.
   METHODS: Patients with residual BAVM 3 years after radiosurgery were retrospectively included. Demographics, angioarchitectural characteristics, complications, bleeding, and cure rates of patients with intervention or conservative management (i.e., observation) were compared. We analyzed characteristics of patients treated conservatively who achieved cure or still had persistent BAVMs during follow-up.
   RESULTS: The study included 87 patients including 5 patients with subtotal obliteration with a mean follow-up time of 33.7 +/- 36.6 months. Of patients, 27 (31.0%) received subsequent treatment (radiosurgery, n = 23; microsurgery, n = 3; embolization, n = 1), and 60 (69%) were treated conservatively. After repeat SRS, 4 (14.8%) patients experienced symptomatic complications after the second treatment, and 7 (25.9%) experienced asymptomatic changes. Three (3.4%) patients, all of whom presented initially with a ruptured BAVM, experienced hemorrhage during follow-up. Subsequent treatment was effective with a complete cure of BAVM in 11 patients (40.7%). Complete resolution of the residual BAVM occurred in 15 (25%) patients treated conservatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Complete obliteration of a significant number of residual BAVMs may occur 3-5 years after the first irradiation, whereas increased radiation dose associated with repeat SRS may lead to an increased risk of complications. The fact that the interval risk of bleeding decreased after SRS (especially for ruptured BAVM) lends further strength to the argument for a conservative management approach for residual BAVM 3-5 years after the first irradiation.

AB BACKGROUND: Scalp arteriovenous malformations, also known as cirsoid aneurysms, are rare lesions that are congenital, traumatic, or postinfectious in nature. These lesions may be found incidentally or owing to signs and symptoms that they produce, such as an enlarging pulsatile mass, headache, tinnitus, or bleeding. These lesions often constitute high-flow arterial blood from the superficial temporal or occipital arteries with venous outflow into extracranial venous structures.
   METHODS: We describe diagnosis and management of 2 cases of congenital scalp arteriovenous malformations in adolescent patients. One case had more typical vascular supply and outflow, whereas the other case demonstrated more uncommon arterial blood supply from extracranial ophthalmic arteries as well as a component of transosseous venous drainage into the intracranial superior sagittal sinus via emissary veins.
   RESULTS: Treatment of these lesions usually consists of endovascular embolization followed by surgical resection.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both scalp AVMs described were successfully excised after transvenous embolization. Consideration of risks of intracranial venous drainage must be taken into account when evaluating AVM anatomy.

AB OBJECTIVE:To investigate the changes of Apo-J and Omi/HtrA2 protein expression in rats with intracerebral hemorrhage.
   METHODS: 150 Sprague-Dawley adult rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: (1) normal control (NC) group, (2) sham group, and (3) intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) group. The data were collected at 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 5 days, and 7 days. Apoptosis was measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated-dUTP nick-end labeling staining. The distributions of the Apo-J and Omi/HtrA2 proteins were determined by immunohistochemical staining. The levels of Apo-J mRNA and Omi/HtrA2 mRNA expressions were examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
   RESULTS: Apoptosis in the ICH group was higher than in the sham and NC groups (P < 0.05). Both the Apo-J and Omi/HtrA2 expression levels were increased in the peripheral region of hemorrhage, with a peak at 3 days. The Apo-J mRNA level positively correlated with the HtrA2 mRNA level in the ICH group (r = 0.883, P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: The expressions of Apo-J and Omi/HtrA2 increased in parallel in the peripheral region of rat cerebral hemorrhage. Local high expression of Apo-J in the peripheral regions may play a neuroprotective role by inhibiting apoptosis via the Omi/HtrA2 pathway after hemorrhage.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a new technique in brainstem surgery, neuronavigation (NN)-guided corticospinal tract (CST) mapping, in a retrospective study of patients undergoing brainstem tumor surgery.
   METHODS: We studied 40 patients with a brainstem tumor who were enrolled in this study. Patients whose worst preoperative muscle strength of the 4 limbs was greater than 3 levels from normal on the Lovett scale were divided into 2 groups: a treatment group of 21 patients who underwent NN-guided CST mapping and routine intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring (IONM) and a control group of 19 patients who underwent routine NN and IONM . Preoperative muscle strength and postoperative (day 90 postsurgery) muscle strength were assessed and compared between the 2 groups.
   RESULTS: In the NN-guided CST mapping group, 3 patients (14.3%) had a decrease in muscle strength by 1 level postoperatively, and no patient experienced a decrease of >1 level. In the control group, 4 patients (21.1%) had a 1-level decrease in muscle strength, and 5 (26.3%) had a decrease of >1 level. Patients in the NN-guided CST mapping group had significantly better surgical outcomes compared with those in the control group (P = 0.018, Fisher exact test).
   CONCLUSIONS: Brainstem tumor resection using NN-guided CST mapping achieved better preservation of motor function compared with routine NN and IONM. NN-guided CST mapping not only decreased the difficulty of the surgery, but also significantly improved the efficiency of surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: Neurosurgical techniques for the treatment of seller pathologies have been evolving continuously over recent decades. In addition to the innovation of approaches and surgical techniques, this progress yielded to the application of modern operative technologies. The introduction of high-definition (HD) cameras for endoscopic systems has shown good results in endonasal pituitary surgery. The aim of this study was to assess endoscopic HD image quality in comparison with microscopic visualization.
   METHODS: All pituitary surgeries were performed via an endonasal approach in the endoscopic technique. For each comparison, pituitary gland tissue was predefined intraoperatively. A resident was randomly required to identify this tissue either using HD endoscopic or microscopic visualization through the endonasal approach. Subjective image quality was requested with a questionnaire. Furthermore, the illuminance level of the endoscope and microscope was measured in the seller region in an experimental setup.
   RESULTS: Thirty-five procedures were performed and included in this comparison. Of the 35 procedures, 74% of gland tissue cases were identified correctly under endoscopic visualization, whereas it was identified correctly under microscopic visualization in 8% (P < 0.05). There was no significant correlation of experience and intraoperative results in cases of the microscopic (r = - 0.15) or endoscopic visualization (r = 0.22). The identification of tissue in the depth of the surgical field via endoscopic HD visualization was thought to be superior to the microscope in 86.8%. Both modalities were assessed equal in 10.4%. Microscopic visualization was rated superior in 2.8% of all cases. There was a significant superiority of endoscopic visualization (P < 0.05). The mean lux level for endoscopic visualization of the seller region was 221,000. The mean lux level decreased significantly by 66% to 241,000 lx with 350 mm distance and by 60% to 141,000 lx with 450-mm distance because of the positioning of the microscope in front of the head form to visualize the surgical field at the seller region.
   CONCLUSIONS: HD endoscopic visualization accounted for significantly more reliable identifications of pituitary gland tissue in comparison with the microscope in the presented setting. The subjective impression of image quality is better with HD endoscopes. The goal of further studies should be to identify if these findings would also result in improved surgical outcome in short-term and longterm follow-up.

AB OBJECTIVE: Although classical hemifacial spasm (HFS) has been attributed to an atraumatic pulsatile vascular compression around the root exit zone (REZ) of the facial nerve, rare tumor-related HFS associated with meningiomas, epidermoid tumors, lipomas, and schwannomas in the cerebellopontine angle have been reported. The exact mechanism and the necessity of microvascular decompression for tumor-induced HFS is not clear, especially for vestibular schwannomas.
   METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 10 patients with vestibular schwannomas out of 5218 cases of hemifacial spasm between 2004 and 2014.
   RESULTS: Hemifacial spasm occurred ipsilateral to the vestibular schwannoma in 9 patients and contralateral to the lesion in 1 patient. The mean follow-up period was 86 months (range, 22-140 months). All patients underwent surgery for resection of the vestibular schwannoma. Following the principle of neurovascular compression, offending vessels were found in 7 patients, no offending vessels in 2 patients, and a tumor with the displacement of brain stem contributing to contralateral facial nerve compression in 1 patient. HFS was relieved immediately postoperatively in 9 patients, whereas it improved gradually and then resolved after one month in one patient with a contralateral vestibular schwannoma.
   CONCLUSIONS: For HFS induced by vestibular schwannomas in our study, the majority of cases are caused by a combination of tumor and vascular co-compression at the REZ. Surgical intervention resulted in resolution of symptoms. For HFS with ipsilateral vestibular schwannoma, exploration of the facial nerve root for vascular compression should be performed routinely after tumor resection. It is critical to check that no vessel is contact with the entire nerve root.

AB BACKGROUND: This study aimed to identify prognostic factors for functional outcome of metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC).
   METHODS: All full texts in English regarding the prognostic factors for functional outcome of MSCC, published between January 2007 and October 2017, were identified using the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. An exploratory meta-analysis was also conducted when appropriate data were available.
   RESULTS: A total of 25 studies, involving 4897 patients, met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 69.7% of patients across all studies were able to walk postoperatively compared with 49.0% preoperatively. Moreover, 84.7% of the patients maintained ambulation after treatment. Motor function was significantly associated with ambulatory status before treatment, time of developing motor deficits, interval from symptom to surgery, and preoperative performance status.
   CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory status before treatment, interval from symptom to treatment, and time of developing motor deficits can be considered as the most significant prognostic factors for posttreatment ambulatory status. Spinal metastasis should have a higher priority, and immediate intervention should be started before the development of irreversible neurologic deficits. Moreover, short-course radiotherapy might be a good option for patients with a limited life span. Consequently, the identified prognostic factors can be regarded as a preoperative assessment tool to predict neurologic outcome and guide clinical treatment for individual patients with MSCC. However, the retrospective nature of this study with low-quality evidence must be taken into account when interpreting these results, and further research is needed to identify prognostic factors.

AB BACKGROUND: Grade III Spetzler-Martin brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a specific set of AVMs with high variability in terms of site, size, angioarchitecture, flow dynamics, and involvement of eloquent areas. Surgery preceded by preoperative embolization has been reported as a useful treatment option for these lesions. The aim of this study is to report outcomes and personal experience of combined preoperative Onyx embolization and surgical resection on a consecutive series of grade III brain AVMs.
   METHODS: Between 2005 and 2017, 27 grade III AVMs were treated by means of a staged Onyx embolization and subsequent surgical treatment. Site and size of the AVMs, embolization, and surgical specifics as well as complications and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: All AVMs were supratentorial, 13 of which were hemorrhagic. Mean nidal volume was 19.5 mL. Average embolization sessions were 1.6. Mean embolization-related obliteration rate and morbidity were 28.8% and 3.7%, respectively. Surgery was performed within 3.7 days on average. In our experience, Onyx embolization made the nidus excision easier, facilitated the hemostasis, and contributed to the early identification of the lesion in cases of small or racemose nidus. The surgical obliteration rate was 92.6%. A good overall outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2) was achieved in 70.4% of patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, preoperative Onyx embolization helped the surgical management of grade III Spetzler-Martin brain AVMs. Careful evaluation of the angioarchitecture, a tailored strategy in the embolization process, and full cooperation within the neurosurgical-neuroendovascular team are mandatory.

AB BACKGROUND: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) -urs due to chronic degenerative changes in the cervical spine causing compression of the spinal cord. CSM has been studied for decades, and numerous articles have been published on the topic. We sought to identify the top 50 most-cited articles on CSM.
   METHODS: The top 50 most-cited articles were retrieved frme the Scopus database using the search criteria "cervical spondylosis with myelopathy" OR "cervical spondylotic myelopathy." Levels of evidence were also calculated and descriptive and statistical analyses were carried out.
   RESULTS: The total number of citations of the top 50 mostcited papers was 7072. The paper with the highest number of citations had 287. All articles were published between 1966 and 2010, with most published between 1990 and 1999 (n = 22). The most prolific country in terms of the total number of publications was United States, with 25 publications, followed by Japan. The majority of the articles were level IV.
   CONCLUSIONS: There is a deficiency of high-level articles in the top 50 most-cited list. This study provides an important overview of historical development of treatment methods, as well as publication trends related to this pathology. Regardless, this comprehensive list of the top 50 most-cited articles can serve as a resource for future trainees and surgeons to draw on to build their knowledge base.

AB BACKGROUND: The lesionectomy is a general surgical procedure for treating focal epilepsy resulting from a structural abnormality, but a favorable outcome cannot be achieved in some patients, especially patients whose symptomatogenic zone is located in remote regions. Herein we propose the surgical disconnection of the seizure propagation pathway, which consists of short and long associating fibers linking the epileptogenic zone to the remote symptomatogenic zone, as an effective method of achieving favorable seizure outcomes in patients with posterior cortex epilepsy.
   METHODS: Three patients with intractable epilepsy showing a structural abnormality in the medial posterior cortex participated in this study. Their habitual seizures were complex partial seizures stemming from remote symptomatogenic zones. Seizure propagation-related fibers were assumed by non-invasive examination and semiology.
   RESULTS: Cingulum and superior/inferior longitudinal fasciculus were considered to form main seizure propagation pathway. Based on the preoperative assumption and the intraoperative intracranial electroencephalogram findings, a lesionectomy and corticectomy were performed for 2 patients while a clusterectomy and corticectomy were performed for the remaining patient. The resection area was extended in the direction of the association fibers to disconnect the remote symptomatogenic zone completely from the epileptogenic zone. Engel class I was achieved in all the patients.
   CONCLUSION: The current study suggested that assuming the presence of association fibers was an important factor for achieving a favorable outcome in the surgical treatment of posterior cortex epilepsy. Though further study is required, disconnection surgery is recommended as a treatment option for cases in which the epileptogenic zone is located in an eloquent area.

DE Endoscopic surgery; Intracerebral hemorrhage; Intraoperative bleeding;
   Recurrent hemorrhage; Spot sign
ID HEMATOMA EXPANSION; EXTRAVASATION; CONTRAST; RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Endoscopic evacuation of hematoma (EEH) has recently been applied to treat patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). Intraoperative active bleeding (IAB), which is occasionally observed in EEH, might lead to greater blood loss, further brain damage, and more postoperative recurrent hemorrhage. However, no definite predictor of IAB has been established. Because the spot sign is associated with other hemorrhagic complications, we aimed to evaluate whether it predicts IAB.
   METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the incidence and risk factors of IAB, including the spot sign, in 127 sICH patients who underwent EEH within 6 hours after computed tomography angiography at our institution between June 2009 and December 2017.
   RESULTS: The study included 53 women and 74 men with an average age of 66.7 +/- 11.8 years. IAB occurred in 40 (31.5%) of the 127 patients, and it was more frequent in patients with the spot sign than in patients without it (14/24 [58.3%] vs. 26/103 [25.2%]; P = 0.003). Multivariable regression analyses suggested that the spot sign was an independent predictor of IAB (odds ratio [OR], 3.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-8.30; P = 0.03). In addition, earlier surgery gradually increased the risk of IAB, and surgery within 4 hours of onset was an independent risk factor (OR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.12-16.9; P = 0.03, referring to postonset 8 hours or more).
   CONCLUSIONS: The spot sign and early surgery were independent predictors of IAB in EEH for sICH. In patients with sICH and spot sign, complete treatment of IAB by electrocoagulation might be important for minimizing surgical complications.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients with diagnoses of high-grade carotid stenosis are often placed on antiplatelet therapy and undergo carotid endarterectomy (CEA) during their hospital stay. There is intersurgeon variability in offering CEA to patients specifically on the potent antiplatelet agent clopidogrel.
   METHODS: Utilizing the Premier database, data from adults with principal discharge diagnosis of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or carotid artery stenosis or occlusion without stroke/TIA (CAS) who had a CEA during the same hospital stay in 2014 were analyzed. Recent clopidogrel or aspirin use was defined as within 3 days before CEA. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine the association of age, race, gender, symptomatic versus asymptomatic carotid stenosis, academic versus non-academic center, and regions of the United States with recent antiplatelet use before CEA.
   RESULTS: There were 15,381 patients (median age, 71 years, interquartile range 65-78; 42% females) with stroke, TIA, or CAS who had a CEA during the same hospital stay in 2014 within the Premier databse. Of these, 2570 patients (16.7%) received clopidogrel, 4992 (32.5%) received aspirin but no clopidogrel, and 7819 (50.8%) received no clopidogrel/aspirin immediately before CEA. Younger patient age, treatment at a non-academic center, symptomatic carotid stenosis, and being in the Northeast or South were associated higher odds of being on clopidogrel therapy prior to CEA.
   CONCLUSIONS: Across the United States, 1 in 6 patients was on clopidogrel therapy prior to undergoing a CEA. Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were most likely to be on clopidogrel therapy prior to their CEA. Future systematic analysis of differences in outcomes and safety events are needed.

   ANEURYSMS; FREQUENCY; SIGNS
AB OBJECTIVE: Although ruptured vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms (VADAs) are often associated with ocular symptoms, such as abducent nerve palsy and Terson syndrome (TS), their frequency and risk factors in comparison with those associated with ruptured aneurysms in other locations have not been reported.
   METHODS: Three hundred forty-three patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage were treated in our hospital from April 2002 to May 2016, among which 35 (10.2%) had VADA as the origin of hemorrhage. They were analyzed retrospectively for risk factors of ocular symptoms.
   RESULTS: Of the 343 patients, 26 had eye movement disturbance (7.6%) and 22 had TS (6.4%). Both eye movement disturbance (14 patients; 40.0%; P < 0.0001) and TS (10 patients; 28.6%; P < 0.0001) occurred more frequently in the VADA than the non-VADA group. Abducent nerve palsy accounted for all eye movement disturbances associated with ruptured VADA, although it occurred in 6 of 12 affected patients with ruptured aneurysms in other locations. Of these patients, 4 improved within 3 months (28.6%) and 8 did so within 1 year (66.7%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that ruptured VADA is a risk factor for both eye movement disturbance and TS (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0033; 95% confidence interval of odds ratio: 3.41-29.5 and 1.72-14.33, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Eye movement disturbance and TS occurs more frequently in patients with ruptured VADA than with aneurysms in other locations. Early evaluation by an ophthalmologist is recommended in these patients.

   RELEVANCE
AB OBJECTIVE: Moyamoya vasculopathy (MMV) is characterized by progressive stenosis of the intracranial arteries. MMV currently has no curative treatments, and cerebral ischemia and hemorrhage are the major outcomes. Evaluation of the stroke risk of each patient resulting from the progression of intracranial arterial stenosis is clinically important.
   METHODS: We prospectively reviewed patients with intracranial arterial stenosis and already diagnosed MMV. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging using contrast agent is the novel vessel wall imaging (VWI) technique for directly evaluating vascular walls and intracranial artery disease. All patients underwent high-resolution vessel wall imaging and magnetic resonance angiography at the time of registration, and they underwent follow-up magnetic resonance angiography. The Fisher exact test was used to assess associations between the degrees of wall enhancement and between stable and progressive intracranial arterial stenosis.
   RESULTS: A total of 24 patients (17 female; mean age, 36.1 +/- 16.8 years; range 3-67 years) with MMV were consecutively recruited to this study. Progression of stenosis was shown in 6 lesions (66.6%) on strong enhancement, 2 lesions (12.5%) on mild enhancement, and 1 lesion (4.3%) on lack of enhancement. Arterial vessel wall enhancement in MMV patients correlated closely with progression of intracranial arterial stenosis (P = 0.002).
   CONCLUSIONS: Arterial vessel wall enhancement in MMV patients was closely related to progression of intracranial arterial stenosis. Strong enhancement of the intracranial vessel wall was associated with intracranial arterial stenosis progression, and lack of enhancement correlated with the stability of intracranial arterial stenosis.

AB BACKGROUND: Risk factors for surgical revision remain important because of additional readmission, anesthesia, and morbidity for the patient and significant cost for health care systems. Although the rate of reoperation (RRO) is well described for traditional open posterior (OP) approaches, the RRO in minimally invasive lateral (MIL) surgery remains poorly characterized. This study compares the RRO in patients undergoing decompressive lumbar spine surgery via MIL versus OP approaches.
   METHODS: Patient demographics and comorbidities were retrospectively collected for 2060 patients undergoing single-stage elective lumbar spinal surgery at multiple institutions. A subset of 1484 patients had long-term data (long-term cohort [LT cohort]). The RRO was compared between approaches through univariate and multivariate analysis.
   RESULTS: There were 1292 patients (62.7%) who underwent lateral access surgery, whereas 768 patients (37.3%) underwent OP surgery. The MIL cohort was significantly older, had a higher proportion of men, and had more comorbidities than the OP cohort. In the LT cohort, lateral patients were significantly older and had more comorbidities, with a lower body mass index and a lower proportion of men and smokers. Surgical complications between the groups trended to be similar. The MIL cohort had a significantly lower RRO at both 30 days (approximately 57% lower, MIL cohort: 1.01% vs. OP cohort: 2.36%, P = 0.02) and 2 years (approximately 61% lower, MIL cohort: 2.09% vs. OP cohort: 5.37%, P < 0.01) after surgery. On multivariate analysis, surgical approach was the only significant predictor for the RRO at both 30 days (open posterior approach odds ratio [OR], 4.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33-15.09; P = 0.02) and 2 years (open posterior approach OR, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.26-8.42; P = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that MIL surgical approaches, compared with OP approaches, have a significantly lower RRO after lumbar spine surgery.

ID VASCULAR-SURGERY GUIDELINES; ARTERY; ANGIOGRAPHY; SOCIETY; DISEASE;
   SKULL; BASE
AB BACKGROUND: Vascular and osteological parameters, such as the heights of the carotid bifurcation and distal end of the plaque, are important preoperative considerations for patients undergoing carotid stenosis procedures, such as carotid endarterectomy. However, for patients with contraindications to contrast media, such as allergies or nephropathies, 3-dimensional computed tomography angiography (3D-CTA) is unavailable, and preoperative evaluation remains challenging. In the present study, we aimed to develop a preoperative simulation for use in patients with contrast-contraindicated carotid stenosis.
   METHODS: Images from noncontrast neck computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging obtained without the Leksell stereotactic frame were uploaded to GammaPlan. Following delineation of various structures, preoperative simulations were performed to determine the relationships between vascular and osteological structures. We applied this technique in 10 patients with carotid stenosis to verify the accuracy of the simulation.
   RESULTS: In all patients, the GammaPlan simulation successfully visualized the heights of the carotid bifurcation and distal end of the plaque without the use of contrast medium. Furthermore, information regarding the location of internal arterial structures, such as calcifications and unstable plaques, could be incorporated into GammaPlan images. We verified simulation accuracy by comparing the simulation results with 3D-CTA and operative findings.
   CONCLUSIONS: Simulations created using GammaPlan can be used to obtain accurate vascular and osteological information regarding the heights of the carotid bifurcation and distal end of the plaque, without the use of contrast medium. The reconstruction of delineated structures using this technique may be effective for preoperative evaluation in patients with contrast-contraindicated carotid stenosis.

ID HEMIFACIAL SPASM; TRIGEMINAL NEURALGIA; TEFLON GRANULOMA; COLLAGEN;
   SERIES
AB BACKGROUND: Vessel transposition is the standard procedure in microvascular decompression (MVD), which necessitates more complex and difficult surgical techniques, including suturing in the deep operative field. We recently reported the usefulness of TachoSil tissue sealing sheets soaked with fibrin glue for vessel transposition in MVD, known as the "birdlime" technique. Here we describe various technical variations and improved adhesive strength of this material for safe and optimal vessel transposition without complications.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the operative findings of 31 consecutive patients who underwent MVD with the transposition procedure using TachoSil tissue sealing sheet soaked with fibrin glue between January 2012 and June 2017. The adhesive strength of TachoSil soaked with fibrin glue was measured using porcine dura mater.
   RESULTS: A single piece of this material was required in 13 patients, a single piece for multiple lesions was required in 5 patients, multiple pieces for a long segment were required in 12 patients, mainly with the offending vertebral artery in 9 patients, stacked pieces in 2 patients, and direct adhesion of vessels in 6 patients. All patients except 1 had total remission of symptoms immediately after the procedure. There were no severecomplications, recurrences, adhesions, or cranial nerve dysfunction in any patient. TachoSil soaked with fibrin glue showed significantly higher adhesive tensile strength compared with fibrin glue or Teflon felt with fibrin glue.
   CONCLUSIONS: Modifications of the birdlime technique and reinforcement of the adhesive strength provide an easy and adjustable way to perform MVD safely and effectively to reduce the risk of intraoperative neurovascular injury.

AB BACKGROUND: Basilar invagination can result from systemic diseases that can weaken structural integrity of the craniocervical junction. Definitive treatment often requires ventral decompression and posterior decompression and fusion. Endonasal odontoidectomy is a relatively new minimal access procedure; quality of life (QOL) after this procedure has not been reported.
   METHODS: We reviewed a consecutive database of endonasal odontoidectomy cases and identified patients having posterior decompression and fusion. Two QOL questionnaires were administered postoperatively: Sino-Nasal Outcome Test and 36-Item Short Form Survey. Comparisons with other endonasal or Chiari procedures were performed.
   RESULTS: The study comprised 14 patients; 79% had Chiari malformation in addition to basilar invagination. Mean follow-up was 17.2 months. Symptomatic improvement occurred in 78.6% after surgery. Average postoperative Sino-Nasal Outcome Test scores were 39.2 +/- 17.93, with worst scores in areas related to fatigue and sleep patterns but not nasal function. 36-Item Short Form Survey scores were lower in areas of physical function and general health but better for emotional health and pain. Compared with patients undergoing Chiari malformation surgery without endonasal odontoid resection or fusion, patients undergoing odontoidectomy had higher QOL in areas of role emotional, emotional well-being, and pain but worse QOL in general health and role physical.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing posterior decompression and fusion with endonasal odontoidectomy do well after surgery with respect to nasal function and emotional health. Patients who also have severe basilar invagination associated with systemic diseases demonstrate reduced QOL after surgery in areas of physical function and sleep leading to fatigue, irritability, and concentration difficulty, likely related to their systemic disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze the long-term outcome of Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKS) for symptomatic brainstem cavernous malformation (s-BSCM).
   METHODS: Forty-five patients (14 males, 31 females) were treated with GKS for s-BSCM from January 1998 to December 2011. All patients were followed up for >5 years, and their clinical data were analyzed retrospectively. All patients had a history of symptomatic bleeding once or more before GKS. These hemorrhages caused neurologic deficits including cranial nerve deficits, hemiparesis, hemisensory deficits, spasticity, or chorea. The mean target volume of s-BSCM was 1.82 cm(3), and the median prescribed marginal dose of radiation was 13 Gy. The mean clinical and imaging follow-up period was 9.31 years (range 5.1-19.4 years).
   RESULTS: The 45 patients had 69 hemorrhagic events before GKS. During the follow-up period after GKS, 35 patients had no hemorrhagic event, 6 patients had 1 episode of symptomatic hemorrhage, and 4 patients had 2 episodes. The calculated annual hemorrhage rate was 40.06% at pre-GKS, 3.3% at 2 years after GKS, 1.48% at 5 years after GKS, and 4.64% at >5 years after GKS. In this study of 45 patients, symptomatic radiation-induced complications developed in only 1 patient (2.2%). No patients had died at the last follow-up.
   CONCLUSIONS: GKS for s-BSCM is a safe and effective alternative to surgical resection for reducing the rate of recurrent hemorrhage. Because the annual hemorrhage rate increases >5 years after GKS, clinicians should monitor patients closely to determine their subsequent treatment.

AB BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) has become a popular method of interbody fusion. Clinical outcomes after single-level MIS-TLIF have been reported, but few studies have focused on the radiologic changes in the segmental parameters of the operated and adjacent segments and in lumbar lordosis.
   METHODS: From March 2009 to September 2016, 117 patients who underwent a single-level MIS-TLIF surgery for lumbar degenerative disease were enrolled in this retrospective study. The anterior disc height (ADH), posterior disc height (PDH), and segmental angle (SA) of the operated and adjacent levels and lumbar lordosis (LL) were evaluated on radiographs obtained pre- and postoperatively at 6- to 12-month follow-up visits. Cage-related parameters including fusion and subsidence rates were analyzed on postoperative computed tomography scans. Clinical assessment used validated outcome scores such as the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire and the Odom criteria.
   RESULTS: ADH and PDH of the operated segment increased significantly after surgery, but no significant changes were seen in the SA of that level. Statistically significant decreases were observed in the PDH of both adjacent segments and increases in the adjacent superior SA. LL showed a slight but statistically significant improvement after surgery that was mostly correlated with a postoperative increase in the adjacent superior SA (r = 0.58; P< 0.001). No significant correlations were found between clinical and radiologic results.
   CONCLUSIONS: Single-level MIS-TLIF increased disc height but not the SA at the operated level. LL improvement after surgery was mainly associated with the increase of the cranial segmental angle.

AB BACKGROUND: Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) of the posterior fossa are demanding lesions that often present with rupture. Studies including outcome analyses in surgically operated patients with ruptured infratentorial AVMs are scarce. Certain anatomic and demographic features have shown associations with postoperative outcomes.
   METHODS: Eighty-six patients with infratentorial AVM were collected from our AVM database. Fifty-four patients were admitted from 1990 onward, and their demographic, lesion, and treatment characteristics were analyzed. The cohort was further refined to 38 consecutive patients with surgically treated ruptured infratentorial AVM admitted to our center between 1990 and 2014, and statistical analyses of factors influencing outcomes were conducted.
   RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (69%) had a favorable outcome at early follow-up and 24 (67%) had a favorable outcome at final follow-up. Factors associated with poor outcome in early recovery on univariate analyses were deep venous drainage of the lesion (odds ratio (OR 5.3; P = 0.037) and high Hunt & Hess score (P = 0.003). In the multivariate model, independent predictors for poor outcome were deep venous drainage (OR, 14.5; P = 0.010) and older age at admission (OR, 1.06; P = 0.028). The sole independent predictor for poor outcome at last follow-up was deep venous drainage (OR, 5.00; P = 0.046). The total follow-up time was 370 person-years.
   CONCLUSIONS: AVMs of the posterior fossa usually present with rupture and thus require prompt clinical treatment. The majority of surgically treated patients recover favorably. Our data show that venous drainage patterns have the greatest influence on the patient's postoperative condition. Other influencing factors include the severity of hemorrhage and patient age at admission.

AB OBJECTIVE: Preoperative embolization may facilitate skull base meningioma resection, but its safety and efficacy in the Onyx era have not been investigated. In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the outcomes of preoperative embolization of skull base meningiomas using Onyx as the primary embolysate.
   METHODS: We queried an endovascular database for patients with skull base meningiomas who underwent preoperative embolization at our institution in 2007-2017. Patient, tumor, procedure, and outcome data were analyzed.
   RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (28 meningiomas) underwent successful preoperative meningioma embolization. The mean patient age +/- SD was 56 +/- 13 years, and 18 patients (64%) were women. The mean tumor size was 49 cm 3 . There were 1, 2, or 3 arterial pedicles embolized in 21 cases (75%), 6 cases (21%), and 1 case (4%), respectively. The embolized pedicles included branches of the middle meningeal artery in 19 cases (68%), the internal maxillary artery in 8 cases (29%), the ascending pharyngeal artery in 2 cases (7%), and the posterior auricular, ophthalmic, occipital, and anterior cerebral arteries in 1 case each (4%). The embolysates used were Onyx alone in 20 cases (71%), n-butyl cyanoacrylate alone in 3 cases (11%), coils/particles and Onyx/n-butyl cyanoacrylate in 2 cases each (7%), and Onyx and coils in 1 case (4%). The median degree of tumor devascularization was 60%. Significant neurologic morbidity occurred in 1 patient (4%) who developed symptomatic peritumoral edema after Onyx embolization.
   CONCLUSIONS: For appropriately selected skull base meningiomas supplied by dura mater-based arterial pedicles without distal cranial nerve supply, preoperative embolization with current embolysate technology affords substantial tumor devascularization with a low complication rate.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy and safety of freehand pedicle screw placement in surgical correction for thoracolumbar kyphosis caused by ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 266 consecutive patients with AS who underwent osteotomy for kyphosis correction with freehand screw insertion from January 1998 to April 2015 at our institution. A total of 2314 pedicle screws in 158 patients with AS with postoperative computed tomography scans were included in the study. Postoperative computed tomography was performed to classify accuracy of screws, using the established Gertbein classification (grade 0: no perforation, grade 1: perforation <2 mm, grade 2: perforation between 2 and 4 mm, and grade 3: perforation >4 mm). Patients were divided into 2 groups according to coronal Cobb angle: group A (n = 21, Cobb angle >= 10 degrees), group B (n = 137, Cobb angle <10 degrees).
   RESULTS: Among the 2314 pedicle screws, 2168 pedicle screw placements were categorized as grade 0, 71 were grade 1, 51 were grade 2, and 24 were grade 3. Breaches occurred more frequently in L1-S1 than the thoracic spine (7.1% and 5.4`)/0, respectively). T5 (25.0%) and S1 (17.7%) experienced the greatest breach rate, whereas 18, 11, and L3 had the lowest breach rate. The breach rate of group A was greater than that of group B (7.9% vs. 6.1%). None of the breaches resulted in either neurologic deficits or vascular complications.
   CONCLUSIONS: Freehand pedicle screw placement can be performed safely with acceptable breach rate in patients with AS and thoracolumbar kyphosis.

AB INTRODUCTION: Actinomycosis is an uncommon chronic suppurative infection that rarely affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is caused by filamentous Grampositive anaerobic bacteria that is a normal commensal but causes suppurative and granulomatous inflammation after disruption of anatomical barriers. We report the largest series of 17 histologically confirmed cases of CNS actinomycosis and review clinical, imaging, and histopathologic features.
   METHODS: An histologically confirmed cases of CNS actinomycosis diagnosed between January 2010 and June 2016 were retrieved from the neuropathology records. The demographic profile, clinical, radiologic, microbiologic, and histologic features, treatment, and clinical outcomes were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Seventeen cases were histopathologically diagnosed to have CNS actinomycosis. Nine of these were primarily admitted and managed in our institute, whereas the remaining 8 were referred to us for histopathologic diagnosis. Mean age at presentation was 31.4 years, with male predilection (3.25:1). Mean duration of symptoms was 2.95 months. Systemic symptoms were noted in 5 patients, although no systemic focus was detectable. Pachymeningitis was most common type (9; 52.94%), and chronic abscess was identified in 7. History of previous surgery for osteomyelitis was forthcoming in 3. All patients underwent surgical excision/aspiration of the lesions. Histologically, lesions revealed characteristic suppurative granulomatous response with giant cells and actinomycotic colonies were detected within necrotic centers. Cultures failed to grow Actinomyces in all. Follow-up data were available in 9 patients managed in our institute, and all had good outcomes at the median follow-up period of 32 months after antibiotic treatment for mean period of 8.4weeks.
   CONCLUSIONS: Histopathology remains the cornerstone for diagnosis of actinomycosis as on culture confirmation is very rare.

AB BACKGROUND: Stereotactic laser ablation (SLA), also termed laser interstitial thermal therapy, is a minimally invasive procedure that is increasingly used in neurosurgery. We wished to examine how and whether SLA is changing the landscape of treatment options for neurosurgical patients.
   METHODS: Patients undergoing stereotactic laser ablation were prospectively enrolled in the Laser Ablation of Abnormal Neurological Tissue (LAANTERN) registry. Data from the first 100 enrolled patients are presented here.
   RESULTS: Clinical indications for SLA include treatment of primary intracranial tumors (48%; 81% being high-grade gliomas [HGGs]), brain metastases (BMs, 34%), epilepsy (16%), and other (2%). For HGGs, SLA was equally likely used for newly diagnosed (45%) or previously treated/recurrent lesions (55%, P = 0.54). By contrast, SLA was predominantly used as treatment for BMs in which radiation therapy/radiosurgery had failed (91%), with only 9% of SLAs performed as initial treatment for newly diagnosed lesions (P < 0.001). Of all SLAs performed, 45% of the procedures were in lieu of surgical resection, with 43% performed because the lesion was not accessible by conventional neurosurgical techniques.
   CONCLUSION: HGGs and BMs ara the leading indications for SLA in the LAANTERN study. For HGGs, SLA is equally used in the presenting or previously treated/recurrent setting. For BMs, SLA is typically used in the recurrent setting. SLAs are equally likely to be performed for difficult-to-access lesions or in lieu of conventional open surgery.

TI May the Inferior Petrosal Sinus Recanalization During Endovascular

   MANAGEMENT; EMPHASIS
AB BACKGROUND: Sixth nerve palsy is a common complication of endovascular treatment for carotid-cavernous fistulas (CCF). Two hypotheses are evoked: the spontaneous venous congestion into the cavernous sinus and the direct compression of the nerve by the embolic agent into the cavernous sinus. Nevertheless, the evidence is still uncertain. Knowing the vicinity of the sixth nerve with the inferior petrosal sinus (IPS) in the Dorello canal, we hypothesized that the recanalization of the IPS increased the risk of nerve damage.
   METHODS: We analyzed a prospective database of patients treated for CCFs from March 2009 to April 2016. We excluded patients who did not need treatment, cases of high-flow CCF, and patients lost to follow-up, obtaining a homogeneous population of 82 patients with indirect CCFs. This population was divided in 2 groups: patients without new-onset/worsening of sixth nerve palsy and patients with this postprocedural complication.
   RESULTS: Our main endpoints were the potential differences between patients with or without recanalization of IPS and between those who underwent or not an embolization with Onyx-18. We did not find any statistically meaningful difference between the 2 groups concerning the necessity of IPS recanalization (P > 0.999, odds ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.32-2.96) or with the use of Onyx-18 as an embolic agent (P = 0.56; odds ratio 1.41, 95% confidence interval 0.41-2.45).
   CONCLUSIONS: The recanalization of a thrombosed IPS does not increase the risk of procedural sixth nerve damage. The initial injury seems to relate with development/worsening of a sixth nerve palsy.

AB BACKGROUND: Measurements of quantitative blood flow are crucial during brain vascular surgery. Indocyanine green video angiography (ICG-VAG) is an accepted method of blood flow visualization; however, quantitative techniques have not yet been established. Thus, the aim of this study was to further develop ICG analysis for visualizing intraoperative flow changes.
   METHODS: We conducted basic experiments and clinical investigations to establish a relationship between ICG-VAG and measured blood flow. We evaluated several parameters and identified optimal indicators that precisely reflect blood (or fluid) flow. Both in vitro and in vivo studies were performed to calculate the interval between baseline and the intensity peak (Grad) and to measure actual flow rate.
   RESULTS: Grad and actual flow rate showed good exponential correlation, with R-2 values of 0.90 in vitro and 0.82 in vivo. In a representative patient (case 3), we performed intraoperative flow analysis using Flowlnsight, which identified a marked elevation in Grad on the brain surface. Because this observation is predictive of brain hyperperfusion, we used these data to carefully manage blood pressure postoperatively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Grad is the optimum parameter for estimating flow conditions. Although ICG-VAG provides only visual profiles of blood circulation in the brain, this procedure has the potential to be widely used in clinical situations. ICG-based flow measurement can be used to identify normal and abnormal blood flow conditions, such as graft flow and vascular pathology. The novelty of this technique is that the fluorescence intensity of Grad enables surgeons to quantitatively measure real blood flow.

TI Shape of the Spinal Canal Is Not Associated with Success Rates of
   Microsurgical Unilateral Laminotomy and Bilateral Decompression for
   Lumbar Spinal Canal Stenosis
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Laminotomy; Lumbar decompression; Spinal canal shape; Spinal canal
   stenosis
AB BACKGROUND: Anatomic shape of the spinal canal (oval, round, trefoil) has been reported to predict outcome of bilateral decompression performed in an undercutting technique via unilateral laminotomy in monosegmental lumbar spinal stenosis, with poorest results observed in a trefoil spinal canal, leading to the proposal of using bilateral instead of unilateral laminotomy. The aim of this study was to assess whether this anatomic classification into oval, round, and trefoil shapes is relevant to surgical treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.
   METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients undergoing lumbar decompression surgery was performed. Spinal canal configuration was assessed on preoperative computed tomography based on maximal transverse and anteroposterior diameter, and shapes were classified into oval, round, and trefoil. Associations between spinal canal shape and outcome improvement (aggregate of walking distance and leg pain) were tested.
   RESULTS: Decompression of 236 lumbar levels was performed in 159 patients (mean age, 73 +/- 8 years; mean body mass index, 29 +/- 6). Average number of operated segments was 1.3 a 0.6. Oval configurations were detected in 155 (65%) levels, round configurations were detected in 11 (5%) levels, and trefoil configurations were detected in 70 (30%) levels. Postoperative improvement was recorded in 91.7% of patients. Spinal canal shape had no influence on surgical outcome (oval, area under the curve 0.529, P = 0.672; trefoil, area under the curve 0.500, P = 0.997; round, area under the curve 0.471, P = 0.670).
   CONCLUSIONS: Spinal canal configuration varies in frequency with lumbar segment. Our results do not support the idea that this anatomic classification, particularly the nomenclature of oval, round, and trefoil, should influence surgical decision making.

   DATA; MORTALITY; SURGERY; VERTEBROPLASTY; MORBIDITY; OUTCOMES; SPINE
AB BACKGROUND: Vertebral compression fractures are the most common spine injury seen in elderly patients. Vertebral augmentation is considered a safe and effective treatment. The ability to predict outcomes based on comorbidities is lacking. The modified frailty index has been used to predict complications after orthopedic and surgical procedures. We hypothesized that despite a low rate of adverse outcomes, postoperative complications after kyphoplasty would be greater in patients who are frail.
   METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for patients who underwent kyphoplasty between 2006 and 2015. Complication data including 30-day complications, life-threatening complications, reoperation and readmission rate, and length of stay data was recorded, and 5-item modified frailty index (5i-mFl) scores were calculated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were then conducted to analyze frailty as a predictor of postoperative complications after kyphoplasty.
   RESULTS: In total, 2465 patients were identified (mean age = 73.98). As 5i-mFl increased from 0 to >= 2 the rate of overall complications increased nearly 3-fold from 3.7% to 10.4% (P< 0.001) and the rate of life-threatening complications increased from 0.8% to 2.4% (P = 0.042). In addition, 30-day readmission increased from 8.9% to 12.9% (P = 0.005), adverse hospital discharge increased from 7.6% to 25.6% (P< 0.001), and length of stay increased from 1.66 days to 3.75 days (P < 0.001). Frailty was associated with increased total complications, Clavien-Dindo IV complications, length of stay, and 30-day readmission rates.
   CONCLUSIONS: The 5i-mFl is a straightforward assessment tool that correlates with outcomes after kyphoplasty. It can be used to help clinicians predict adverse events and facilitate informed discussions with their patients.

TI Safety of Running Two Rooms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of
   Overlapping Neurosurgical Procedures
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Review
DE Outcomes; Overlapping surgery; Safety; Systematic review
ID PATIENT OUTCOMES; UNITED-STATES; SURGERY; CONCURRENT; SHORTAGE
AB OBJECTIVE: Overlapping surgery, a long-standing practice within academic neurosurgery centers nationwide, has recently come under scrutiny from the government and media as potentially harmful to patients. Therefore, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the safety of overlapping neurosurgical procedures.
   METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A review of PubMed and Medline databases was undertaken with the search phrase "overlapping surgery AND neurosurgery AND outcomes." Data regarding patient demographics, type of neurosurgical procedure, outcomes, and complications were extracted from each study. The principle summary measure was odds ratio (OR) of the association of overlapping versus non-overlapping surgery with outcomes.
   RESULTS: The literature search yielded a total of 36 studies, of which 5 studies met inclusion criteria and were included in this study. These studies included a total of 25,764 patients undergoing neurosurgical procedures. Overlapping surgery was associated with an increased likelihood of being discharged home (OR, 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.44; P < 0.001) and a reduced 30-day unexpected return to the operating room (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.72-0.87; P < 0.001). Overlapping surgery did not significantly affect OR of length of surgery, 30-day mortality, or 30-day readmission.
   CONCLUSIONS: Overlapping neurosurgical procedures were not associated with worse patient outcomes. In addition, prospective studies are needed to assess the safety overlapping procedures.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the temporal changes in miR-502-5p expression after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and to find the time to peak level.
   METHODS: We collected serum from patients with aSAH (n = 129) at various time points (1, 3. 7, and 14 days postevent) and healthy controls (n = 40) at the Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wannan Medical College, from May 1, 2015 to January 31, 2016. We measured expression levels of miR-502-5p by polymerase chain reaction. We used the 2-Delta Ct method and calculated correlations among variables using Spearman rank correlation coefficient analysis. We used receiver operating characteristic curves to identify optimal levels of miR-502-5p for aSAH and multivariate logistic regression to analyze risk factors on the modified Rankin scale. We measured miR-502-5p expression at all 4 time points post-aSAH.
   RESULTS: Levels rose moderately from day 1 to day 7, with a substantial decrease from day 7 to day 14. The peak was at day 7. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that higher miR-502-5p levels at 7 days were associated with a significantly high risk for poor outcome post-aSAH.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that persistent elevated levels of miR-502-5p participate in the development of aSAH and may help physicians to adjust therapy for aSAH.

   CORTISOL; OUTCOMES
AB BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is used to manage patients with Cushing disease (CD) who have failed surgical/medical management. Because many patients with recurrent/persistent CD lack an identifiable adenoma on neuroimaging, whole-sellar SRS has been increasingly used. Thus, we sought to define the outcomes of patients undergoing whole-sellar SRS.
   METHODS: An international, multicenter, retrospective cohort design was used to define clinical/endocrine outcomes for patients undergoing whole-sellar SRS for CD. Propensity-score matching was used to compare patients undergoing whole-sellar SRS and patients who underwent discreet adenoma-targeted SRS.
   RESULTS: A total of 68 patients underwent whole-sellar SRS, with a mean endocrine follow-up of 5.3 years. The mean treatment volume was 2.6 cm(3), and the mean margin dose was 22.4 Gy. The 5-year actuarial remission rate was 75.9%, and the median time to remission was 12-months. Treatment volumes >1.6 cm(3) were associated with shorter times to remission (P < 0.05). The 5-year recurrence-free survival rate was 86.0%. Decreased margin and maximum treatment doses were associated with recurrence (P < 0.05). New pituitary hormone deficiency occurred in 15 patients (22.7%). An additional 210 patients were identified who underwent adenoma-targeted SRS. There was no difference in remission rate, time to remission, recurrence-free survival or new endocrinopathy development between patients who underwent whole-sellar SRS and those who underwent discreet adenoma-targeted SRS.
   CONCLUSIONS: Whole-sellar GKRS is effective in controlling CD when an adenoma is not clearly defined on imaging or when an invasive adenoma is suspected at the time of initial surgery. Patients who undergo whole-sellar SRS have outcomes and rates of new pituitary hormone deficiency similar to those of patients who undergo discrete adenoma-targeted GKRS.

AB OBJECTIVE: Dorsal longitudinal T-myelotomy is a long-established operation to treat severe spastic paraplegia. The present study aimed to report this surgical technique and investigate the efficacy of T-myelotomy for spasticity relief.
   METHODS: All cases undergoing T-myelotomy for treatment of intractable spastic paraplegia during 2009-2017 were included. The severity of spasticity was evaluated with the Modified Ashworth Scale, Penn Spasm Frequency Scale, Adductor Tone Rating Scale, degree of passive range of motion, and occurrence of abdominal muscle spasms. Other clinical assessments included deep tendon reflex assessed by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke scale, Babinski sign, healing of decubitus ulcers, and ambulatory status.
   RESULTS: Fourteen patients with a mean age of 39.3 +/- 13.4 years were included. The 7 patients with abdominal muscle spasms before surgery had no spasms after surgery. The Babinski sign was absent in all cases after surgery. Unhealed pressure ulcers in all 9 cases were healed after surgery. All 4 patients with a preoperative bed-hound condition were able to ambulate with a wheelchair. A statistically significant improvement in mean Modified Ashworth Scale score, degree of passive range of motion, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke scale score was found in the subgroup and overall analyses. There was also a statistically significant improvement in the Penn Spasm Frequency Scale and Adductor Tone Rating Scale scores.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dorsal longitudinal T-myelotomy remains an effective option for the treatment of intractable spastic paraplegia. It is suitable for, and may be an alternative to, intrathecal baclofen therapy for patients with complete spinal cord lesion or patients without hope of regaining motor function.

AB OBJECTIVE: Risk factors for the recurrence of surgically excised brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are poorly understood. In addition, ideal follow-up imaging paradigms to catch AVM recurrences are not well defined. We present a systematic review on risk factors for the recurrence of surgically resected AVMs and identify potential theories of recurrence.
   METHODS: A literature search was performed by a reference librarian, and after screening, 14 case reports and 16 case series were left for inclusion in the review. All possible data were abstracted by 2 authors, and the results were tabulated and descriptive statistics (mean, range; and proportions) were reported. No formal statistical analysis was performed as part of this study.
   RESULTS: Systematic review of the literature revealed 73 patients with a surgically resected AVM that recurred. The average age of first AVM presentation was 13.8 years, and most patients presented with hemorrhage (90%). After angiographically confirmed complete surgical resection, average time to AVM recurrence was 4.2 years. Rate of recurrence was 2.7% in adult series or case reports (n = 8). When we analyzed only pediatric case reports or series (n = 12), the average rate of recurrence was 9.5% but was as high as almost 14% in a series with compulsory short-term follow-up serial imaging. Four (5.5%) patients experienced re-recurrence of AVM after complete surgical excision of first AVM recurrence.
   CONCLUSIONS: AVM recurrence after complete surgical resection is a recognized risk that occurs primarily in children. Follow-up imaging within 1 year of surgery is strongly indicated for pediatric patients with surgically resected AVMs, even with postoperative angiographically confirmed complete excision.

AB OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that certain qualitative amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) characteristics can provide practical imaging clues for predicting O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) protein expression in primary low- and high-grade gliomas, pre-operatively and noninvasively.
   METHODS: Pathologically confirmed low- and high-grade gliomas with APT data and immunohistochemical (IHC) reports were recruited in this study. The MGMT protein expression status was classified by postsurgery specimen immunostaining. Subjects were divided into two groups, MGMT-positive and MGMT-negative group, according to the immunoreactivity of MGMT protein expression documented in IHC reports. APTw images scanned at 3T magnetic resonance preoperatively were retrospectively analyzed. Two neuroradiologists were trained to evaluate presence of certain APTw features. Kappa value was calculated to show the consistency between the 2 observers. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to evaluate relationships between the 2 groups on APTw features. Negative predictive value and positive predictive value was used to evaluate the ability of APTw characteristics in predicting MGMT protein expression. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of APTw characters. Two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
   RESULTS: Forty-two subjects were recruited in this study. Among them 38 specimens presented positive MGMT immunostaining (MGMT-positive group), 4 specimens were negative MGMT immunostaing (MGMT-negative group). There were, respectively, 37 and 5 APTw images appeared positive and negative APTw features. Differences between tumors of positive and negative MGMT expression on qualitative APTw features were significant (P = 0.020). The consistency coefficient of the 2 observers was 0.876 (kappa = 0.876). Three of five lIgliomas with negative APTw features showed MGMTnegative immunostaining, leading to a negative predictive value of 60%, and 36 of 37 cases presenting positive APTw characteristics were tumors of MGMT-positive expression, generating a positive predictive value of 97.3%. The area under curve was 0.849.
   CONCLUSIONS: APTw characteristics could be promising imaging markers by which to predict IHC MGMT expression in primary low- and high-grade gliomas preoperatively and noninvasively.

AB BACKGROUND: Tethered cord syndrome (TCS) is an increasingly recognized clinical condition, with untethering surgery considered the classically effective treatment. Yet, as evidence has aggregated, the surgical outcomes of untethering remain controversial. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the clinical outcomes in patients who underwent primary or revision untethering.
   METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at the Department of Spine Surgery of Changzheng Hospital between January and December 2016. Patients with TCS who underwent untethering surgery were recruited for the study. Information collected included demographic data, main clinical manifestations, and outcomes after untethering surgery.
   RESULTS: A total of 112 patients (60 males and 52 females) were included in this study, with mean follow-up of 13.7 years. The surgical outcomes of the primary untethering varied among symptoms, with remission rates of 30.0% for pain, 24.4% for paresthesia, 18.6% for motor deficit, 12.6% for bladder dysfunction, and 21.2% for bowel dysfunction. Moreover, 23.3%-40.2% of patients suffered deterioration after surgery during the follow-up period. Twenty-eight patients underwent revision untethering surgery. In these patients, the remission rate decreased by 5.6%-16.7% compared with the primary operation. Moreover, most patients (58.8%-70.6%) experienced no benefits after revision surgery.
   CONCLUSIONS: With a possible high risk of recurrence, further exploration of the indications and timing of the untethering surgery is needed. Conservative treatment and omnidirectional care might be a better choice for patients with retethering with recurrent symptoms.

AB OBJECTIVES: The anatomic variations of the sphenoid sinus and its relation to the surrounding neurovascular structures are a subject of interest. The purpose of this study was to radiologically assess the frequency of protrusion/dehiscence of key neurovascular landmarks surrounding the Egyptians' sphenoid.
   METHODS: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study of sinonasal computed tomography of the sphenoid sinus in 500 adult Egyptians, conducted at Mansoura University Hospitals; Egypt, over a period of 1 year. Two archives were used for collecting the data; the hard archive and the electronic archive. Variables of interest included the extent of sphenoid sinus pneumatization; intersphenoid septation pattern; protrusion/dehiscence of the internal carotid artery, optic nerve, maxillary nerve, and vidian nerve; and detection of the Onodi cell.
   RESULTS: Population of this study included 265 women and 235 men. Their ages ranged from 18-68 years. The bilateral sellar-type pneumatization was shown as the most common pneumatization type (96.8%). Pneumatizations of the pterygoid process, anterior clinoid process, and greater wing of the sphenoid were identified in 9.3%, 8.9%, and 31.8% consequently. A single intersphenoid septum was detected in 85.2%, whereas multiple intersphenoid septums were noted in 11.6%. Protrusion of the internal carotid artery, optic nerve, vidian nerve, and maxillary nerve was recorded in 8.5%, 9.1%, 6.6%, and 3.4% consequently, while dehiscence was reported in 7.2%, 15%, 11.9%, and 4.2% consequently as well. Onodi cell was recognized in 18%.
   CONCLUSIONS: This radiologic study highlights significant variations of surgically important anatomic structures related to the sphenoid sinus in Egyptians.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between epidurographic contrast dispersal patterns and both immediate and short-term clinical effectiveness of lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESIs) in patients with radicular back pain.
   METHODS: A digital database of 64 patients who underwent single-level lumbar TFESI for unilateral lumbar radicular pain was scanned. The type of contrast pattern was analyzed by 1 physiatrist and defined as follows: type 1 (tubular appearance), type 2 (nerve root visible as a filling defect), or type 3 (cloud-like appearance). Pain was evaluated with a visual analog scale (VAS) and recorded before injection and 2 days, 2 weeks, and 3 months after injection.
   RESULTS: The mean age was 45.9 +/- 13.5 years (range, 22-80 years), and the mean duration of symptoms was 5.7 +/- 4.2 months. Contrast distribution patterns were as follows: type 1 in 33 patients (51.6%), type 2 in 18 patients (28.1%), and type 3 in 13 patients (20.3%). Mean decrease in VAS scores at all time points was statistically significant in 3 types of contrast dispersal patterns (P < 0.05). Differences in improvements of VAS scores obtained at any assessment period and success rates were not statistically significant between groups. However, the ratio of patients who achieved 50% or greater reduction in pain scores was higher in type 1 and type 2 than type 3 at each follow-up point.
   CONCLUSIONS: TFSEIs have a beneficial effect in managing lumbar radicular pain regardless of contrast pattern type. Success rates were higher in type 1 and type 2 than type 3.

AB BACKGROUND: Pineoblastoma is a rare malignant tumor of the pineal gland, which is more common in children.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 18 cases of pineoblastoma in children (10 girls), including general, clinical, and therapeutic information, and factors affecting prognosis.
   RESULTS: The median age of the children was 51.7 months (range, 19-156 months). Presenting symptoms included vomiting (64.70%), headache (47.06%), weak or unsteady walking (35.29%), and nausea (29.41%). Rarer symptoms (1 patient each) included limb rigidity, inability to speak, double vision, fever, and Parinaud syndrome. Five and 13 children, respectively, underwent subtotal and gross total resection; 5 and 13 children received adjuvant craniospinal irradiation therapy and chemotherapy. Two children received both craniospinal irradiation and chemotherapy. The 5-year overall survival of the patients was 27.8% (5/18). The survival rate of children older than 4 years (66.7%) was significantly higher than that of younger children (8.3%). The 5-year overall survival rate of boys (50.7%) was higher than that of girls (10.0%); that of children who underwent gross total resection (30.8%) was higher than that of children who underwent subtotal resection (20.0%); and that of children treated with adjuvant craniospinal irradiation (50.7%) was higher than that of those not given craniospinal irradiation (10.0%). However, in each of these 3 comparisons the differences were not significant.
   CONCLUSION: Pineoblastoma is rare but often fatal, especially in children younger than 4 years. Survival rates tend to be higher in boys, children undergoing gross total resection (rather than subtotal), and those given craniospinal irradiation.

AB OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic endonasal surgery has evolved in recent decades, requiring comparable advances in reconstructive techniques. This study aimed to retrospectively review outcomes of endoscopic anterior skull base reconstruction and to analyze factors associated with failures.
   METHODS: Data from patients who underwent endoscopic endonasal anterior skull base reconstruction in a single institution between 1998 and 2017 were collected. Patients were stratified according to selected risk factors: sex; age; previous surgery; disease treated (cerebrospinal fluid leaks, benign tumors, malignant tumors); single or multiple defects; defect dimension (<1 cm(2), 1-2 cm 2 , 2-6 cm(2), >6 cm(2)) and site (olfactory cleft, ethmoidal roof, planum sphenoidalis, posterior wall of frontal sinus); reconstruction technique (overlay graft, multilayer grafts, pedicled flap) and materials used; postoperative radiotherapy; and year of surgery. Statistical significance was assessed using Fisher exact test. Univariate logistic regression was implemented to analyze the association between risk factors and failures.
   RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by 513 cases with median follow-up of 96 months (range, 12-257 months). Success rate for initial repair was 95% (487/513), with 100% success rate for secondary closure after revision surgery. Failures were not significantly related to sex (P = 0.54), reconstruction technique (P = 028), location of defect (P = 0.65), dimension (P = 0.69), disease (P 0.83), or postoperative radiotherapy (P = 0.83). Year of surgery, considered as a continuous variable, was associated with a statistically significant reduction of failures (odds ratio = 0.89, P = 0.005).
   CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic surgery is safe and effective for anterior skull base reconstruction. Refinements in surgical technique and increasing experience have contributed to improved success rates.

AB BACKGROUND: Direct lateral (DLIF) and transforaminal (TLIF) lumbar interbody fusions have been shown to produce satisfactory clinical outcomes with significant reduction in pain and functional disability. Despite their increasing use in complex spinal deformity surgeries, there is a paucity of data comparing outcome measures, which this study addresses.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective, comparative study of patients who underwent minimally invasive, 1-level TLIF or DLIF between 2013 and 2015. Only patients 18 years and older were included. Preoperative and demographic variables were collected, and clinical outcome measures were compared between cohorts.
   RESULTS: In total, 46 patients were included (DLIF: 17 patients; TLIF: 29 patients). Preoperatively, there was no difference in visual analog scale pain score or Oswestry Disability Index. Overall, there was a significant improvement in the postoperative visual analog scale score and Oswestry Disability Index in the separate cohorts, without significant difference when compared. The duration of postoperative narcotic use was similar in both cohorts (DLIF: 4.8 +/- 4.7 months vs. TLIF: 5.2 +/- 5.1 months, P = 0.82). Significantly more patients in DLIF cohort were cleared for work after surgery. Patients who underwent MIS TLIF had a significantly longer time to return to work (7.1 +/- 4.8 months) compared with patients undergoing DLIF (2.3 +/- 1.3, P = 0.006). There was a greater incidence of reoperation in the TLIF cohort.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both MIS TLIF and DLIF provide long-term improvement in pain andfunctional outcomes, with an overall reduction in postoperative narcotic requirement. However, there was a significantly longer time to return to work and a greater incidence of reoperation in the TLIF cohort compared with the patients who underwent DLIF.

AB PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical stability and the clinical and radiographic outcomes in patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) using an oblique bridging cage with a particular focus on subsidence.
   METHODS: Finite element models were developed to compare the biomechanics of the oblique cage with conventional posterior lumbar interbody fusion and banana-shaped cages with TLIF. Additionally, a retrospective review of a prospective collected database was performed to investigate the clinical and radiologic results with a focus on the subsidence rate using an oblique polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage with a bicortical load-bearing design. We included 87 patients with degenerative pathologic conditions of the lumbar spine who underwent TLIF. The clinical outcome was assessed using the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire and the visual analogue scale. Fusion and subsidence rates were assessed radiographically.
   RESULTS: The finite element models showed no differences in stability on compression or extension/flexion. The oblique cage differed in terms of the location of the maximal stresses. A total of 105 levels were fused. The level at which fusion was most frequently performed was L4-L5 (59%). The fusion rate was 93.2% after 24 months. Subsidence was found at 4 levels after the last follow-up visit (3.9%). Overall clinical outcome improvement was achieved after 24 months.
   CONCLUSION: Regarding fusion, the use of an oblique PEEK cage with a cortical load-bearing design provided highly satisfactory clinical and radiologic results after 2 years. A review of the literature suggests a lower rate of cage subsidence after lumbar interbody fusion using bridging cages rather than single cages.

AB BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury may cause cortical reconstruction. We, therefore explored the changes in cortical activation before and after anterior cervical decompression and fusion surgery in patients with Hirayama disease (HD).
   METHODS: In total, 17 cases with HD underwent anterior cervical decompression and fusion surgery. Blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed preoperatively, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. Activated voxels were compared between both hands after adjusting for head motion, slice timing, spatial normalization, and image smoothing. Grip strength also was tested in both hands.
   RESULTS: A retrospective review indicated that the grip strength of the asymptomatic hand was significantly stronger than the symptomatic hand at the time point before the surgery, 3 months after surgery, 6 months after surgery, and 1 year after surgery (P < 0.001). The grip strength of both symptomatic and asymptomatic hands continuously increased within 6 months after surgery (P < 0.05), but it stopped at 1 year after the surgery. The symptomatic limb tends to produce bilateral activation in the primary motor area (M1) during motor tasks. Both contralateral and ipsilateral M1 activation were stronger in symptomatic hand tasks preoperatively (P < 0.05). Both contralateral and ipsilateral activation in M1 during symptomatic hand tasks began to reduce after surgery, and statistical significance was observed 6 months after surgery (P < 0.05). Contralateral activation was relatively even over 6 months of the surgery (P > 0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: After surgery, pathologic reconstruction may have occurred in the primary motor cortex. Recovery of motor function in the symptomatic limb was accompanied by decreased ipsilateral and contralateral M1 activation, as well as symptom improvement. These findings suggested that postoperative cortical activation changes may reflect functional recovery in HD.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical value of three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) reconstruction of the sphenoid sinus separation in localizing sellar floor during endonasal transsphenoidal surgery and determine size and location of sellar floor fenestration.
   METHODS: There were 51 patients eligible for study inclusion. Preoperative CT scan of the paranasal sinus and CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland were obtained. Sphenoid sinus separation was reconstructed using Mimics 15.0 software, and quantity, shape, and orientation were observed and compared with intraoperative data to guide the localization of sellar floor. Anatomic variation of the sphenoid sinus and adjacent structures, tumor and sella turcica morphology, minimal distance between the cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery bilaterally, and shortest distance from the midline were measured.
   RESULTS: Based on the shape of the sphenoid sinus separation, sellar floor was accurately localized in all cases. Intraoperative sphenoid sinus separation was consistent with preoperative three-dimensional CT reconstruction images. The sellar floor was extremely small in 2 patients, and insufficient fenestration of sellar floor negatively affected tumor resection. Preoperative three-dimensional CT reconstruction is helpful for accurate and rapid localization of sellar floor.
   CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic variation of sphenoid sinus and adjacent structures, characteristics of tumor and sella, minimum distance between bilateral cavernous segment of the internal carotid artery, and shortest distance from midline are helpful for establishment of individualized sellar floor fenestration.

AB BACKGROUND: Postoperative dysphagia is a known complication of anterior cervical surgery, but its incidence and possible mechanisms are seldom reported after occipitocervical fusion (OCF). Our objective was to study the relationship between craniocervical alignment and the development of dysphagia after OCF for the treatment of basilar invagination with atlantoaxial instability.
   METHODS: The study consisted of a retrospective series and a prospective series. Seventy-eight patients who underwent OCF (30 male, 48 female) were reviewed in the retrospective series. The presence and duration of postoperative dysphagia were recorded with an in-person questionnaire or telephone interview. Sagittal reconstructed computed tomography images before and after the procedure were collected. The O-C2 angle and C2-C7 angle were measured. The relationship of these parameters and their influence to the incidence of dysphagia were analyzed. The patients were grouped according to whether they developed postoperative dysphagia (group A) or not (group B). A prospective case series of 27 patients (group C) were reported to verify the influence of O-C2 angle on postoperative dysphagia.
   RESULTS: In the retrospective case series, 19 patients (24.4%) complained of postoperative dysphagia after OCF. The change in the O-C2 angle was significantly lower in group A than in group B (P < 0.001). In the prospective case series, only 1 patient (3.7%) complained of postoperative dysphagia.
   CONCLUSIONS: O-C2 angle plays an important role in the development of postoperative dysphagia after OCF procedure. Careful intraoperative alignment of the O-C2 angle may help to reduce the incidence and severity of postoperative dysphagia after OCF.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess quality of life of patients who underwent decompressive craniectomy (DC) for traumatic brain injury and satisfaction of caregivers with outcomes.
   METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care urban center in Pakistan. All patients with severe traumatic brain injury who underwent DC and survived >6 months were included. Outcomes were assessed using 2 scales: Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended and Quality of Life After Traumatic Brain Injury (QOLIBRI). The proforma was translated and validated into the national language. Patient caregivers were interviewed to ask if they would opt for DC in a similar situation in future.
   RESULTS: The study comprised 40 patients, including 35 male (88%) and 5 female (12%) patients. Mean age of patients was 26.5 +/- 9.5 years. Mean Glasgow Coma Scale score at presentation was 8.34 +/- 3.22. Median follow-up was 12 months (range, 6-18 months). Mean Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score was 5.35 +/- 1.9, which correlates with an unfavorable outcome. Mean QOLIBRI score was 59.65 +/- 21.27. Family members of 38 (95%) patients were content with their decision to give consent for DC in their patients. Spearman correlation for different domains of QOLIBRI and Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended was statistically significant for all parameters except social relationship.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mean QOLIBRI score of patients undergoing DC was 59.65 +/- 21.27. Most caregivers (95%) were satisfied with their decision to consent for DC. Patient-reported health-related quality of life assessment is necessary to assess impact of traumatic brain injury.

AB OBJECTIVE: With the development of frontal contusion, patients may rapidly deteriorate or even die. Experience in the treatment of frontal contusion in high-altitude regions is limited; thus, we explore a grading system for the treatment of frontal lobe contusion.
   METHODS: A total of 446 patients with frontal contusions in a high-altitude regions were reviewed retrospectively. We combined the patients' computed tomography scans of the head and clinical features for grading. The score determined the treatment and whether the bone flap was removed. If the patient's condition deteriorated, and the score was greater than 1, the patient was treated surgically. At the same time, the risk factors of deterioration were analyzed. Finally, the Glasgow Outcome Scale of conservative treatment and surgical treatment groups was analyzed.
   RESULTS: Among the 446 patients, 254 were conservatively treated, and 28 worsened and underwent surgical treatment. In total, 122 patients received an operation. Logistic regression analysis indicated that scattered hematoma, anterior angle of the ventricle, and hemoglobin concentration were risk factors. The postoperative Glasgow Outcome Scale of conservative treatment and surgical treatment groups was analyzed; the good healing rate of the conservative treatment group was 91.12%, the good healing rate of the retain-bone flap surgical group was 75%, and the good healing rate of the remove-bone flap surgical group was 63.33%. The failure rates of the groups were 9.38% and 7.78%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: This grading system could guide frontal contusion treatment, which could help patients to achieve a good healing rate and reduce the failure rate.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore the value of the application of neuroendoscopy techniques in the treatment of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt blockage.
   METHODS: Our study included 3 plans for revision surgeries for VP shunt blockage. In plan A, the choroid plexus or ependyma growing inside the ventricular catheter was completely removed. In plan B, the terminal part of the ventricular catheter was clipped and removed. In plan C, the ventricular catheter was carefully extracted with the aid of neuroendoscopy, and the tissues blocking the catheter were removed. The ventricular catheter was then reinserted into the lateral ventricle.
   RESULTS: The side holes of the tube may be blocked by cerebral tissue, granulation tissue, newly formed blood vessels, choroid plexus, or ependyma. Five patients successfully underwent plan A revision surgery, 8 patients underwent plan B revision surgery, and the remaining 22 patients underwent plan C revision surgery. After the operation, 34 patients experienced relief of symptoms of elevated intracranial pressure. In all patients, the shunt obstruction was resolved.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neuroendoscopy techniques can be used to reveal the various causes of shunt obstruction. Any attempt to extract the tube should be performed with the aid of a neuroendoscope. The 3 surgical revision strategies for a blocked catheter are described for the first time in the literature. These approaches can reduce the operation time, the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, and the risk of infection.

AB OBJECTIVES: A precise assessment of angioarchitectural characteristics using noninvasive imaging is helpful for serial follow-up and weighting risk of natural history in unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM). This study aimed to test the hypothesis that susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) would provide an accurate evaluation of angioarchitectural features of unruptured bAVM.
   METHODS: A total of 81 consecutive patients with unruptured bAVM were examined. Image quality of SWI for the assessment of bAVM angioarchitectural features was determined by a 5-point scale. The accuracy of SWI for detection of angioarchitectural features was evaluated using digital subtraction angiography as a standard reference and further compared among unruptured bAVMs with or without silent intralesional microhemorrhage on SWI to examine the potential confounding effect of microhemorrhage on image analysis.
   RESULTS: All lesions were identified on SWI. Image quality of SWI was judged to be at least adequate for diagnosis (range, 3-5) in all patients by both readers. Using digital subtraction angiography as a reference standard, the area under the receiver operating curve of detection of deep or posterior fossa location, exclusively deep venous drainage, venous ectasia, venous varices, and the presence of associated aneurysm on SWI was 1, 0.93, 0.94, 0.95, and 0.83, respectively. Silent intralesional microhemorrhage were detected in 39 patients (48.15%) on SWI and no significant difference (P > 0.05) was found in angioarchitectural features between patients with and without silent microhemorrhage.
   CONCLUSIONS: SWI might he a noninvasive alternative technique for angiography in the angioarchitectural assessment of unruptured bAVM.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess accuracy and safety of self-developed customized guiding templates for cervical pedicle screw (CPS) insertion surgery.
   METHODS: From July 2016 to December 2017, 57 screws were implanted in 9 patients with the assistance of customized guiding templates. Customized guiding templates were manufactured from acrylonitrile-butadienestyrene plastic material using a three-dimensional printer after establishing pedicle screw trajectories for each vertebra with the assistance of a virtual surgical planning software program, developed by our team, for the insertion of CPSs.
   RESULTS: CPSs were evaluated using the following grading system: grade 0 (contained), grade 1 (exposure), grade 2 (perforation), and grade 3 (penetration). Each patient underwent postoperative computed tomography to evaluate accuracy of screw position. Of 57 screws, 54 were graded 0, and 3 were graded 1; no screws were graded 2 or 3. No vascular or nerve injuries were noted after the operations.
   CONCLUSIONS: CPSs, which provide strong biologic strength, are especially suitable for treating osteoporosis and severe deformity. However, CPS insertion remains a challenging procedure with high incidences of vascular and nerve injuries reported. The results of this study indicate that use of customized guiding templates can improve safety of CPS insertion surgery.

   ASSOCIATION
AB BACKGROUND: The extent of resection (EOR) and residual tumor volume (RTV) are 2 pivotal predictors influencing the survival of patients with new-onset adult glioblastoma. Which of these 2 factors is more important remains unclear, however. The present aimed to evaluate and compare the accuracy of EOR and RTV, based on contrast-enhancing (CE) T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (F) MRI, as prognostic factors in these patients.
   METHODS: In this retrospective study, data were extracted from the databases of 2 hospitals between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2015. The subjects were divided into 2 groups, the total resection group and the partial resection group. The analysis comprised EOR and RTV. Statistical analysis was performed after controlling for other relevant factors.
   RESULTS: We analyzed 292 patients with new-onset glioblastoma who met the inclusion criteria. In the partial resection group, univariate analysis revealed that CE-EOR, CE-RTV, F-EOR, and F-RTV were correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), but multivariate analysis identified no correlation between CE-EOR or F-EOR and PFS or OS. In the total resection group, F-EOR and F-RTV were correlated with PFS and OS in univariate analysis, but F-EOR was not correlated in multivariate analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of total or partial CE tumor resection, EOR might not be an independent prognostic factor. In contrast, RTV has the potential to offer greater predictive power for the prognosis of new-onset adult glioblastoma. Further investigations of the correlations of RTV and EOR with survival in patients with new-onset glioblastoma are needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess an alternative method of cortical bone trajectory (CBT) screw placement in the thoracic spine from T1 to 18 and to investigate the proper entry point, screw insertion angle, screw length, and diameter.
   METHODS: Computed tomography images of 80 patients were used to measure all related parameters. Ten cadaveric spines were studied and 4.5-mm screws were inserted into both sides of the vertebrae. Computed tomography of all vertebrae previously inserted with CBT screws was performed and lateral or medial pedicle wall violation was checked.
   RESULTS: Of the inserted 160 CBT screws, 4125% (66/160) penetrated the lateral pedicle wall, and the proportion of medial pedicle wall violation accounted for 0.625% (1/160). Maximal screw length tended to gradually increase from T1 to T8 (from 24.54 mm at T1 to 29.53 mm at T8). Compared with T4 and T5, maximal screw diameters of other thoracic levels were wider, ranging from 4.63 mm at T4 to 5.53 mm at T8. The greatest lateral angle was 8.66 degrees in men and 8.39 degrees in women at T8, whereas the smallest lateral angle was 4.97 degrees in men and 4.67 degrees in women at T1. The cephalad angle ranged from 1723 degrees at T7 to 31.50 degrees at T1 and it was significantly larger in men at T7 (P < 0.05), T6 and T8 (P < 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this study, we suggest that patients could be placed with 4.5 x 25.0-30.0 mm CBT screws from T1 to T8 through the pedicle or pedicle rib unit.

AB BACKGROUND: There is a strong relationship between lower back pain and paraspinal muscle atrophy. In this study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of lumbar paravertebral muscle atrophy in patients with and without single-level disc herniation.
   METHODS: The 110 retrospectively analyzed patients in this study were divided into 2 groups. Group A included 55 patients with radiologically confirmed single-level disc herniation with back pain and radiculopathy. Group B included 55 patients with back pain without radiologic lumbar disc herniation. The paravertebral muscle cross-sectional areas were measured in both groups by 2 independent observers.
   RESULTS: In total, 68 women and 42 men were examined. Their mean age was 40.85 years old. The mean ages of groups A and B were 42.49 and 39.22 years, respectively. The cross-sectional areas of the multifidus muscles (MM) and erector spinae muscles were significantly greater in group B than in group A (P < 0.0001). However, there were no statistically significant differences in the psoas major cross-sectional areas, disc heights, and perpendicular distances between the MM and the laminae.
   CONCLUSIONS: The MM and erector spinae muscle groups are innervated by the dorsal root of the spinal nerve arising from the same level; therefore, long-term pressure on the root caused by disc herniation can cause atrophy and degeneration of that muscle group.

AB BACKGROUND: The main concern with revision lumbar surgery is the possibility of neurologic complications. This retrospective study was conducted to clarify the risk factors, especially the effects of nerve stretching, for postoperative neurologic complications in posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) without excessive nerve retraction by bilateral total facetectomy as revision surgery.
   METHODS: Between 2005 and 2015, 50 consecutive patients underwent revision PLIF for recurrent stenosis or recurrent disc herniation. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with neurological complications (NC group) and patients without neurological complications (non-NC group). Radiological examinations to evaluate the magnitude of nerve stretching included the following pre- and postoperative plain radiograph measurements: anterolisthesis at flexion, intervertebral lordosis in the neutral position, and posterior disc height in the neutral position.
   RESULTS: Sixteen patients (32%) had neurological complications. The decrease in intervertebral lordosis was significantly greater in the NC group than that in the non-NC group (0.8 degrees vs. -1.5 degrees , P < 0.05). Distraction of the posterior disc height was significantly greater in the NC group than that in the non-NC group (5.0 mm vs. 2.6 mm, P < 0.01). Neurological complications were seen in all patients with a decrease in in vertebral lordosis >3 degrees and distraction of the posterior disc height >3 mm.
   CONCLUSIONS: Decreased intervertebral lordosis, and distraction of the posterior disc height, which can be controlled by surgeons, appear to be risk factors for neurological complications following revision PLIF. In revision PLIF, surgeons should create segmental lordosis without excessive disc height distraction.

AB BACKGROUND: The new full power-assisted (FPA) technique used in pedicle screw placement during adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) surgery streamlines the surgical procedure and reduces repetitive surgeon tasks. However, the use of the FPA technique may also negatively affect the surgical safety and efficacy of patients with AIS.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of the FPA technique on the accuracy of pedicle screw placement, as well as on operating time, blood loss, and clinical outcomes.
   METHODS: A total of 105 patients with AIS with major thoracic curves treated with posterior instrumentation and fusion were randomized into 2 groups. With the new FPA technique, 427 pedicle screws were implanted in the thoracic region in 35 patients (the FPA group), and using the conventional freehand (FH) technique, 896 screws were implanted in 70 patients (the FH group). The primary end point screw position was assessed using postoperative computed tomography. Secondary end points, such as operative time, blood loss, and clinical outcomes, were also assessed.
   RESULTS: The FPA technique did not significantly affect the accuracy rate of the pedicle screw placement, scoliosis correction, total operating time, or total blood loss. However, the surgical times for the screw insertion phase and for each screw placement were significantly shorter for the FPA group compared with the FH group (P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the conventional manual tools, use of the FPA technique seemed to be superior and had relatively shorter pedicle screw placement times, with comparable surgical safety and efficacy for patients with AIS.

ID METAANALYSIS; INSTRUMENTATION; SPINE
AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate 5-year outcomes between microendoscopy-assisted minimally invasive (MIS) and open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF).
   METHODS: Sixty single-level MIS and open surgeries were performed (30 patients in either group). Perioperative parameters including operative duration, intraoperative estimated blood loss, fluoroscopy time, postoperative analgesic usage, ambulatory time, and complications were recorded. Visual analog scale (back and leg), Japanese Orthopaedics Association score, and Oswestry Disability Index were obtained. Finally, self-evaluation of surgical outcomes (modified MacNab criteria), interbody fusion rate (Bridwell grade 1), and prevalence of adjacent segment degeneration were assessed.
   RESULTS: Intraoperative estimated blood loss and postoperative analgesia usage were reduced in the MIS group, and patients undergoing microendoscopy-assisted MIS-TLIF ambulated earlier than those receiving open TLIF postoperatively. Nevertheless, surgical duration and fluoroscopy time were prolonged in the MIS group. Complication incidences were similar in both groups. Visual analog scale (back and leg), Japanese Orthopaedics Association, and Oswestry Disability Index were improved at 1 month, 2 years, and 5 years postoperatively in both groups when compared with preoperative scores. Significant improvements in these scores were found in the MIS group at 1 month postoperatively, while at 2 years and 5 years postoperatively, both groups revealed comparable aforementioned scores. Excellent and perfect scale rating, interbody fusion rate, and adjacent segment degeneration prevalence between the groups were almost similar.
   CONCLUSIONS: Microendoscopy-assisted MIS-TLIF is comparable with open TLIF in terms of 5-year outcomes with additional benefits of reduced intraoperative iatrogenic injury, decreased initial pain, minimized activity restrictions, and accelerated ambulation recovery after surgery.

AB OBJECTIVE: The need for neurosurgical supervision as well as the general safety and utility of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine in children remains controversial. We present the largest descriptive cohort study of cervical flexion-extension MRI scans in pediatric patients to help elucidate the safety and utility of this technique.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all cervical spine MRI scans performed at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford from 2009 to 2015. We identified 66 dynamic cervical MRI scans performed in 45 children and 2 young adults for further study.
   RESULTS: General anesthesia was used in 43 scans. The neuroradiology team performed all scans with no direct supervision by the neurosurgery team. There were no adverse events. Dynamic MRI detected significant instability that was not clearly seen on dynamic radiographs (5 patients) and cord compression not seen on static MRI (9 patients). One patient with asymptomatic instability found on flexion-extension radiographs had no cord compression with movement on MRI and was managed conservatively. Two neonates with significant congenital malformations of the cervical spine were cleared for operative positioning for cardiac procedures based on flexion-extension MRI.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic MRI is a safe tool for evaluating the cervical spine and cervicomedullary junction in various pediatric populations and can be performed safely without direct neurosurgical supervision. We describe for the first time the use of flexion-extension MRI to clear neonates with severe congenital cervical spine abnormalities for complex operative positioning and further care in the intensive care unit.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to report the authors' experience with endovascular treatment (EVT) of ophthalmic artery (OA) aneurysms and to investigate risk factors for visual complications of EVT for unruptured OA aneurysms.
   METHODS: Fifty-four patients with unruptured OA aneurysms subjected to EVT were recruited for this study from March 2010 to December 2017. The clinical and angiographic outcomes of all 54 patients were investigated and analyzed retrospectively.
   RESULTS: Of the 54 patients included in this study, 5 patients (9.3%) had visual complications, including asymptomatic unintended OA occlusion in 2 patients (3.7%) and symptomatic complications in 3 patients (5.6%); 2 patients (3.7%) had transient visual complications, and 1 (1.9%) had a permanent complication. No subacute or delayed visual complications occurred during the 20.8-month follow-up period. OA incorporation by the aneurysm (odds ratio [OR], 3.471; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.115-9.184; P = 0.038) and intentional OA occlusion (OR, 1.820; 95% CI, 1.248-6.221; P = 0.044) were independent risk factors for visual complications in a multivariate logistic regression analysis.
   CONCLUSIONS: The visual complication rate was 9.3% when performing EVT for unruptured OA aneurysms. OA aneurysms with OA incorporation by the aneurysm might be at higher risk of visual complications when performing EVT. Intentional OA occlusion should be performed with caution, even though a patient may have favorable collaterals during balloon test occlusion.

AB OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, distribution characteristics, and radiographic features of the ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) combined with ossification of the nuchal ligament (ONL) and to analyze the correlation between the location of ONL and degree of ossification in patients with cervical OPLL.
   METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2016, the clinical data of 217 patients with cervical OPLL were reviewed retrospectively. Type and location of OPLL and ONL were determined on computed tomography images and lateral radiograph films. For patients with the local type of ONL, the segment with the largest spinal canal occupation ratio (COR) of OPLL was determined on cross-sectional computed tomography slices. The correlation between the location of ONL and segment with the largest COR of OPLL was evaluated.
   RESULTS: Of the 217 patients with cervical OPLL, 118 patients (54.4%) had OPLL combined with ONL (92 male and 26 female patients). The incidence of ONL was almost 1.4 times greater in males than in female patients (P = 0.03). C5-C6 (49.5%) was the segment at which ONL occurred most. Of 60 patients with the local type of ONL, 34 patients' ONL was located at the segment with largest COR of OPLL. The matching ratio was the largest (77.8%) when the type of OPLL was locally circumscribed (P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of ONL was 54.4% in patients with cervical OPLL, and male patients were affected more than female patients. ONL occurred most in segment C5-C6. The location of local-type ONL commonly corresponded to the segment with the largest COR of OPLL when type of OPLL was circumscribed.

AB PURPOSE: To compare efficacy and safety of microvascular decompression (MVD) and Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) treatments for trigeminal neuralgia.
   METHOD: Patients with primary trigeminal neuralgia were randomly divided into 2 groups to undergo either MVD or GKS. All patients were followed for 2 years to evaluate efficacy, recurrence rates, and complications of treatment.
   RESULTS: Of 441 enrolled patients, 220 were in the MVD group, and 221 were in the GKS group. There were no deaths in either group. At the 2-year follow-up, 183 patients (83%) in the MVD group reported complete pain relief, 5 (2%) had obvious pain relief, and 20 (9%) had no relief. In the GKS group, 55 patients (25%) reported complete pain relief, 106 (48%) had obvious pain relief, and 37 (17%) had no relief. There was no significant difference in the recurrence rate (0.45% vs. 0.9%) between the 2 groups. The most common complications in the MVD group were chemical meningitis (6%), cerebrospinal fluid leakage (4%), and facial palsy (4%). Loss of corneal reflex (6%) and facial numbness (5%) were the most common complications in the GKS group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both MVD and GKS are effective surgical treatments for trigeminal neuralgia. The rate of complete pain relief in the MVD group was significantly superior to the rate of complete pain relief in the GKS group. There was no significant difference in recurrence rates between the groups; however, there were more severe complications in the MVD group than in the GKS group.

AB BACKGROUND: Because of a lack of markers for predicting prognosis and an underlying mechanism, patients with primary brainstem hemorrhage (PBH) are currently treated with multiple strategies, but most of them have poor outcomes in a comparison with patients with supratentorial intracranial hemorrhage. Recently, it has been reported that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) represents a novel composite inflammatory marker to predict the prognosis of patients with intracranial hemorrhage, a majority of whom have supratentorial hemorrhage. In this report, we aim to assess the potential predictive value of NLR in patients with PBH. In addition, other available laboratory parameters, including platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and admission blood glucose level (ABG), will be also investigated as markers for prognosis in patients with PBH.
   METHODS: This study retrospectively enrolled 225 patients with acute PBH who were admitted West China Hospital from January 2012 to December 2016. ABG and absolute numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, white blood cells, and platelets were extracted from electronic medical records. ABG, NLR, and PLR were calculated and further assessed using multivariable logistic regression analysis for understanding the associations of treatment outcomes. The comparison of predictive power of independent predictors was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic.
   RESULTS: Of 225 inpatients, NLR (odds ratio [OR], 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]. 1.24 2.62, P< 0.01), PLR (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.11 2.36; P = 0.013), and ABG (OR, 6.57; 95% CI, 2.78 15.52; P < 0.01) were independently associated with 90-day status in 112 patients with unfavorable outcomes. All 3 parameters also correlated with admission Glasgow Coma Scale score (r = -0.244, P < 0.001; r = -0.292, P < 0.001; r = -0.661, P < 0.01) and absolute neutrophil counts (r = 0.645, P < 0.001; r = 0.347, P < 0.001; r = 0.695, P < 0.01). Meanwhile, NLR exhibits a comparable predictive power by comparing with PLR (area under the curve [AUC], 0.694; 95%, CI, 0.626-0.764; P < 0.001; versus AUC, 0.662; 95% CI, 0.596-0.724; P < 0.001). In addition, ABG shows a positive predictive value (AUC, 0.784; 95% CI, 0.725 0.832; P < 0.001). The best independent predictive cutoff points were 6.65, 59.3, and 7.81 mmol/L for NLR, PLR, and ABG, respectively. Nevertheless, a combination of 3 parameters shows the best predictive ability (AUC, 0.835; 95% CI, 0.781-0.883; P < 0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: NLR, PLR, and ABG can be used to independently predict 90-day functional outcome in patients after PBH. When combined, they have better predictive power in identifying PBH patients with a poor prognosis. To our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal the associations between NLR, PLR, and hyperglycemia and the functional outcomes of patient with PBH. In associating with previously studies on hemorrhage site, our results provide a good opportunity to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of PBH.

AB BACKGROUND: Anterior odontoid screw fixation (AOSF) has been suggested as the optimal treatment for type II and some shallow type III odontoid fractures. However, only the classical surgical trajectory is available; no newer entry points or trajectories have been reported.
   METHODS: We evaluated the anatomic feasibility of a trajectory for AOSF using 3-dimensional (3D) screw insertion simulation software (Mimics). Computed tomography (CT) scans of patients (65 males and 59 females) with normal cervical structures were obtained consecutively, and the axes were reconstructed in 3 dimensions by Mimics software. Then simulated operations were performed using 2 new entry points below the superior articular process using bilateral screws of different diameters (group 1: 4 mm and 4 mm; group 2: 4 mm and 3.5 mm; group 3: 3.5 mm and 3.5 mm). The success rates and the required screw lengths were recorded and analyzed.
   RESULTS: The success rates were 79.03% for group 1, 95.16% for group 2, and 98.39% for group 3. The success rates for groups 2 and 3 did not differ significantly, and both were significantly better than the rate for group 1 The success rate was much higher in males than in females in group 1, but the success rate was similar in males and females in the other 2 groups. Screw lengths did not differ significantly among the 3 groups, but an effect of sex was apparent.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our modified trajectory is anatomically feasible for fixation of anterior odontoid fractures, but further anatomic experiments and clinical research are needed.

AB OBJECTIVE: To explore whether we should use the Pipeline embolization device (PED) as the primary treatment modality for small and tiny aneurysms at anterior circulation.
   METHODS: This retrospective study included 409 cases of small and tiny aneurysms, including aneurysms treated by the PED (n = 77), coiling (n = 51), and stent-assisted coiling (SAC) (n = 281). We also made a comparison regarding the safety and efficacy among these treatment modalities.
   RESULTS: A total of 55 patients with 77 small aneurysms were treated with PEDs. Technical success was achieved in 98.4% of procedures. The complete occlusion rate was 75.9% (44/58). Both the morbidity and mortality rates were 1.8%. Comparing the 3 treatment modalities, the technical event rate tended to be the highest in the PED group (4.8% vs. 2.0% and 1.1%; PED vs. Coil vs. SAC; P = 0.100), and the use of a PED neither significantly shortened the procedure duration (127.2 +/- 62.8 vs. 115 +/- 37.1 and 112.8 +/- 40.6 minutes, P = 0.177) nor lowered the complication rate (11.1% vs. 9.8% and 6.1%; P = 0.281). SAC had the highest occlusion rate (75.9% vs. 75.8% and 94.0%; P < 0.001) and lowest morbidity rate (0.8% vs. 4.2% and 1.8%; SAC vs. Coil vs. PED; P = 0.099). Ipsilateral multiple aneurysms were more frequently seen in the PED group (33.8% vs. 3.9% and 3.2%; P < 0.001). Procedure duration tended to be lower in the PED group versus the SAC group (122.7 +/- 57.4 vs. 157.5 +/- 22.2 minutes; P = 0.060). For these aneurysms, the PED group had the highest occlusion rate (80.0% vs. 50.0% and 66.7%; P = 0.516).
   CONCLUSIONS: The PED is an alternative treatment for small and tiny aneurysms. However, SAC remains the safest and most efficient treatment modality. The PED should be reserved for ipsilateral multiple aneurysms.

AB OBJECTIVE: Owing to increasing use of Gamma Knife surgery (GKS) for trigeminal neuralgia (TN), physicians are challenged over the problem of choosing an appropriate treatment if GKS fails. The aim of this study was to determine whether microvascular decompression (MVD) is a safe and effective alternative therapy for trigeminal neuralgia in patients with failed GKS.
   METHODS: Between January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2012, data of 32 patients with trigeminal neuralgia who presented with persistent or recurrent pain after GKS and elected to undergo MVD were collected. Clinical characteristics, operative findings, outcomes of MVD, and complications were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Mean interval time between GKS and MVD was 16 +/- 5.64 months (range, 6-27 months). During MVD, the most common offending vessel was the superior cerebellar artery, followed by the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and vertebral artery. Immediately after MVD, 29 patients (90.63%) experienced complete pain relief without medication. At the end of the follow-up period, 25 patients were pain-free without medication.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that MVD is an effective and safe alternative therapy after GKS, although the risk of facial numbness seems higher in patients with a history of GKS than in patients without a history of GKS.

   Graeb Score Intraventricular Hemorrhage
SO WORLD NEUROSURGERY

DT Article
DE External ventricular drain; Intraventricular hemorrhage;
   Ventriculostomy-associated cerebrospinal fluid infection
ID RISK
AB BACKGROUND: Ventriculostomy-associated cerebrospinal fluid infection (VAI) is a major complication limiting the use of an external ventricular drain (EVD) in treating patients with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Risk factors of VAI are still under wide discussion.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 84 patients with IVH who underwent EVD at our center between January 2012 and January 2017. Preoperative clinical parameters, surgeon status, number of catheters and catheter-days, subgaleal tunneling distance, frequency of urokinase flush, and prophylactic antibiotics were compared between the infective and noninfective groups.
   RESULTS: The overall rate of VAI was 31.0%. Univariate analysis showed a higher modified Graeb Score (mGS), higher proportion of bilateral catheters, and longer hospital stay in patients with VAI. Binary logistic analysis of all clinical factors identified high mGS (>= 16) as an independent risk factor for VAI (odds ratio, 3.242; P = 0.026). Among operative and postoperative factors, the use of bilateral catheters significantly contributed to VAI (odds ratio, 4.211; P = 0.031), but a subgroup comparison showed an increased VAI rate only in the low mGS group (mGS < 15). No VAI occurred in patients with a single EVD in the low mGS group. Catheter-days and multiple urokinase flushes were not related to VAI.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a high mGS are vulnerable to VAI. Bilateral EVD may be an appropriate treatment option for patients with a high mGS, but might increase the risk of infection in those with a low mGS.

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study is to analyze the safety and efficacy of a novel technique of computed tomography-guided, fluoroscopy-free vertebroplasty as an adjunct to help prevent proximal junction kyphosis (PJK) in long-segment posterior spinal fusions.
   METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 118 consecutive patients with adult spinal deformity who underwent long-segment fusion with vertebroplasty augmentation from 2013-2016 at a single institution. For each patient, we collected demographics, surgical information, length of stay, discharge disposition, and complications, including reoperation, PJK, and PJK requiring reoperation. We reviewed all postoperative radiographs to assess for cement leakage from vertebroplasty. These patients were compared to a historical control of 253 patients who underwent adult spinal deformity surgery without vertebroplasty augmentation.
   RESULTS: The PJK rate of 14% and the PJK requiring reoperation rate of 3% in the cohort of 118 patients who underwent vertebroplasty-augmented fusion was significantly lower than that of the 253 historical controls at our institution who did not undergo vertebroplasty (40% PJK rate, 17% PJK-rate requiring reoperation; both P < 0.001). After controlling for patient and other surgical factors in multivariate analyses, vertebroplasty was significantly associated with lower rates of PJK and PJK requiring reoperation (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our novel vertebroplasty technique is safe, and it eliminates the need for additional fluoroscopy in cases already using the 0-arm to verify screw placement. In addition, it is an effective technique for reducing PJK in adult spinal deformity surgery compared with historical institutional controls.

AB In recent years, there exists a tendency in research of up-conversion materials to shift excitation from 980 nm to shorter wavelengths. Here, in order to produce up-conversion luminescence emission of GdVO4-based materials under 808 nm excitation, polycrystalline powders of GdVO4:Er3+/Nd3+ and GdVO4:Ho3+/Nd3+ were successfully prepared by a high-temperature solid-state reaction technique. The prepared powders were highly crystalline with a single-phase zircon-type GdVO4 structure and consisted of micrometer-sized irregular spherical particles (2-6 mu m in diameter). In all studied samples, visible up-conversion luminescence was successfully achieved under 808 nm illumination. Near-infrared pumping produced emission bands in the green, yellow orange and green regions of the visible spectrum. The bands in the green and red regions of GdVO4: Er3+/Nd3+ as well as GdVO4:Ho3+/Nd3+ were, respectively, characteristic of Er3+ and Ho3+ ions. The dominant band originating from the (4)G(7/2) -> I-4(11/2) transition in Nd3+ ions was observed around 597 nm in all samples.

AB TlSr2I5: Eu2+ is a newly discovered scintillator that show promising scintillation properties for X- and gamma-ray spectroscopy applications. Two zone vertical Bridgman technique is used for the growth of this scintillator. Luminescence properties of the grown crystals are measured under X-ray excitation at room temperature. Pure and Eu2+ doped crystals contained broad emission bands between 445 and 670 nm peaking at 528 nm and 430-600 nm peaking at 463 nm, respectively. Energy resolution, light yield and decay time profiles are studied under 662 keV gamma-ray excitation using Cs-137 radioactive source. Energy resolution of 4.2% (FWHM) is obtained for 3 mol% Eu2+ doped crystal. For the same sample, light yield of 70,000 ph/MeV is also obtained. Three and two decay constants are observed for the pure and Eu2+ doped samples, respectively at room temperature. Effective Z-number and density are found to be 61 and 5.30 g/cm(3), respectively.

AB We simulated photovoltaic characteristics of single heterojunction solar cell with Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2ZnSnS4 absorber layer numerically using one dimensional solar cell capacitance simulator (SCAPS-1D). n-CdS/ZnO double buffer layer is used for hetrostructure interfaces with the absorber layer. The cell performance is investigated against variation of different material layer properties such as thickness, carrier concentration, and defect density. First, the performance is optimized for the single junction solar cell with Mo as back contact material with ' similar to 5 eV work function. A double junction CZTS/CZTSe tandem cell structure is realized keeping the same material properties as is used in the single CZTS and CZTSe solar cell simulation and flat band condition is considered at the interface for efficient carrier transport under matching current conditions. Tandem cell performance is determined after matching the current condition for top and bottom sub-cells. The CZTS/CZTSe short circuit current density is similar to 20.98 mA/cm(2) for current matched 211.33 nm thick CZTS top cell in conjunction with 2000 nm bottom cell. The maximum efficiency obtained under the flat band condition at the contact is similar to 21.7% with open circuit voltage similar to 1.324 V.

AB Optical waveguides and grating couplers based on polymer nanostructures are now considered as promising technologies for integrated biophotonic sensing systems. Commonly, structuration and patterning of polymers at the submicron scale requires the use of time and cost-consuming equipments such as electron beam lithography. Direct patterning of high refractive index polymer devices on CYTOP is now achievable and provides symmetric waveguides with top water-like claddings. In addition, transparency of polymers makes them suitable for operation in the visible range, being of major interest for biophotonic applications. In this paper, we report on the fabrication process of polymer submicronic single-mode waveguides on CYTOP for visible light operation. Subwavelength grating couplers with a pitch lower than 300 nm were fabricated to couple the input light into a 350 nm square cross-section waveguide. The whole device is imprinted in a single step using soft stamp lithography with a minimal residual layer. Finally, optical characterizations demonstrate a state-of-the-art transmission efficiency (around 1.5%) at the selected operating wavelength of 507 nm for different coupling angles in good agreement with simulations.

AB Nanoparticles (5 nm) and nanorods (2 nm x 15 nm and 4 nm x 20 nm) of monoclinic monazite LaPO4:Eu3+ were prepared by reverse micelle and co-precipitation techniques. Effects of the particle size and surface defects on the intensity of luminescence and the emission spectrum shapes were analyzed by high resolution spectroscopy under laser (266 nm) and X-rays excitation. All synthesized LaPO4:Eu3+ samples showed similar spectral features with characteristic Eu3+ ions emission bands: D-5(0)-> F-7(0) centered at 578.4 nm, magnetic-dipole transition D-5(0)-> F-7(1) at 588-595 nm, electric-dipole transition D-5(0)-> F-7(2) at 611.5-620.5 nm, D-5(0)-> F-7(3) at (648-652 nm) and D-5(0)-> F-7(4) at (684-702.5 nm), with the most dominant electric-dipole D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition. Additionally, the thermally stimulated luminescence was studied for the most dominant peak at 611.5 nm. It was shown that the Eu3+ doping creates traps in all samples. Two prominent and well resolved glow peaks at 58.7 K and 172.3 K were detected for 5 nm nanoparticles, while low-intensity glow-peaks at 212.1 K and 212.2 K were observed in the X-rays irradiated nanorods. Displayed glows could be attributed to free and bound electrons and holes or to the recombination of electrons of ionized oxygen vacancies with photogenerated holes. To obtain information about the processes and specific defect type it is necessary to carry out additional analysis for all synthesized samples. The glow curves were analyzed and trap parameters were estimated and discussed throughout the paper.

AB Tb3+/Eu3+ single and co-doped CaLaAlO4 (CLA) phosphors were successfully prepared by solution combustion route. The luminescence properties of Tb3+ and Eu3+, and the energy transfer (ET) from Tb3+ to Eu3+ were investigated. Microstructures are analyzed by X-ray diffraction and high-resolution scanning electron microscope (SEM) experiments. The sample shows single tetragonal structure. Under the excitation of 260 rim, CLA:Tb3+, Eu3+ phosphors exhibited green emission corresponding to the f-f transition of Tb3+ ions and red emission bands corresponding to the f-f transition of Eu3+ ions, respectively. With appropriate tuning of the Tb3+/Eu3+ ratio, tunable photoluminescence emission from blue-green to yellow and red is obtained in Tb3+ and Eu3+ co-doped CLA phosphors and emission spectrum covers the entire visible light region with comparable intensity, resulting in white emission. Moreover, the CLA:0.01 Tb3+, 0.02 Eu3+ assembly have Commission International del'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates x = 0.3277 and y = 0.3370, which is close to the standard white-light color (x = 0.333 and y = 0.333), demonstrating its great potentials as single-component (single-phase) phosphors for white light emission. The maximum ET efficiency is found to be 63.77% for CLA:0.01 Tb3+ 0.03 Eu3+ phosphor.

AB Uranium doped yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) transparent ceramic with Ca2+ as charge compensator and sintering aid was firstly fabricated by vacuum sintering technique using the co-precipitation synthesis of raw powders. The structural, optical spectral and luminescence properties of the U:YAG ceramic have been investigated in detail. The experimental results show that uranium doped in YAG matrix has not changed the crystal structure. Vacuum sintering 15 h in 1800 degrees C, the sample has a pore-free structure with an average grain size of about 3.5 mu m, and in-line transmittance reaches up to 78% in the visible wavelength region. The excitation spectrum showed a sharp band around 458 nm, and the emission spectrum revealed the intense green emission located at 520 nm. Further, with respect to the shape of emission band and luminescence color, uranium was inferred to exist as uranate ion (UO66-) in the YAG host where it replaces the 'Y' ions at dodecahedral site with surrounding defect centers created for charge compensation.

AB Scintillation and dosimetric properties of (LiF)-Li-6-CaF2 eutectic composites doped with different concentrations of Ce (0, 0.1 and 0.5%) were investigated. The Ce-doped samples showed scintillation due to the 5 d-4f transitions of Ce3+ and self-trapped excitons (STE) at 320-340 and 300 nm, respectively. Furthermore, the Ce-doped samples exhibited thermally-stimulated luminescence (TSL) with glow peaks around 150 degrees C after X-ray irradiation of 1000 mGy. The TSL response of the 0.5% Ce-doped sample increased monotonically with X-ray dose over a dose range of 0.1-1000 mGy. Moreover, the Ce-doped samples showed optically-stimulated luminescence (OSL) with peaks at 320-340 nm due to the 5 d-4f transitions of Ce3+ under 630 nm stimulation light after X-ray irradiation of 1000 mGy.

AB Optimization of photoluminescence intensity of green-emitting InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells deposited on a template consisting of low-indium-content short-period superlattice was studied by growing the structures at different temperatures for active layer and template. The importance of carrier localization is revealed. The temperatures for growing the template and the active layer predominantly influence large-scale and small-scale potential fluctuations experienced by nonequilibrium carriers, respectively, while the difference between the temperatures impacts the formation of nonradiative recombination centers, and has to be maintained small to ensure high photoluminescence intensity.

AB In this work, the effects of the hydrogenic impurity, electric and magnetic fields on the optical absorption of a typical GaAs/AlGaAs ring-shaped elliptical quantum dot are investigated. Energy eigenvalues and wave functions are calculated using the three-dimensional finite element method, and optical absorption is obtained using the density matrix approach. For the impurity located at the center of the quantum dot, results show that the optical absorption increases (decreases) with increasing electric (magnetic) field. Results also indicate that the off-center hydrogenic impurity considerably reduces the optical absorption.

AB We report on the spectroscopic investigation of Er3+ doped BaF2 single crystals. High-quality crystals have been gown by the Bridgman-Stockbarger pulling technique. The room temperature absorption, excitation, emission and fluorescence decay spectra of the luminescent Er3+ ions inserted in BaF2 fluoride single crystals have been investigated. Using the Judd-Ofelt (JO) theory, the intensity parameters of Er3+ ions have been calculated to be Omega(2) = 0.949 x 10(-20) cm(2), Omega(4) = 0.975 x 10(-20) cm(2) and Omega(6) = 1.258 x 10(-20) cm(2). These parameters were then used to calculate the radiative transition probabilities (A(JJ')), branching ratios (beta JJ') and radiative lifetimes (tau(rad) ) of the main laser emitting levels of Er3+ ions. The obtained spectroscopic properties are compared to those of Er3+ transitions in other fluoride and oxide hosts. The excitation spectrum in the UV-Visible spectral range is very close to the absorption spectrum indicating that all observed absorption levels can excite the Erbium green emission. The emission spectrum is mainly dominated by the green emission alongside a weak red emission. For the main transitions, there is a good agreement between the emission spectrum and the spontaneous emission probabilities given by the JO analysis. Using the Fuchtbauer-Ladenburg method, the emission cross-section of the three main visible emission were determined in addition to other important laser parameters such radiative quantum efficiency and optical gain.

AB Fully amorphous lead borate glasses triply doped with Dy3+/Tb3+/Eu3+ were synthesized and next studied using optical spectroscopy. The characteristic luminescence bands originating to electronic transitions of Dy3+ / Tb3+/Eu3+ ions were observed under direct excitation of Dy3+. Moreover, the influence of concentration of rare earth ions on spectroscopic properties of lead borate glasses was examined. The obtained experimental results indicate that energy transfer between these rare earth ions is possible. From the emission spectra, the Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity coordinates (x, y) are calculated in relation to potential application lead borate glasses for white light emitting devices. It has been proved that our glass systems exhibit warm white emission originating from the simultaneous generation of several bands of Dy3+, Tb3+, Eu3+ under the UV-visible light excitation.

AB We investigate in this work Terahertz metamaterial resonators which can provide highly sub-wavelength confinement of the electromagnetic field. We demonstrate that a metamaterial behavior can be realized from the proposed terahertz metamaterial called TZ-shaped metamaterial. Moreover, a new structure of wideband loop antenna loaded with negative permeability called meta-material loop antenna is proposed and detailed. Therefore, a negative refractive index, permittivity and permeability are obtained at the resonant frequency for a proposed metamaterial structure. To enhance the antenna performances in terms of return loss, directivity, gain and radiation efficiency, an effective approach based on metasurface cavity is presented. This is achieved by applying a flat metasurface on the top of the antenna based on TZ-shaped metamaterial resonator array which increase the directivity and the gain to be 5.71 dBi and 5.39 dBi respectively and to enhance the radiation efficiency to be 93 %.

AB A simple quinoline-based fluorescent chemosensor 1 capable of detecting Ag+ ion in aqueous media was developed. Chemosensor 1 exhibits high selectivity and sensitivity toward Ag+ ion as fluorescence off-on behavior in HEPES buffered MeOH-H2O (1:1, (v/v) HEPES = 50 mM, pH = 7.4) solution. Chemosensor 1 binds with Ag+ ion through intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT), resulting in enhancement and quenching of peaks demarcated by isoemissive point. The practical application of chemosensor 1 in bio imaging and water studies have been demonstrated in this study.

ID LOW-COST
AB Dye-sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) are suitable alternatives for the conventional silicon based solar cells because of their low cost of production, ease of availability of raw materials required for production. In this study a comparative physical performance analysis has been done on three such dye-sensitized solar cells having three different dyes: Red Colloid Dye (Fe (OH)(3) + FeCl3 [Fe(OH)(3)] Fe-3(+)), Prussian blue {KFe3[Fe-2(CN)(6)]} and Green Dye from Chlorophyll (C55H72O5N4Mg) extracted from spinach leaves. In this experiment the preparation of red dye and its use in the solar cell in the form of colloid small particles is unique and noble. The substrates used for deposition of semiconductor film and making of counter electrodes were Indium doped Tin-Oxide (ITO) glass having a surface resistance of 30 Omega/cm(2). Titanium di-oxide (TiO2) is used because of wide band-gap semiconductor material for providing the charge transport. Counter electrodes with carbon coating have been used in this work. A redox iodide electrolyte solution has been used as the electron mediator or replenishes dyes or sensitizers. After performing the electrical characterization, fill-factors having values of 40.65%, 69.55% and 25.83% were calculated for the DSSCs with red, blue and green dyes, respectively. The Dyesensitized Solar cell with Prussian blue as the sensitizer showed the best electrical performance with respect to other two Dyesensitized Solar cells and previously published authors' solar cells with same colour of dye.

AB A prominent green emitting anhydrous (Znq(2))(4) tetramer phosphor has been produced by the sublimation in Ar-atmosphere from dihydrated Znq(2). The dihydrated Znq 2 was synthesized by the co-precipitation method under normal atmospheric condition. Structural changes which are responsible for change in their photo-physical properties have been confirmed by the XRD, FTIR, NMR analysis and relative stability by the TGA/DTA analysis. The dependence of UV-visible absorption spectrum, in different acidic and basic mediums at different concentrations on the alteration of phase from dihydrated Znq(2) to anhydrous (Znq(2))(4) tetramer leading to the change in the band gap, has been noted. A photoluminescence spectrum of solid and of solution state and structural dependence on emission and excitation wavelength, revealing the modification in the structure, is responsible for a prominent green emission. Solvato-chromatic effect on PL emission leading to blue shift by the addition of acidic solvents and a red shift by basic solvents has also been reported. The structural formation and experimental band gap energy information has been supported by the quantum chemical calculations using DFT Computational study. We conclude from the study that the produced anhydrous (Znq(2))(4) tetramer phosphor has a potential application as a prominent green dopant in OLEDs including indoor lighting. Additionally, this study gives an insight into the spectroscopy of Zinc (II) quinolate complex.

ID CHITINASE; VECTORS; VACCINE; SYSTEM
AB Baculovirus-insect cell expression system has become one of the most widely used eukaryotic expression systems for heterologous protein production in many laboratories. The availability of robust insect cell lines, serum-free media, a range of vectors and commercially-packaged kits have supported the demand for maximizing the exploitation of the baculovirus-insect cell expression system. Naturally, this resulted in varied strategies adopted by different laboratories to optimize protein production. Most laboratories have preference in using either the E. coli transposition-based recombination bacmid technology (e.g. Bac-to-Bac((R)))or homologous recombination transfection within insect cells (e.g. flashBAC (TM)). Limited data is presented in the literature to benchmark the protocols used for these baculovirus vectors to facilitate the selection of a system for optimal production of target proteins. Taking advantage of the Protein Production and Purification Partnership in Europe (P4EU) scientific network, a benchmarking initiative was designed to compare the diverse protocols established in thirteen individual laboratories. This benchmarking initiative compared the expression of four selected intracellular proteins (mouse Dicer-2, 204kDa; human ABL1 wildtype, 126kDa; human FMRP, 68 kDa; viral vNSl-Hl, 76kDa). Here, we present the expression and purification results on these proteins and highlight the significant differences in expression yields obtained using different commercially-packaged baculovirus vectors. The highest expression level for difficult-to-express intracellular protein candidates were observed with the EmBacY baculovirus vector system.

AB SEFIR domain-containing proteins are crucial for mammalian adaptive immunity. As a unique intracellular signaling domain, the SEFIR-SEFIR interactions mediate physical protein-protein interactions in the immune signaling network, especially the IL-17- and IL-25-mediated pathways. However, due to the lack of structural information, the detailed molecular mechanism for SEFIR-SEFIR assembly remains unclear. In the present study, we solved the crystal structures of a prokaryotic SEFIR domain from Bacillus cereus F65185 (BcSEFIR), where the SEFIR domain is located at the N terminus. The structure of BcSEFIR revealed two radically distinct SEFIR-SEFIR interaction modes. In the asymmetric form, the C-terminal tail of one SEFIR binds to the helix alpha A and beta B-alpha B' segment of the other one, while in the symmetric form, the helices eta C and alpha E and the DE-segment compose the inter-protomer interface. The C-terminal tail of BcSEFIR, critical for asymmetric interaction, is highly conserved among the SEFIR domains of Act1 orthologs from different species, in particular three absolutely conserved residues that constitute an EXXXXPP motif. In the symmetric interaction mode, the most significant contacts made by residues on helix alpha E are highly conserved in Act1 SEFIR domains, constituted an RLI/LXE motif. The two novel SEFIR-SEFIR interaction modes might explain the structural basis for SEFIR domain-mediated complex assembly in signaling pathways.

AB Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) has become an invaluable tool for structural biology. Over the past decade, the advent of direct electron detectors and automated data acquisition has established cryo-EM as a central method in structural biology. However, challenges remain in the reliable and efficient preparation of samples in a manner which is compatible with high time resolution. The delivery of sample onto the grid is recognized as a critical step in the workflow as it is a source of variability and loss of material due to the blotting which is usually required. Here, we present a method for sample delivery and plunge freezing based on the use of Surface Acoustic Waves to deploy 6-8 mu m droplets to the EM grid. This method minimises the sample dead volume and ensures vitrification within 52.6 ms from the moment the sample leaves the microfluidics chip. We demonstrate a working protocol to minimize the atomised volume and apply it to plunge freeze three different samples and provide proof that no damage occurs due to the interaction between the sample and the acoustic waves.

AB HIV-1 Rev mediates the nuclear export of unspliced and partially-spliced viral transcripts for the production of progeny genomes and structural proteins. In this process, four (or more) copies of Rev assemble onto a highly-structured 351-nt region in such viral transcripts, the Rev response element (RRE). How this occurs is not known. The Rev assembly domain has a helical-hairpin structure which associates through three (A-A, B-B and C-C) interfaces. The RRE has the topology of an upper-case letter A, with the two known Rev binding sites mapping onto the legs of the A. We have determined a crystal structure for the Rev assembly domain at 2.25 angstrom resolution, without resort to either mutations or chaperones. It shows that B-B dimers adopt an arrangement reversed relative to that previously reported, and join through a C-C interface to form tetramers. The new subunit arrangement shows how four Rev molecules can assemble on the two sites on the RRE to form the specificity checkpoint, and how further copies add through A-A interactions. Residues at the C-C interface, specifically the Pro31-Trp45 axis, are a potential target for intervention.

AB Sorbitol-6-phosphate 2-dehydrogenases (S6PDH) catalyze the interconversion of D-sorbitol 6-phosphate to D-fructose 6-phosphate. In the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora the S6PDH SrlD is used by the bacterium to utilize sorbitol, which is used for carbohydrate transport in the host plants belonging to the Amygdaloideae subfamily (e.g., apple, pear, and quince). We have determined the crystal structure of S6PDH SrlD at 1.84 angstrom resolution, which is the first structure of an EC 1.1.1.140 enzyme. Kinetic data show that SrlD is much faster at oxidizing D-sorbitol 6-phosphate than in reducing D-fructose 6-phosphate, however, equilibrium analysis revealed that only part of the D-sorbitol 6-phosphate present in the in vitro environment is converted into D-fructose 6-phosphate. The comparison of the structures of SrlD and Rhodobacter sphaeroides sorbitol dehydrogenase showed that the tetrameric quaternary structure, the catalytic residues and a conserved aspartate residue that confers specificity for NAD(+) over NADP(+) are preserved.
   Analysis of the SrlD cofactor and substrate binding sites identified residues important for the formation of the complex with cofactor and substrate and in particular the role of Lys42 in selectivity towards the phosphosubstrate. The comparison of SrlD backbone with the backbone of 302 short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases showed the conservation of the protein core and identified the variable parts. The SrlD sequence was compared with 500 S6PDH sequences selected by homology revealing that the C-terminal part is more conserved than the N-terminal, the consensus of the catalytic tetrad (Y[SN]AGXA) and a not previously described consensus for the NAD(H) binding.

AB 2D electron crystallography can be used to study small membrane proteins in their native environment. Obtaining highly ordered 2D crystals is difficult and time-consuming. However, 2D crystals diffracting to only 10-12 angstrom can be prepared relatively conveniently in most cases. We have developed image-processing algorithms allowing to generate a high resolution 3D structure from cryo-electron crystallography images of badly ordered crystals. These include movie-mode unbending, refinement over sub-tiles of the images in order to locally refine the sample tilt geometry, implementation of different CTF correction schemes, and an iterative method to apply known constraints in the real and reciprocal space to approximate amplitudes and phases in the so-called missing cone regions. These algorithms applied to a dataset of the potassium channel MloK1 show significant resolution improvements to better than 5 angstrom.

AB Ketoreductase (KR) domains of modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) control the stereochemistry of C2 methyl and C3 hydroxyl substituents of polyketide intermediates. To understand the molecular basis of stereocontrol exerted by KRs, the crystal structure of a KR from the second module of the amphotericin PKS (AmpKR2) complexed with NADP(+) and 2-methyl-3-oxopentanoyl-pantetheine was solved. This first ternary structure provides direct evidence to the hypothesis that a substrate enters into the active site of an A-type KR from the side opposite the coenzyme to generate an L-hydroxyl substituent. A comparison with the ternary complex of a G355T/Q364H mutant sheds light on the structural basis for stereospecificity toward the substrate C2 methyl substituent. Functional assays suggest the pantetheine handle shows obvious influence on the catalytic efficiency and the stereochemical outcome. Together, these findings extend our current understanding of the stereochemical control of PKS KR domains.

AB Avian eggshell is a typical bio-engineered ceramics characterized by layer structures. These layers are categorized mainly by the form of crystalline calcite. Whether there exist other layer structures, how the membrane layer is transformed to the carbonate one, what form the carbonate takes after the transition. These questions remain to be clarified. Here we examine the eggshell of chicken Gallus domesticus by optical microscope, scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope. We find that there exists another layer structure defined by variation of organic matrices. The transition from the membrane to the mammillary cones is implemented through the calcium reserve assemblies or the mammillary cores. The integrity of the transitional structure was weakens as the reserved calcium is displaced, and loses completely in about 10 days of incubation. As the first deposited carbonate layer after the transition, the mammillary cones comprise amorphous calcium carbonate and clusters/assemblies of calcite crystallites the size about a nanometer, plus bubble pores extending preferentially in the lateral direction. Our results provide new insights into the structure and component of the avian eggshell, and may help decipher the constitution of the bio-ceramics in the perspective of material science.

AB Myelin-gene regulatory factor (MYRF) is a membrane-bound transcription factors, which is responsible for the differentiation of oligodendrocytes and myelination of central nervous system. Followed by a self-cleavage by the intramolecular chaperone auto-processing (ICA) domain, DNA-binding domain (DBD) of MYRF is released from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and was then translocated to the nucleus to regulate gene expression. In present work, we have solved the crystal structure of the human MYRF-DBD to 1.85-angstrom resolution. It exhibits a typical s-type Ig-fold and packs as symmetric trimeric form in the crystal via hydrogen-bond networks in three regions. Accordingly, we identified a couple of key residues on MYRF-DBD, which might play important roles in DNA-binding, in particular Arg521 on its C-terminal tail. The R521A mutant of DBD showed only 17% affinity to dsDNA targets compared to wild-type DBD. Then we built a plausible protein-DNA binding model of MYRF-DBD, which will help to elucidate its mechanism in DNA-binding and transcriptional regulation.

AB Domain of unknown function 61 (DUF61) family proteins widely exist in archaea and the genes of DUF61 proteins in crenarchaea are in an operon containing two genes of box C/D RNA protein complexes. Here we report the solution NMR structure of DUF61 family member protein SS00941, from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus. SSO0941 has a rigid core structure and flexible N- and C-terminal regions as well as a negatively-charged independent C-terminal helix. The core structure consists of N- and C-terminal subdomains, in which the C-terminal subdomain shows significant structural similarity with several nucleic acid binding proteins. The structure of SSO0941 is the first representative structure of DUF61 family proteins.

AB Objectives: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is a sensory-motor disorder which produces sleep disturbance. Using data from a large clinical trial of gabapentin enacarbil (GEn) we sought to assess the ability of baseline, and changes from baseline, in clinical trial endpoints to predict treatment response.
   Methods: Data were derived from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover polysomnography study of gabapentin enacarbil 1200 mg (n = 121) or placebo (n = 123). Efficacy evaluations included: sleep measures from polysomnography, subjective sleep measures, Suggested Immobilization Test (SIT) measures, and International Restless Legs Severity Scale (IRLS) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I). Correlations were evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Predictors of treatment response were separately assessed for GEn and placebo using categorical IRLS and CGI-I outcomes. Stepwise logistic regression models ascertained which combination of baseline and change from baseline variables predicted response.
   Results: Moderate to large correlations were observed between changes in the IRLS and changes in subjective sleep for both GEn and placebo, substantially larger for GEn than placebo. Small to moderate correlations were present between the change in IRLS and the change in SIT-discomfort for both GEn and placebo. In the stepwise regression, for both GEn and placebo, baseline and change from baseline SIT discomfort, as well as change in sleep quality, were strong predictors of response.
   Conclusions: Changes in sleep quality, and baseline and changes in SIT discomfort were prominent predictors of treatment response for GEn and placebo. Predictors of treatment response may allow for more targeted enrollment in future clinical trials and may provide insights into the efficacy of RLS treatments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize the neuropsychological features of a representative sample of Sleep-related Hypermotor Epilepsy (SHE) patients and to highlight clinical associations.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included 60 consecutive patients with video/video-electroencephalography-documented SHE. All were assessed by measures of intelligence. Individuals with normal scores underwent a standardized battery of tests. The Fisher exact test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test for statistical analysis.
   Results: Mean total IQ was 96.96 +/- 21.50, with significant differences between verbal and performance scores (p < 0.0001). Nine patients (15%) had intellectual disability (ID)/cognitive deterioration. Of the 49 assessed by the extensive battery, 23 (46.9%) showed deficits in at least one test evaluating phonemic fluency (24.5%), memory (24.5%), inhibitory control (22.4%), or working memory (10.2%). Patients with mutations in SHE genes had lower IQ than patients without mutations, irrespective of the specific gene (p = 0.0176). Similarly, pathological neurological examination (NE) and "any underlying brain disorder" (at least one among pathological NE, abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging findings, perinatal insult) were associated with ID (p = 0.029, p = 0.036). A higher seizure frequency at last assessment and poor prognosis correlated with worse scores in visuo-spatial memory (p = 0.038, p = 0.040) and visuo-spatial abilities (p = 0.016). Status epilepticus (p = 0.035), poor response to antiepileptic drugs (p = 0.033), and poor prognosis (p = 0.020) correlated with lower shifting abilities, whereas bilateral convulsive seizures correlated with worse working memory (p = 0.049).
   Conclusion: In all, 53.3% of SHE patients had neuropsychological deficits. The profile of impairment showed worse verbal IQ as well as deficits in extrafrontal and selective frontal functions. Our data support the contribution of genetics in ID by different biological mechanisms. Variables of clinical severity affect memory and executive functioning. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Sleep problems are commonly reported in seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the specific characteristics of sleep difficulties differ. Frequent sleep problems in MDD are insomnia and night awakenings, whereas SAD patients complain of hypersomnia and daytime sleepiness. No previous studies have reported differences in sleep functioning between these two disorders.
   Methods: We interviewed 4554 subjects from the Health 2011 survey and included 4153 individuals in this study. We selected participants who fulfilled the criteria for SAD (n = 223), nonseasonal-MDD (n = 238), SAD + MDD (n = 65), and controls (n = 3627). They completed the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Munich version (M-CIDI), the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ), The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the EuroQoL (EQ-5), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and several questions about sleeping, based on the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire (BNSQ).
   Results: We found Significant differences between groups for "enough sleep", "breathing interruptions during sleep", "tiredness during the day", and "sleeping difficulties". Controls reported better functioning in all sleep variables. SAD + MDD individuals showed more problems in "enough sleep" than SAD, more "breathing interruptions during sleep" than SAD and nonseasonal-MDD, felt more "tired during the day" than SAD and nonseasonal-MDD, and reported more "sleeping difficulties" than SAD and nonseasonal-MDD. Finally, nonseasonal-MDD individuals felt more "tired during the day" than SAD.
   Conclusion: Individuals with SAD + MDD show generalized sleeping problems. However, when SAD and nonseasonal-MDD appear separately, similar sleep functioning is observed. Nonseasonal-MDD subjects report to be more tired during the day than SAD. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective/Background: Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) or spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is the most common type of autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). Sleep disorders have been described as frequent non-motor symptoms in MJD, and with marked impairment on quality of life. However, few studies have evaluated the frequency and characteristics of sleep apnea in MJD.
   Patients/Methods: This study analyzed the prevalence of sleep apnea in 47 patients with MJD by using polysomnography. Clinical variables such as age, age at onset of symptoms, duration of symptoms (at time of evaluation), body index mass, ataxia scales severity and CAG repeat length were compared with polysomnographic findings.
   Results: Thirty four percent of MJD patients had OSAS, and 42.5% had excessive daytime somnolence. There were no differences considering ataxia severity, CAG repetition length or other clinical variable.
   Conclusions: Patients with MJD have high frequency of obstructive sleep apnea, and this sleep disorder is not correlated with ataxia severity, CAG repetition length or other clinical variable. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To explore the radiological characteristics of the upper respiratory tract and their correlations with obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) in patients with acromegaly.
   Methods: Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed in untreated patients with acromegaly placed in straight (SHP) and extended head positions (EHP). Overnight polysomnography was performed to evaluate OSAHS, and the apnoea/hypopnea index (AHI) was measured.
   Results: According to the CT findings, a thicker soft palate (1.24 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.03 +/- 0.22 cm, p = 0.024), larger soft palate cross-sectional area (5.15 +/- 1.21 vs. 4.06 +/- 1.09 cm(2), p = 0.027), and thicker lateral pharyngeal wall (1.01 +/- 0.25 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.14 cm, p = 0.015) were observed in patients with acromegaly who presented with OSAHS compared with patients without OSAHS. Additionally, the maximal transverse diameter (1.87 +/- 0.40 vs. 2.31 +/- 0.44 cm, p = 0.015) and cross-sectional area (1.98 +/- 0.46 vs. 2.74 +/- 1.01 cm 2 , p = 0.032) of the airway were decreased in the soft palate plane in patients with OSAHS. The AHI was positively correlated with the thickness of the soft palate and lateral pharyngeal wall but negatively correlated with the maximal transverse diameter and cross-sectional area of the airway in the soft palate plane.
   Conclusions: Airway stenosis and pharyngeal tissue hypertrophy are typical characteristics of changes in the structure of the upper respiratory tract in patients with acromegaly who present with OSAHS. AHI is a predictor of the severity of the respiratory tract changes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Although afternoon napping is very common, particularly in China, there are limited data regarding the potential health effects of afternoon napping during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes. We aimed to investigate the relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and low birth weight (LBW).
   Methods: A total of 10,111 women aged 15-50 years were recruited from the ongoing Healthy Baby Cohort study in China, in 2012-2014. Information on sleep habits during pregnancy was obtained by questionnaires at the time of institutional delivery. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
   Results: Compared with women who reported no napping, the multivariate-adjusted ORs for LBW were 0.83 (95% CI 0.58-1.18) and 0.61 (0.44-0.83) for those who reported <= 1 h and >1 h of napping, respectively (P for trend <0.001). LBW risk reached a threshold at approximately 1.5 h of afternoon napping. The inverse relationship between afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW was stronger among women with lower educational level (P for interaction = 0.011). For frequency of afternoon napping, the multivariate analysis suggested a significant inverse association between LBW and napping 5-7 days/week (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50-0.92).
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the association between afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping during late pregnancy and LBW risk. Our findings suggest that appropriate afternoon napping and frequency of afternoon napping for pregnant women might reduce the risk of LBW. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Study objectives: Previous studies have performed cross-cultural comparisons of differences in childhood sleep problems between Asian and Western countries. However, whether such differences can be observed among Asian countries remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate differences in the pattern of sleep problems between Japanese and Chinese preschoolers.
   Methods: Data were collected from one city in Japan and 10 cities in China. The present study recruited 438 Japanese and 1020 Chinese preschoolers aged four and five years. Sleep problems and patterns were assessed on the basis of parental reports using the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ).
   Results: Analysis of covariance revealed no significant difference in total CSHQ scores between Japanese and Chinese preschoolers, thus indicating that the total severity of sleep problems did not differ between the groups. Japanese preschoolers exhibited higher scores on the bedtime resistance subscale of the CSHQ than Chinese preschoolers. Conversely, Chinese preschoolers exhibited higher subscale scores for night wakings and sleep-disordered breathing. In addition, Japanese preschoolers exhibited earlier bedtimes and wake times and shorter total sleep times than Chinese preschoolers.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the patterns of sleep problems in preschoolers differ between Japan and China and that such differences may be due to differences in cosleeping practices, bedtime routines, and/or environmental conditions. Thus, investigators studying sleep in preschoolers should consider regional differences in the pattern of sleep problems, even among Asian countries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Night eating syndrome (NES) involves reduced feeding during the day and evening hyperphagia sometimes accompanied by frequent nocturnal awakenings with conscious episodes of compulsive ingestion of food. Previously, NES has not been evaluated in bipolar disorder (BD). The objective of this study was to identify NES in euthymic BD patients.
   Patients/Methods: Eighty BD patients and 40 controls were examined using the Night Eating Questionnaire, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and Anxiety, Young Mania Rating Scale, Functioning Assessment Short-Test and International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), daytime sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale), severity of insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index) and morning-evening preference (Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire) were also evaluated.
   Results: BD patients presented NES in 8.8% while the controls showed no NES. Patients with and without NES were not different with respect to gender, disease duration, smoking, heavy drinking, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio and neck circumference. BD patients with NES scored higher for functioning as well as for the following specific components: occupational functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships and leisure time. They also had more anxiety, higher insomnia severity and worse sleep quality. Furthermore, BD patients with NES were more evening type.
   Conclusion: NES occurs more frequently in BD patients than in controls. BD patients with NES present more disease-related manifestations such as more anxiety, poorer functioning and worse sleep parameters. Patients with NES were more evening type. We speculate whether changing circadian preference in these patients can reduce NES. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Severe chronic vascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of co-morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2). Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) has been linked to CVD in the general population due to enhanced sympathetic activation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, and hypertension; however data for DM2 patients is scarce. Therefore, the aim of the present analysis to assess whether SDB is associated with CVD in patients with DM2, independent of other known associated factors.
   Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data of 679 patients with DM2 from the DIACORE-SDB sub-study for association of SDB with CVD. SDB was assessed with a validated 2-channel ambulatory monitoring device. CVD was ascertained as a previous diagnosis of peripheral artery disease (PAD), coronary artery disease (CAD), or stroke via medical records and general practitioners.
   Results: Of the analyzed 679 patients, 228 (34%) had SDB (respiratory event index [REI] >= 15/hour); and were significantly more often affected by CVD than patients without SDB (38% vs. 23%, p < 0.01; PAD 7% vs. 2%, p = 0.01; CAD 27% vs. 18%, p = 0.01; stroke 11% vs. 6%, p = 0.07). Regression analysis accounting for known modulators of CVD, such as age, body-mass index, systolic blood pressure, duration of DM2, HbA1c, smoking status, and low-density lipoprotein showed that the REI was independently associated with CVD (OR 1.099 per 5 REI points; 95%-CI = [1.024, 1.179]).
   Conclusions: In patients with DM2, SDB is significantly associated with CVD, independent of other known modulators of atherosclerosis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Sympathetic hyperactivity and poor sleep quality are reported in myocardial infarction (MI) patients and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) can improve long-term survival in these patients. We aimed to evaluate ACEI effects on cardiac autonomic activity (CAA) and disordered sleep patterns in ambulatory rats after MI.
   Methods: Polysomnographic recording was performed in sham (n = 8) and MI (n = 9) male rats during normal daytime sleep before and after captopril treatment. Spectral analyses of the electroencephalogram and electromyogram were evaluated to define active waking (AW), quiet sleep (QS), and paradoxical sleep (PS). Central sleep apnea (CSA) events were measured by analyzing the electromyogram of the diaphragm. CAA was measured by power spectrum analyses of heart rate variability (HRV).
   Results: In the MI group, there was a higher low frequency/high frequency ratio during sleep, which reduced significantly after captopril treatment, especially at the QS stage compared to that before captopril treatment. The frequency of sleep interruption was higher in the MI group than the sham group. Increased AW and PS, and decreased QS times were noted in the MI group compared to the sham group. These changes were restored to baseline after captopril treatment in the MI group. CSA events were significantly increased in the MI group, and were restored to the normal level after captopril treatment.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrate significant sleep fragmentation with sympathetic hyperactivity after MI, and that captopril restores the autonomic dysfunction and sleep disorder. These findings suggest that ACEI improved sleep-related respiration disorder after MI by restoring autonomic homeostasis, and provide a hypothesis generating for future studies in humans.

   learning; Classification
ID OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP-APNEA; TRANSDUCER SYSTEM; PRESSURE; RESISTANCE;
   CHILDREN; MEN; WOMEN; AREA
AB Background: Inspiratory flow limitation is a breathing pattern during sleep caused by upper airway (UA) narrowing that occurs during snoring and various degrees of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Clinical examination of flow limitation relies on identifying patterns of airflow contour, however this process is subjective and lacks physiological evidence of UA narrowing. Our objective is to derive the temporal features of nasal airflow contour that characterize flow limitation. The features that correlate with UA narrowing can be used to develop machine learning classifiers to detect flow limitation with physiological support.
   Methods: Sixteen healthy adult men underwent full daytime polysomnography where the nasal airflow was recorded. Before and after sleep, we measured UA anatomical parameters including neck circumference (NC) and upper-airway cross-sectional area (UA-XSA). We extracted various temporal features of airflow and investigated their relationships with the UA anatomical parameters.
   Results: We found that three features were correlated with the anatomical parameters associated with UA narrowing: deviation index vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.67, p = 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.69, p < 0.01), peak amplitude variability vs. ANC (r = 0.74, p < 0.01) and peak number vs. baseline UA-XSA (r = -0.54, p = 0.04).
   Conclusions: Temporal features of airflow were associated with UA narrowing. Future studies could utilize the features to develop classifiers to detect flow limitation and assess the severity of breathing disorders during sleep in high-risk populations such as pregnant women and children.

AB Background and objectives: Augmentation can occur frequently in restless legs syndrome (RLS) patients treated with dopaminergic agents. Video-polysomnographic (PSG) data from augmented RLS patients are scant. The aim of this study was to evaluate PSG findings in augmented RLS patients and compare them with those of non-augmented RLS patients.
   Patients and methods: Valid PSG data were analyzed from 99 augmented and 84 non-augmented RLS inpatients who underwent one night PSG.
   Results: Both patient groups showed a high subjective burden of RLS symptoms. The mean scores on the International RLS Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) were significantly higher in the group with augmentation than in the group without. The periodic leg movement index (PLMI) was increased in both groups, mostly on account of the PLM in wakefulness (PLMW). Both groups presented a reduced sleep efficiency and an increased sleep latency. The levodopa equivalent dose (LED) was significantly higher in the augmented group.
   Conclusions: Our study confirms that RLS patients with augmentation have disturbed sleep due to high amount of leg movements and fragmented sleep. Overall, however, polysomnographic characteristics were not different between insufficiently treated RLS and severely augmented RLS patients, implying that augmentation could represent a severe form of RLS and not a different phenomenon.

AB Objectives: A number of reports exist regarding the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to manage obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) in children, which we term 'conventional CPAP'. In contrast, there are few reports of home CPAP use for other indications, which we have grouped under the term 'cardiopulmonary'. The aims of this study were to (1) document cardiopulmonary indications for CPAP use in a cohort of infants and children, and (2) evaluate its effectiveness in this group.
   Methods: Hospital records were reviewed for 645 patients who were commenced on long-term CPAP over a 10-year period at a single-tertiary hospital (Children's Hospital at Westmead). This study evaluated the group where the primary indication for CPAP was not OSA ('cardiopulmonary CPAP'). Data evaluated included: demographics, diagnoses, indications for CPAP, hours of use (compliance) and sleep study results at baseline and on CPAP.
   Results: Of 645 children, 148 (23%) used home CPAP for cardiopulmonary indications; and 130 (87.8%) of these were included. For this group, mean age at CPAP initiation was 18.6 +/- 33.6 months (range one week to 16.8 years). Cardiopulmonary indications for CPAP use included: primary airway diseases 65 (50%), chronic lung diseases 33 (25.4%), congenital heart disease (CHD) 20 (15.4%), and both CHD and airway malacia 12 (9.2%). All sleep study variables improved on CPAP relative to the diagnostic sleep study (p < 0.0001), including reduced respiratory rate with CPAP use (p < 0.0001). CPAP was well tolerated (>4 h/night).
   Conclusions: Interstitial lung diseases and other cardiorespiratory disorders, often of congenital origin, can be effectively treated with home CPAP whether they are associated with OSA or not. Sleep studies demonstrated improved gas exchange, sleep and reduced work of breathing with CPAP use. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Childhood sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) symptoms may comprise multiple phenotypes depending on craniofacial anatomy, tonsil and adenoid growth, body habitus, and rhinitis symptoms. The primary objective of this study is to identify and characterize the different SDB phenotypes to two years of age.
   Methods: Data from 770 infants in the Edmonton sub-cohort of the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Study (CHILD) were analyzed to identify SDB phenotypes based on age of onset and duration of symptoms. Parents completed the 22-item sleep-related breathing disorder (SRBD) scale. Children with a SRBD ratio greater than 0.33 were considered positive for SDB at each quarterly assessment between three months and two years. The STATA Proc trajectory extension identified SDB phenotypes based on their age of onset and duration of symptoms and attributed the percentage chance of a participant being assigned to each phenotype. Multivariate linear regression identified factors associated with increased risk of being assigned to each SDB phenotype.
   Results: Trajectory analysis identified four phenotypes: no SDB (65.7%), early-onset SDB (15.7%) with peak symptoms at nine months, late-onset SDB (14.2%) with peak symptoms at 18 months, and persistent SDB (5.3%) with symptoms from 3 to 24 months. Rhinitis was associated with all three SDB symptom trajectories (p < 0.05). Children with gastroesophageal reflux disease presented with early (p = 0.03) and late SDB (p < 0.001). Maternal obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) was associated with persistent (p = 0.01) and late SDB (p < 0.001). Atopy (positive skin prick test at one year) was associated with persistent SDB (p = 0.04). Infants born prior to 36.5 weeks gestational age were more likely to present with late SDB (p = 0.03).
   Conclusion: Childhood SDB symptoms, rather than being a homogenous disorder, may comprise multiple overlapping phenotypes each with unique risk factors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: A higher density of sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) spindles has been cross-sectionally associated with more efficient cortical-subcortical connectivity, superior intellectual and learning abilities, and healthier emotional and behavioral traits. In the present study, we explored to what extent sleep spindle density (SSD) at age five years could predict emotional and behavioral traits at six and nine years.
   Methods: A total of 19 healthy preschoolers at age five years underwent in-home sleep EEG recordings for visual scoring of non-rapid eye movement stage 2 (NREM-S2) sleep spindles, and SSD in NREM-S2 was calculated. Parents and teachers rated children's emotional and behavioral characteristics at ages five, six, and nine years.
   Results: Higher SSD at five years predicted higher prosocial behavior scores at nine years, as rated by parents and teachers, and lower hyperactivity scores as rated by teachers. Multiple regression analyses showed that SSD predicted prosocial behavior and hyperactivity independently of earlier prosocial behavior or hyperactivity.
   Conclusion: The pattern of results suggests that a higher SSD at five years is predictive of higher scores for positive emotional and behavioral characteristics four years later. Therefore, spindle density indices might be acknowledged as an indicator not only of cognitive but also of emotional-behavioral development in children. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Sleep wake cycle and eating patterns undergo major changes throughout life and have been proved to be very correlated. Eating disorder prevalence is increasing and sleep problems are very common among them. The current study is concerned with investigating the sleep pattern in anorexia and bulimia female patients using both subjective and objective assessment tools.
   Methods: A cross sectional study of sleep patterns using structured sleep disorder questionnaire and full night polysomnography in 23 female patients with bulimia and anorexia, patients aged 18-45 years not on any treatment for a month at least, compared to a sex and age matched control group (20 participants), all cases were collected from the Institute of Psychiatry, Ain Shams University over 18 months interval.
   Results: Significant affection of most domains of sleep measured by subjective and objective assessment tools in patients compared with the control group.
   Discussion: Sleep is equally affected in bulimia and anorexia patients, confirming that sleep and eating disorders are highly correlated. Sleep may be a clinical marker in eating disorders. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Levels of steroid hormones such as androgens and cortisol exhibit circadian variation, and their fluctuations are related to the sleep-wake cycle. Currently, the functional role of different stages of sleep in steroid hormone secretion remains unclear. The present study aims to explore the effect of slow-wave sleep (SWS) suppression on morning levels of cortisol and androgens.
   Methods: Twelve healthy male volunteers participated in two experimental sessions: a session with selective SWS suppression during night sleep and a session with regular night sleep (control). SWS suppression was achieved by stimulation using an acoustic tone. Salivary samples were collected in the morning immediately after awakening and again 40 min later. The samples were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for testosterone, androstenedione (Ad), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), and cortisol.
   Results: SWS suppression reduced overall SWS duration by 54.2% without significant changes in total sleep time and sleep efficiency. In the session with selective SWS suppression, the average level of morning testosterone was lower than in the control session (p = 0.017). Likewise, 17-OHP was lower in the SWS suppression condition (p = 0.011) whereas the ratio of DHEA/Ad was higher (p = 0.025). There were no significant differences between sessions in cortisol, Ad, or DHEA concentrations.
   Conclusions: The effect of selective SWS suppression on morning levels of testosterone and 17-OHP points to the importance of SWS for the synthesis and secretion of androgens. These results suggest that chronic sleep problems, which lead to reduced SWS, increase the risk for the development of androgen deficiency in the long term. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

ID HEADACHES; DISTURBANCE; CHILDHOOD
AB Introduction: For several years, pineal cysts have been considered an incidental finding on brain MRI's even though research and case reports have shown a possible association of pineal cysts with headaches and sleep disturbances. This pilot study aims to evaluate sleep disorders in school-age children with an incidental pineal cyst in an otherwise normal brain MRI.
   Method: Children aged 6-12 years, who were referred for evaluation of headaches, tics, or syncope, and had an incidental pineal cyst on an otherwise normal brain MRI were included and compared to a control group of children with the same referral reasons but with a normal MRI and to a cohort of normal controls. The Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children (SDSC) was administered to the parents. Exclusion criteria included use of medications that affect sleep, seizures, brain abnormalities, tumors, or comorbid medical conditions that affect sleep.
   Results: Eighteen children (11 females) with pineal cysts, 19 children with normal MRI, and 100 age- and sex-matched controls were included in our study. There were statistically significant differences in the total SDSC score (with a difference of 10 between the median scores) and in two of the six domains of this scale. Children with pineal cysts scored significantly higher in the domains of disorders of excessive sleepiness and disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep than the two control groups. The scores in these two domains correlated significantly with the size of the cyst.
   Conclusion: School-age children with pineal cysts have significantly increased levels of sleepiness and difficulty with sleep initiation and maintenance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Both short sleep duration and sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are associated with poor neurocognitive development. However, the co-contributions of short sleep duration and SDB on neurodevelopment in pre-school children are relatively unknown.
   Methods: We assessed both sleep duration and SDB by quarterly questionnaire from three months to two years of age among Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort participants. Group-based modeling determined trajectories of total, daytime, and nighttime sleep duration and SDB. Linear regression was used to assess the impact of sleep duration and SDB trajectories on cognitive (primary outcome) and language (secondary) development at two years of age as assessed by the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID-III) (mean 100; standard deviation of 15).
   Results: Of the 822 CHILD Edmonton participants, 703 (86%) were still enrolled at two years of age with 593 having BSID-III data at two years of age. Trajectory analysis identified four total sleep durations phenotypes [short sleepers (17.9%), decline to short sleepers (21.1%), intermediate sleepers (36.9%) and long sleepers (24.1%)]. Compared to children with intermediate sleep durations, short sleepers had a 5.2point lower cognitive development score at two years of age [standard error (SE) 1.7; p = 0.002]. Nocturnal sleep duration, compared to daytime sleep duration had the greatest effect on cognitive development. We also identified three SDB symptom trajectories [early-onset SDB (15.7%), late-onset SDB (14.2%), and persistent SDB (5.3%)] and 79.5% of children had no SDB symptoms. Children with persistent SDB also had a 5.3-point lower language score (SE 2.7; p = 0.05) compared to children with no SDB. SDB trajectories were not associated with cognitive development.
   Conclusion: In a population-representative birth cohort study, both short sleep duration and SDB were associated with adverse neurodevelopment at two years of age. Children with short nighttime sleep duration had lowered cognitive and language scores and children with persistent SDB also had lower language scores. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Although dopamine replacement therapy is the main risk factor for the occurrence of Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease (PD), non-pharmacological risk factors for have also been identified in that population and sleep disorders could be part of them. Our objective is to determine whether Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS), that has been associated with more impulsive choices in general population regardless of dopaminergic therapy, could be associated with a specific psycho-behavioral profile and ICDs in PD.
   Methods: Eighty consecutive PD patients were screened for the presence of RLS in a cross-sectional study. Sleep features were evaluated during one video-polysomnography. The frequency of ICDs, according to standard criteria, together with a broad range of psycho-behavioral features using the Ardouin Scale of Behavior in PD, were compared in patients with RLS (PD-RLS, n = 30) versus without RLS (PD-nRLS, n = 50).
   Results: PD patients with RLS reported significantly more ICDs than those without RLS (50% versus 26%, p = 0.03), especially compulsive eating disorders, and a different psycho-behavioral profile with more hyperdopaminergic behaviors. There was no between group difference for total and dopamine agonists levodopa equivalent doses. However, age and durations of both disease and dopaminergic treatment were greater in the RLS group. Multivariate and propensity score analyses controlling for age, gender, total sleep time, disease severity, dose and duration of treatment, anxiety and depression showed that RLS was an independent predictor of ICDs in PD (OR = 5.91 [1.63; 22.1] and OR = 2.89 [1.63; 6.67] respectively).
   Conclusion: RLS per se could be a risk factor for impulsive behaviors in PD. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective/Background: To determine the prevalence of positional obstructive sleep apnea (POSA) and exclusive POSA (ePOSA) in the general population and to assess the factors independently associated with POSA and ePOSA according to gender and menopausal status.
   Patients/Methods: Participants of the population-based HypnoLaus Sleep Cohort underwent full polysomnography at home. POSA was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) >= 5/h, and supine/nonsupine AHI ratio (sAHI/nsAHI) >= 2 (ePOSA when non-supine AHI was normalized).
   Results: In this study, 1719 subjects (40-85y.o. 46% men) with at least 30 min spent in both the supine and non-supine positions were included. OSA was present in 1224 subjects (71%) (AHI >5/H). POSA was present in 53% of all subjects, and in 75% of OSA subjects. ePOSA was present in 26% of all subjects and in 36% of OSA subjects. In multivariate analyses, lower AHI and lower BMI were both associated with POSA and ePOSA in males. In premenopausal females, no single factor was associated with POSA while a lower AHI and an Epworth sleepiness scale >10 were associated with ePOSA. In postmenopausal women, a lower BMI was associated with POSA and a lower AHI and a lower Mallampati score with ePOSA.
   Conclusions: In this large population-based study, we found that POSA is present in 53% of the middle-toolder age general population, and in 75% of OSA subjects. ePOSA was present in 36% of OSA subjects, suggesting that a large proportion of them could be treated with positional therapy. AHI and BMI were differently associated with POSA in men, and pre or post-menopausal women. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: The aims of this study were to investigate whether serum levels of neurofilaments heavy chain (NfH) and light chain (NfL), neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100 calcium binding protein B (S100B): (1) change, (2) alleviate in post-therapy and (3) are associated with sleep quality and cognitive dysfunction, in patients with chronic insomnia disorder (CID).
   Methods: Forty CID outpatients constituted free-therapy group (ft-CID), in which twenty-four patients completed follow-up after six-month treatment to form re-visiting group (rv-CID), and twenty healthy good sleepers constituted control group (HC). All subjects completed questionnaires, polysomnography, Chinese-Beijing Version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-C) and Nine Box Maze Test (NBMT) to assess sleep and neuropsychological function. The serum levels of NfH, NfL, NSE and S100B were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Results: The ft-CID had higher levels of NfH, NfL, NSE and S100B than the HC. Of note, the levels of NfH, NfL and NSE were significantly reduced in the rv-CID compared to the ft-CID, but not the level of S100B. Principal components analysis revealed that in these serum biomarkers, NfL and S100B had a substantial correlation with subjective and objective sleep parameters.
   Conclusions: The CID patients had elevated serum levels of NfH, NfL, NSE and S100B, indicating existence of damaged brain microstructure, including neurons, astrocytes and neuronal terminals, which were associated with the insomniac severity or/and cognitive dysfunction and could significantly reduce after effective therapy apart from the S100B.

   ASSOCIATION; IMPACT
AB Background: Electrocardiography R-wave to radial artery pulse delay (RRD) represents pulse transit time inclusive of pre-ejection period (PEP) and arterial pulse propagation time. RRD is proposed to largely reflect arterial stiffness when PEP is accounted for (shorter RRD = higher arterial stiffness). Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) causes intermittent hypoxemia and sympathetic activation, which negatively influences vascular function. We aimed to examine the association of measures of SDB with RRD.
   Methods: Our sample consisted of participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis without prevalent cardiovascular disease who underwent a daytime arterial elasticity exam, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and overnight polysomnography. SDB measures of interest included apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) (N = 1173). RRD was regressed on each measure of SDB separately, with adjustment for other cardiovascular risk factors as well as for correlates of the PEP, another component of RRD, by including cardiac MRI measures of contractility and preload.
   Results: In multivariate analysis, among measures of SDB, ODI, a marker of intermittent hypoxemia, was inversely associated with RRD (beta = -60.2 msec per SD [15.5/hr], p = 0.04). No significant association was found with AHI. In gender stratified analyses, ODI and AHI were predictive of RRD in men only (beta = -111.3 msec per SD [15.5/hr], p = 0.01 and beta = -100.3 msec per SD [16.1/hr], p = 0.02 respectively).
   Conclusion: Severity of SDB as measured by ODI was associated with RRD, a marker of arterial stiffness. Thus, association of RRD with measures of SDB appears to be gender-dependent. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Parents are often the first to report children's sleep difficulties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of parent reports by examining the correspondence of maternal and paternal reports of children's sleep with in-home electroencephalography (EEG) sleep assessment and sleep diary reports.
   Methods: A total of 143 children (57 formerly very preterm born children) aged 7-12 years underwent one night of in-home sleep-EEG; mothers and fathers reported children's sleep-related behavior by using the German version of the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, and children and parents together completed a sleep diary of children's sleep.
   Results: Less EEG-derived total sleep time (TST) was associated with increased mother questionnaire reports of sleep duration problems, while less sleep efficiency (SE) and longer sleep onset latency (SOL) were associated with increased mother questionnaire reports of sleep onset delay. For fathers, only longer SOL was related to increased father questionnaire reports of sleep onset delay. The above-mentioned associations did not change with children's increasing age and did not differ for boys and girls. More parent questionnaire reports of sleep duration problems, sleep onset delay, and night wakings were related to shorter diary reports of sleep duration, increased sleep latency, and more nocturnal awakenings, respectively.
   Conclusions: Mother questionnaire reports of children's sleep corresponded moderately with objective measures of TST, SE, and SOL assessed with in-home sleep-EEG. Both mother and father questionnaire reports of children's sleep duration problems, sleep onset delay, and night wakings were related to diary reports of children's sleep. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Potential control strategies for an impinging receiver based dish-Brayton system have been presented for protecting the key components from the risks of overheating when the solar irradiation exceeds its design value. Two of them are selected for a detailed study: changing the effective diameter of the shading device and changing the inlet temperature. A rope-pulley shading device is developed for controlling the shading area in the center of the dish, and the change of the inlet temperature is achieved by applying a bypass at the cold side of the recuperator for reducing the heat transfer rate. Both control strategies can manage the peak temperature on the absorber surface within 1030 degrees C with an outlet temperature fluctuation between -4.1 and 15.1 degrees C, so that the impinging receiver can work for long time at any solar direct normal irradiance value. Furthermore, the temperature differences on the absorber surface are between 137.1 degrees C and 163.8 degrees C. The cases that are achieved by changing the shield effective diameter are significantly lower (11-26 degrees C) than the corresponding cases that are achieved by changing the inlet temperature.

AB The extent to which the accumulation of dust inside the collector has the capacity to influence its performance is generally overlooked. The purpose of this study therefore is to provide an understanding of the impact of dust specifically on the absorptivity and emissivity of absorber plate. Characteristics of dust deposition on its surface and associated reductions in absorptivity have been experimentally investigated in Tianjin of China. An empirical correlation is thus proposed and verified to predict the variation of absorptivity with respect to dust accumulation. Then the dusty heat transfer model has been used to estimate the collector performance drop in comparison with a similar clean one operating under the same conditions. It is concluded that the outlet temperature is largely influenced. The maximum value of efficiency drop over test periods is found to be 19.23%. Additionally, the effect of changes in absorber emissivity due to dust on the collector performance has also been studied, which is found to be so small that it can be ignored. The results of this work would improve the predictive capability of current collector simulation model.

AB Turbine is one of the key components in organic Rankine cycle, and its aerodynamic performance and geometric dimension affect the performance of the system directly. This paper presents the one-dimensional design and three-dimensional CFD analysis for an ORC radial-inflow turbine based on the parameter optimization of the system under low grade heat source conditions. Real Gas Property (RGP) file is encoded by using the NIST REFPROP database to guarantee the prediction accuracy of the working fluid properties. The results comparison between the one-dimensional design and the three-dimensional CFD simulation is carried out. What's more, the addition of splitter blade to the rotor passage is considered to optimize the ORC radial-inflow turbine. It is concluded that the three-dimension CFD results are in good agreement with the one-dimensional analysis. And the addition of splitter blade is benefit to improve the performance of the ORC radial-inflow turbine.

AB The thermo-economic optimization of a solar organic Rankine cycle (SORC) should consider the features of fluctuations in solar radiation based on local historical solar radiation. However, the use of historical solar radiation is inconvenient for thermo-economic optimization because it involves considerable computational effort for simulation. To overcome this inconvenience, we propose the thereto-economic optimization of SORC by using typical solar radiation year (TSRY). TSRY is a synthesis of typical solar radiation on the basis of historical solar radiation, indicating that TSRY can reflect the typical features of fluctuations in solar radiation in a specific area. Afterward, the multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA) is selected to optimize the dynamic performance of a small-scale SORC by using the TSRY. In GA, the evaporation temperature and capacity of thermal energy storage are taken as optimization parameters, and the power output and fluctuation in power output are optimization goals. Accordingly, Pareto frontiers that optimize the SORC performance can be obtained. The effect of different parameter combinations in the Pareto frontiers and the scale of the SORC on thermo-economic are further analyzed using annual net profit as an indicator. Our analysis shows that a minimum SORC scale for profitability is set for a given location, and the profit growth rate increases as the system scale increases.

AB This paper entails a comparative study on the performance of counter-flow dew point evaporative coolers with two different configurations (type A and type B). Type A refers to the flow configuration where the supply air flows parallel to the water film, while type B refers to the flow configuration where the supply air flows counter to the water film. Both cooler types, when compared with a conventional indirect evaporative cooler, have better potential of lowering the product air temperature below its wet bulb temperature approaching the dew point temperature. A two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model based on the continuity, momentum, energy and diffusion equations is firstly formulated and then employed to simulate the heat and mass transfer processes. The model, when validated with experimental date, shows a maximum discrepancy of 6.0%. A similarity analysis is then performed to structure the original governing equations of the model into dimensionless forms so as to evolve a fundamental platform that allows key dimensionless parameters to be determined. By regulating these key dimensionless parameters, distributions of the dew point and wet bulb effectiveness and the dimensionless product temperature are plotted via numerical simulation method. Additionally, key simulated data are regressed to obtain the empirical correlation of the dimensionless product air temperature. The key findings that emerged from the present study include: (1) the key dimensionless parameters that are essential to evaluate the performance of the counter-flow dew point evaporative cooler are supply air Reynolds number, water Reynolds number, working air to supply air mass flow rate ratio, water inlet dimensionless temperature, channel length to half width of dry channel ratio and half width of wet channel to half width of dry channel ratio; (2) comparatively, type B configuration has a higher cooling effectiveness and lower product temperature than type A configuration; and (3) the developed dimensionless product air temperature correlation for type B adhered closely to simulated results.

AB The temperature of a multi-junction (MJ) cell under high concentration is basic to evaluate the performances of a concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) system from electric and thermal point of view. The MJ cell temperature (T-c) in a CPV system depends on different parameters as concentration factor (C), cell material and environmental conditions; hence, its evaluation is a complex non-linear problem. In this paper, a Random-Forest (RF) model for the temperature analysis of two different triple junction (TJ) solar cells mounted on an experimental CPV system, is studied. The two cells are respectively constituted by InGaP/GaAs/Ge and InGaP/InGaAs/Ge, and present areas equal respectively to 5.5 x 5.5 mm(2) and 1.0 x 1.0 cm(2). The temperature of two cells has been evaluated in different working conditions as function of C, environment temperature and solar radiation. The higher temperatures have been obtained with the larger cell (InGaP/InGaAs/Ge). Moreover, an Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model and a Linear Regression Model (LRM) have been also studied to compare the RF model results. The RF model is resulted the best in comparison with the ANN and LR models both in terms of absolute error and fit capability, T-c has been evaluated for both cells by means of the RF model for C values equal respectively to 1 x , 7.33 x , 40 x and 310 x as function of environment temperature and global radiation in different hours included between 9:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. A percentage difference between the temperature values of two cells of more than 25% in favor of the larger cell has been noted. Hence, the RF model studied in this paper allows to predict the T-c values necessary to evaluate the thermal energy production of a concentrating photovoltaic and thermal system.

AB A designed model based on TRNSYS software is used to size a hybrid electrical renewable energy system that can be used to supply electrical load demands. The goal is to maintain a constant storage temperature of bitumen by compensating the thermal losses of bitumen tank through an immersed electrical heater. The developed model simulates the annual performance of different configurations of PV-Wind based Hybrid System (PWHS). It also provides the optimum configuration, which in turn, ensures supplying the needed energy with the lowest investment cost. On the other hand, a comparison study of two size deterministic methods, the yearly average month (YAM) and the worst month (WM) methods, is presented. The analysis of the designed TRNSYS model pinpoints the hybrid system requirements and the integration cost, and so far, assesses the economic and environmental impacts. Finally, the yearly average month method has served to size a grid-tied hybrid system with a lower integration cost compared to the worst month method. It's important to note that the latter method also has served to size adequately in the isolated area.

AB In this paper, a bi-stable piezoelectric energy harvester based on the bi-stable hybrid composite laminate with a new stacking sequence design is proposed. The new stacking sequence enables this bi-stable energy harvester to have some unique features, such as uniform strains of piezoelectric elements and symmetric stable configurations. Meanwhile, the new stacking sequence design enhances the room to adjust its natural frequency such that this proposed harvester allows for adjusting to lower frequency range and increasing the inertia by a tip mass to lower the demand of excitation level in comparison to previous settings. A finite element analysis is developed to investigate the static and dynamic characteristics of this new bi-stable energy harvester. A simple numerical model with a modified version of the Duffing equation is developed based on the unique nonlinear restoring force obtained from finite element analysis to describe the fundamental response characteristics of this nonlinear bi-stable energy harvester. Numerical simulations and experiments are carried out at different harmonic excitation levels ranging from 10 to 40 Hz. The results verify that the proposed model can reasonably capture the dynamic characteristics of this broadband bi-stable energy harvester. The output powers were measured under different vibration patterns. Maximum power of 31.1 mW was generated under large-amplitude and high-energy orbits cross-well vibration pattern at an excitation frequency of 22 Hz and acceleration of 3g (g = 9.8 m/s(2)).

AB The performance of a photovoltaic (PV) module depends on real operating conditions such as solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and wind speed, in addition to solar module technologies. To characterize a PV module under these conditions, the measure of the entire current-voltage (I-V) curve in short time requires a suitable data acquisition device. This paper outlines the features of a low-cost acquisition device to characterize a PV module under real operating conditions. It is based on a set of MOSFET IRF540N, and load resistances, an Arduino board, and sensors of current and voltage with high resolution and sampling rate. This system permits to sweep the entire I-V curve by taking a current-voltage point (I, V) within one msec. The effects of operating temperature and solar irradiance on the module performance are investigated. The physical parameters of the module have been extracted by two methods using three solar cell models. The temperature correction coefficients for current, voltage, and efficiency are calculated. The results show a good agreement with those found in the literature.

AB In this work, torrefaction of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin were studied at a series of torrefaction temperatures (210, 240, 270, and 300 degrees C) based on the properties of their three-phase products, namely solid, liquid (water and tar), and gaseous products. Among the three biomass components, significant difference of torrefaction characteristics was found due to their different molecular structures. For the solid product, hemicellulose presented lowest yield from 85.65% to 41.54% as the temperature increased because of the poor thermostability, thereby showing obvious variations in carbon and oxygen contents. For the gaseous product, CO2, followed by CO, were the dominant gaseous components in all torrefaction conditions including different feedstock and temperatures; also a small number of other components (H-2 and CH4) were produced during torrefaction of lignin. The liquid product was composed of water and a small amount of tar. For the tar product, acids and ketones were the dominant components in the torrefaction of hemicellulose, while anhydrosugar in the tonefaction of cellulose, and phenols in the torrefaction of lignin. As the temperature increased from 210 degrees C to 300 degrees C, about 19.76-71.11%, 5.85-33.27%, and 16.28-44.89% of oxygen from hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin, respectively, was transformed into the liquid and gaseous products. Dehydration reaction and volatilization of the oxygenated gaseous product were the two dominant deoxygenation pathways, and the water, CO2, and CO were the dominant carriers of oxygen migration. In contrast to oxygen, only a small amount of carbon was transferred into tar product, followed by gaseous product, consequently the solid samples still retained most of the energy.

AB All Solar Thermal Power (STP) systems are exposed to the variability of solar insolation. Due to the heliocentric nature of the system, seasonal and continuous time variations, investigation of operating point selection is a continuing concern for STP systems. This paper explores the relationship between cycle design, operating conditions and off-design performance; exploring the response that several turbines have to a wide range of operating conditions.
   By systematically developing radial turbines for each cycle design and evaluating each turbine over a range of operating conditions, the study found that for previously indistinguishable radial inflow turbine designs - both cycle design and operational factors have a significant influence on performance. Furthermore, the performance is made more sensitive under certain cycle designs. Specifically, there exists an optimal combination of specific power, temperature and pressure that will optimise both on- and off-design performance. For example, when using the new approach developed in this paper, it was found that the maximum specific power that may be generated by the radial inflow turbines developed for CO2 was 142.27 kJ/kg. Previous methods focussed on the off-design performance of turbomachinery alone, the present work extends the application to incorporate more in-depth analysis of the interaction between design parameters and off-design performance of cycles and turbomachinery. The new map-based method developed in this study can be easily integrated into existing power block design codes and may be used in the early cycle design phase to ensure that performance is consistently high by considering the actual operating conditions.

AB In the current study, a comprehensive thermodynamic analysis (energy and energy analyses) of a beta-type Stirling engine has been performed at different working conditions. First, a non-ideal adiabatic model has been proposed for performance analysis of the Stirling engine and in order to increasing its accuracy, the frictional and thermal losses of Stirling engine have been considered. Also, for model validation, the operational and geometrical specifications of a beta-type Stirling engine which made in General Motors Corporation called GPU3 have been used. The results of the present model have been compared with the experimental data of NASA Lewis Research Center and the results of other previous adiabatic models. Then, the effects of engine rotational speed, mean engine operating pressure, and regenerator length on energy efficiencies and energy destruction have been investigated for two working gases of helium and hydrogen. The results show that with increasing the engine rotational speed, the frictional and thermal losses increase, and the energy efficiency reaches to its maximum value at shorter lengths of regenerator. Also, with increase of the mean engine pressure, due to reduction of the effects of frictional and thermal losses, a larger regenerator can be used. Furthermore, the results show that hydrogen has higher energy efficiency at longer regenerator length due to its low viscosity and high specific heat.

AB The main objective of the study was to improve the fuel properties, performance and reduce the level of hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) when running with water in diesel emulsion fuel (W/D) by adding various nano-additives. Aluminium Oxide (Al2O3), Copper(II) Oxide (CuO), Magnesium Oxide (MgO), Manganese(IV) Oxide (MnO) and Zinc Oxide (ZnO) nano-additives were selected for W/D with 10% water (E10). Each nano-additive was added to El0 at a dosage of 50 ppm and further denoted as nano-additive emulsion fuel: E10Al(2)O(3), E10CuO, E10MgO, E10MnO and E10ZnO. The properties (density, viscosity, water droplet size, stability period and oxidative thermokinetics), performance (torque, brake power, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), and emission (nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), carbon dioxide (CO2), CO and HC) of each test fuel were investigated. Overall, nano-additives tended to increase density, viscosity, water droplet size and oxidative thermokinetics but decrease the stability period. The nano-additives resulted in a marginal increase of performance with the E10Al(2)O(3) yielding the highest reduction in BSFC. The nano-additives also lowered the brake specific CO (BSCO) emissions compared to Euro 2 standard diesel (D2) by up to 17% with ElOZnO. Nano-additives produced from different metals impact the fuel properties, performance and emissions differently. Al2O3 is nominated as the best nano-additive due to the smallest water droplet size, highest DTGx and its consistency in increasing the torque and reducing the BSFC, brake specific NOx (BSNx), BSCO compared to other nano-additives. That is to say, nano-additives coupled with a W/D has the potential to reduce BSFC and BSCO simultaneously.

ID PISTON STIRLING ENGINES; HEAT-TRANSFER; OPTIMIZATION; PERFORMANCE; POWER
AB The Franchot engine is a double acting Stirling engine with only two cylinders and freely controllable phase angle. The hot and cold cylinders of the Franchot engine can be directly heated and cooled and thus act as heaters/coolers. However, the cylinders are necessarily long and thin to increase the heat transfer area and hence the power. The long strokes result in long cranks and connecting rods which lead to large and unwieldy engines. In this contribution, the directly heated and cooled multi-cylinder Franchot engine is dynamically studied with a novel balanced compounding mechanism. Thus, the balanced compound Franchot engine would be more compact, cheaper and more efficient due to the removal of the rotational parts. The new mechanism includes a linkage between two connecting rods in a conventional Franchot engine for which, four pistons (an expansion, compression and two guiding pistons) move as one reciprocator. The influence of different engine parameters, such as number of cylinders, temperature, dead volume and reciprocator mass, on the new configuration is investigated. The possible phase angles for each number of cylinders are given. The balanced compound Franchot engine changes the order of piston motion so that the largest of these phase angles is obtained. The theoretical analysis shows that increasing the number of cylinders, dead volume and reciprocating mass reduces the frequency and increases the stroke; increasing the cylinder diameter increases the frequency and decreases the stroke; increasing the load decreases the stroke and slightly decreases the frequency; and increasing the temperature increases both the frequency and the stroke. Thus, different engine parameters can be used to maximise the power generation without the piston hitting the cylinder head. The dynamic load, which is a function of the speed, does not prevent the balanced compound Franchot engine from self-starting while static friction can prevent the engine from self-starting, especially if the pistons are around the mid-stroke point. The most promising configuration is the three-phase engine which has the lowest number of cylinders, preferable phase angle and phase shift of 120 degrees and potential for electricity generation and heat pumping.

AB The present study compares diesel engine performance, emissions, energy and exergy parameters of three nonedible biodiesels blends and a reference diesel. The three biodiesel blends were prepared so as to keep the blend oxygen percentage at around 3.3 wt%. Considering the economy and availability, waste cooking and macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia) biodiesels were chosen for all the engine experiments. A commercial diesel was used as a reference fuel to compare the performance and emissions with those of the biodiesel blends. To keep the oxygen percentage of the blends approximately the same as for the reference diesel, around 30% waste cooking biodiesel was added to 70% reference diesel to make the first blend. Similarly, around 30% macadamia biodiesel was mixed with 70% reference diesel to make the second blend. In addition, 10% macadamia biodiesel and 20% waste cooking biodiesel were mixed with the 70% reference diesel to make the third blend with similar oxygen content. The macadamia blend is designated as MaD, the waste cooking blend is termed WcD, and the blend with macadamia and waste cooking biodiesel is abbreviated as MaWcD. This study aimed to investigate the influence of the fuel-oxygen on engine performance, emissions, energy and exergy parameters. A well-instrumented, 4-cylinder, 4-stroke, naturally aspirated direct injection (DI) diesel engine was used for the experiments. The engine was loaded and coupled with an eddy current dynamometer. Performance, emissions, energy and exergy parameters for the three biodiesel blends were compared with those of the reference diesel. Without significant reduction in engine performance, a significant reduction in total unburnt hydrocarbon (THC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM) emissions with a penalty of increased nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions were realised with all three biodiesel blends.

AB This study offers an efficient method to improve manufacturing technique of metallic bipolar plates (BPPs) so as to simultaneously reduce contact resistance (CR) and maximize power density in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). CR plays an important role in the energy conversion in the cell and can be normally reduced by coating on the BPP surface. Nevertheless, the effect of fabrication process on the CR has not been revealed, especially for the welding and forming characteristics. In this paper, a comprehensive three-dimensional finite element model of BPP/gas diffusion layer (GDL) assembly was established to investigate the influences of coating, weld and dimensional error on the CR, which are produced during the fabrication process of metallic BPPs. Experiments were carried out to validate the accuracy of the model. The results indicate that direction and distribution of the current in the cell change significantly with altering the weld path of metallic BPPs, which are different from graphite BPPs. 47% CR reduction is observed for the case of dense weld arrangement. For the coating process, it is found that the necessity of coating on both sides of single BPP is quite low if channel number is less than 20. Statistic simulation was conducted to investigate the effect of dimensional error on CR. Specially, 14.5% increment in CR is found when the dimensional error exceeds 30 pm. The methodology developed is beneficial to the fabrication management of metallic BPPs and the efficiency improvement of PEMFC.

AB Accurate simulation of photovoltaic characteristics is now a mandatory obligation before validating an experiment; hence, accurate model and parameters of solar cells are indispensable. This paper presents an improved explicit double-diode model based on the Lambert W function (EDDM-LW), and then compares the fitness and parameter extraction performance. By defining two new parameters (K and r) to separate the exponential function in double-diode model (DDM) and using the Lambert W function, the explicit expression for I-V characteristics is proposed. In contrast to exiting works, the new parameters can readily be computed by the electrical characteristics of the standard test condition without an implicit characteristic. To verify the accuracy of the proposed model, the fitness difference is first investigated with a solar cell and three different types of solar modules. The results indicate that under the same parameter values, EDDM-LW achieves the lowest root mean square error value and exhibits better fitness in representing the I-V characteristics. In addition, the optimal parameters are extracted by an improved teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm. The experimental results show that the optimal parameter values extracted from EDDM-LW are more accurate than those extracted from DDM. Based on these observations, EDDM-LW can be deemed a useful and practical model for the simulation, evaluation, and optimization of the photovoltaic system.

AB The mixed Burr-Generalized Extreme Value distribution (BGEV) and Gaussian copulas were used in a two-step procedure for estimating the directional wind energy yield in 100 m above ground level in Germany. Ina first step, BGEV was fitted to the marginal distributions of ERA-5 reanalysis horizontal wind vector component data available from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Then, Gaussian copulas were fitted to the bivariate distributions of the wind vector components. It is demonstrated that the combination of BGEV and Gaussian copulas allows a very accurate simulation of the directional wind energy yield. Results from goodnessof-fit evaluation indicate very good fit to virtually all wind speed-wind direction regimes reproduced by the ERA5 data in the period 2010-2016. The directional mean annual wind energy yield was simulated for eight wind direction sectors by applying a 3.05 MW wind turbine power curve. The simulation results illustrate that Germany's available wind energy is highly dependent on the wind direction. Mainly southwestern and western flows contribute to the total mean annual wind energy yield. All other wind direction sectors contribute only to a minor extend to the amount of extractable wind energy. The areas where mean annual wind energy yield is highest are mostly located in Northern Germany at the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts.

AB This paper evaluates the use of a phase change composite (PCC) material consisting of paraffin wax (n-Tetradecane) and expanded graphite as a potential storage medium for cold thermal energy storage (TES) systems to support air conditioning applications. The PCC-TES system is proposed to be integrated with the vapor compression refrigeration cycle of an air conditioning (AC) system. The use of this PCC material is novel because of its unique material and thermal characteristics as compared to ice or chilled water that are predominantly used in commercial TES systems for air cooling applications. The work of this paper proposed and tested a hypothesis, which suggests that integrating a conventional AC with a PCC-TES would result in significant benefits concerning compressor size, compressor efficiency, electricity consumed and CO2 emissions. The proposed integration would also contribute to reduce electricity demand during peak hours and reduce necessity to build more expensive power plants and distribution lines. To test the hypothesis, a simulation model in Aspen Plus (R) software was prepared. However, Aspen Plus (R) does not have a built-in library to predict PCC's melting and solidification behaviors. Therefore, an analytical heat transfer model was written as a system of equations in Fortran code into Aspen Plus (R) calculation block to simulate the phase change behavior and associated characteristics. The overall simulation model, which was designed specifically for this research work, consists of two main parts that communicate with each other. The first part simulates the AC's refrigeration loop using the built-in Aspen Plus (R) components and the second part implements the PCC heat transfer model written within the calculation block of Aspen Plus (R). The simulation model was validated by crosschecking the calculated results with actual experimental data from an actual 4 kWh PCC-TES benchtop thermal storage system. Very good agreement was observed between the simulations and laboratory data. Simulated performance of the proposed integration between the AC and the PCC-TES indicated the potential to (1) downsize the compressor by 50%, (2) lower electrical consumption by the compressor by 30%, (3) lower CO2 emissions by 30%, and (4) double the compressor efficiency during off and mid peak hours. The present work is a conceptual design and optimization study and does not account for integration inefficiencies, energy losses, real-world operation complexity, and added capital cost of TES integration with AC systems.

AB In this work, a modified Particle Method in fluid mechanics involving irregular distribution and discontinuity issues is proposed. Due to the approximation accuracy, momentum conservation and governing equation feasibility, traditional Particle Method, Moving Particle Semi-implicit (MPS) method in this paper, cannot guarantee the accuracy and stability of computation, and the divergence calculation in Navier-Stokes equation may cause numerical error in computation domain with discontinuity. To enhance the computation accuracy of Particle Method, we modify the gradient operator with a corrected tensor emanating from minimizing the local error of the first-order Taylor Expansion approximation. Besides, inspired by Peridynamic which is mostly used in solid mechanics, a new governing equation in an integral form which maintains the momentum conservation is obtained. Combining the modified gradient and new governing equation, we obtain a new particle-based method. The numerical results verify its feasibility and illustrate a good computational performance of proposed Method in the fluid dynamics involving non-uniform particle distribution.

AB The use of PDE-constrained optimization techniques in combination with transient three-dimensional turbulent flow simulations such as Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) or Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) involves large computational cost and memory resources. To date, the minimization of a DNS-based cost functional is typically achieved by applying classical single-grid gradient-based iterative methods of quasi-Newton or non-linear conjugate gradient type. In the current study, a multigrid optimization (MG/OPT) strategy is investigated in order to speed up gradient-based algorithms designed for large scale optimization problems. The method employs a hierarchy of optimization problems defined on different representation levels. It aims to reduce the computational resources associated with the cost functional improvement on the finest level. We apply the MG/OPT method in the context of direct numerical simulations of a fully developed channel flow problem. The performance of the multi-grid optimization technique is compared against the single-grid optimization method in terms of equivalent function and gradient evaluations. Also the influence of the optimization problem properties and algorithmic parameters are investigated. It is found that, in some cases, the MG/OPT method accelerates the single-grid damped L-BFGS method by a factor of four. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We present a set of effective outflow/open boundary conditions and an associated algorithm for simulating the dynamics of multiphase flows consisting of N (N >= 2) immiscible incompressible fluids in domains involving outflows or open boundaries. These boundary conditions are devised based on the properties of energy stability and reduction consistency. The energy stability property ensures that the contributions of these boundary conditions to the energy balance will not cause the total energy of the N-phase system to increase over time. Therefore, these open/outflow boundary conditions are very effective in overcoming the backflow instability in multiphase systems. The reduction consistency property ensures that if some fluid components are absent from the N-phase system then these N-phase boundary conditions will reduce to those corresponding boundary conditions for the equivalent smaller system. Our numerical algorithm for the proposed boundary conditions together with the N-phase governing equations involves only the solution of a set of de-coupled individual Helmholtz-type equations within each time step, and the resultant linear algebraic systems after discretization involve only constant and time-independent coefficient matrices which can be pre-computed. Therefore, the algorithm is computationally very efficient and attractive. We present extensive numerical experiments for flow problems involving multiple fluid components and inflow/outflow boundaries to test the proposed method. In particular, we compare in detail the simulation results of a three-phase capillary wave problem with Prosperetti's exact physical solution and demonstrate that the method developed herein produces physically accurate results.

AB This work is motivated by an extension of both the Burgers-Fisher and the Burgers-Huxley equations in multiple dimensions, considering Riesz fractional diffusion. Initial-boundary conditions which are positive and bounded are imposed on a closed and bounded set, and a finite-difference method is proposed to approximate the solutions of the fractional model. The methodology is a linear and implicit technique which is based on fractional centered differences. We show in this manuscript that the method can be expressed in vector form using a Minkowski matrix under suitable conditions. The main properties of Minkowski matrices are used then to establish the existence and the uniqueness of the solutions of the finite-difference method, as well as the capability of the technique to preserve the positivity and the boundedness. Additionally we show that the method is a consistent technique which is stable and convergent, with first order of convergence in time and second order in space. Some illustrative simulations show that the scheme is capable of preserving the positivity and the boundedness of the numerical approximations. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The interaction of electromagnetic waves with metallic nanostructures generates resonant oscillations of the conduction-band electrons at the metal surface. These resonances can lead to large enhancements of the incident field and to the confinement of light to small regions, typically several orders of magnitude smaller than the incident wavelength. The accurate prediction of these resonances entails several challenges. Small geometric variations in the plasmonic structure may lead to large variations in the electromagnetic field responses. Furthermore, the material parameters that characterize the optical behavior of metals at the nanoscale need to be determined experimentally and are consequently subject to measurement errors. It then becomes essential that any predictive tool for the simulation and design of plasmonic structures accounts for fabrication tolerances and measurement uncertainties.
   In this paper, we develop a reduced order modeling framework that is capable of realtime accurate electromagnetic responses of plasmonic nanogap structures for a wide range of geometry and material parameters. The main ingredients of the proposed method are: (i) the hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method to numerically solve the equations governing electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric and metallic media, (ii) a reference domain formulation of the time-harmonic Maxwell's equations to account for arbitrary geometry variations; and (iii) proper orthogonal decomposition and empirical interpolation techniques to construct an efficient reduced model. To demonstrate effectiveness of the models developed, we analyze geometry sensitivities and explore optimal designs of a 3D periodic coaxial nanogap structure. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper presents an approximate direct method for solving a class of fractional optimal control problems by combining the epsilon and Ritz methods and utilizing multiscaling basis functions. By applying the epsilon method, we transform the given optimal control problem into a variational problem. Then, we solve the variational problem approximately by the Ritz direct method with multiscaling polynomial basis functions. The choice of multiscaling basis functions provides a high rate of convergence for the Ritz method. The convergence of the derived approximate minimal to the exact one is extensively discussed. At the end some illustrative test examples are included to demonstrate the efficiency of the technique. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB For constructing high order accurate positivity-preserving schemes for convection-diffusion equations, we construct a simple positivity-preserving diffusion flux. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) schemes with such a positivity-preserving diffusion flux are nonlinear schemes, which can be regarded as a reduction of the high order positivity-preserving DG schemes for compressible Navier-Stokes equations in [1] to scalar diffusion operators. In this paper we focus on the local DG method to discuss how to apply such a flux. A limiter on the auxiliary variable for approximating the gradient of the solution must be used so that the diffusion flux is positivity-preserving in the sense that DG schemes with this flux satisfies a weak positivity property. Together with a positivity-preserving limiter, high order DG schemes with strong stability preserving time discretizations can be rendered positivity-preserving without losing conservation or high order accuracy for convection-diffusion problems with periodic boundary conditions or a special class of Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. Numerical tests on a few parabolic equations and an application to modeling electrical discharges are shown to demonstrate the performance of this scheme. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Based on kinetic model equation, a unified gas-kinetic scheme for axisymmetric flow (UGKS-AS) is proposed in the whole flow regimes. The flux transport of UGKS-AS is based on a reduced gas distribution function of a time integral solution of the full 3D BGK model. In the cylindrical coordinate system, the local time evolution of convection and source terms for the macroscopic and microscopic flow variables is fully coupled with particle free transport and collisions. As a result, a multiple scale UGKS-AS is developed and used for the flow simulation from the free molecular transport to the Navier-Stokes solutions. In comparison with the full 3D UGKS method for axisymmetric flow, the present scheme is much more efficient and gives accurate solution in all flow regimes. Different from operator splitting methods with decoupled treatment of particle transport and collision, for the Navier-Stokes solution in the continuum regime the UGKS-AS doesn't have the constraint on the time step being less than the particle collision time. To further improve the efficiency of the scheme for steady state solution, an implicit UGKS-AS method is also developed. A large number of numerical tests for axisymmetric flow are conducted by the proposed explicit and implicit UGKS-AS, which include inner and outer, steady and unsteady, low and high speed flows. Some tests are very challenging due to the delicate capturing of very small flow variations. The good agreement among the solutions from the present scheme and other analytical, numerical, and experimental studies, validates the high accuracy and efficiency of the UGKS-AS for non-equilibrium flow simulation in all regimes.

AB We present three new semi-Lagrangian methods based on radial basis function (RBF) interpolation for numerically simulating transport on a sphere. The methods are mesh-free and are formulated entirely in Cartesian coordinates, thus avoiding any irregular clustering of nodes at artificial boundaries on the sphere and naturally bypassing any apparent artificial singularities associated with surface-based coordinate systems. For problems involving tracer transport in a given velocity field, the semi-Lagrangian framework allows these new methods to avoid the use of any stabilization terms (such as hyperviscosity) during timeintegration, thus reducing the number of parameters that have to be tuned. The three new methods are based on interpolation using 1) global RBFs, 2) local RBF stencils, and 3) RBF partition of unity. For the latter two of these methods, we find that it is crucial to include some low degree spherical harmonics in the interpolants. Standard test cases consisting of solid body rotation and deformational flow are used to compare and contrast the methods in terms of their accuracy, efficiency, conservation properties, and dissipation/dispersion errors. For global RBFs, spectral spatial convergence is observed for smooth solutions on quasi-uniform nodes, while high-order accuracy is observed for the local RBF stencil and partition of unity approaches.

AB Based on the existing cell-node and cell-centered compact finite difference schemes, we developed a new central compact scheme with a high spectral resolution for the acoustic wave equation. In the new scheme, both the function values on the cell-nodes and cell-centers are used to compute the second-order spatial derivatives on the cell-nodes. The cell-centered values are stored and updated as independent variables in the modeling. The spatial derivatives on the cell-centers are evaluated by half shifting the indices in the formula designed for the cell-nodes. Compared to the conventional compact interpolation scheme, the proposed approach can avoid introducing transfer errors. Either Taylor-series expansion-based or optimized least-squares-based methods are used to calculate the finite difference coefficients. Theoretical analysis and synthetic examples demonstrate that the optimized least-squares-based method can provide higher accuracy than the Taylor-series expansion-based method. This new scheme is not a simple combination of the cell-node and cell-centered compact schemes and outperforms them in three scenarios. Firstly, it can promise higher accuracy considering the same formal truncation errors and model parameters. Thus, it can maintain superior precision while using a shorter spatial finite difference stencil. Secondly, compared to the cell-node compact scheme with half of grid spacing, the new scheme can yield equally as accurate results with less time consuming, together with saving approximately 25% and 29% of memory in 2D and 3D modeling, respectively. Finally, for similar memory requirements, the new method can more efficiently provide solutions with higher accuracy. The synthetic examples on the 2D homogeneous and the 3D horizontally-layered models demonstrate the advantages of the proposed scheme. The numerical simulations with 2D Marmousi model further validate its accuracy, efficiency and flexibility in complex media. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The resistive Magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) model describes the behavior of a strongly ionized plasma in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields. For problems involving the plasma with an open boundary to very low pressure/vacuum regions, the continuum assumption is no longer valid in the entire domain of interest. For example, this is seen in a plasma accelerator where a dense plasma expands into a vacuum background. A common practice to deal with this issue is to assign small values of density and pressure to the vacuum regions and proceed to solve the continuum based MHD equations throughout the domain. We show that this approach fails to produce solutions consistent with the physics of the problem and can give rise to unacceptable artifacts such as spurious shocks. We develop a plasma-vacuum interface tracking approach to mitigate this problem. The plasma-vacuum interface is tracked in a physically consistent manner and the MHD equations are solved only in the regions that contain the plasma. The interface tracking is achieved using a face-flux formulation derived from the theoretical solution to a 1D free expansion problem. Coupled with a threshold based approach, the interface tracking is implemented for both explicit and implicit time stepping frameworks on generalized unstructured grids. Simulations of magnetized thermal plasma jets expanding into a vacuum background indicate plume profiles devoid of the unphysical shock obtained using the small background density approach. In the context of resistive MHD simulations, the interface tracking approach overcomes the numerical stiffness induced by specifying a large background resistivity in the vacuum regions, resulting in significant wall-clock time gains.

AB A diffuse interface immersed boundary method is proposed for problems with arbitrarily moving complex rigid bodies. The solid-fluid interface is replaced by fluid-fluid Lagrangian boundary. A universal equation that combines the momentum conservation and rigid body velocity through the volume fraction is solved in the entire domain. The ever changing volume fraction field is accurately computed locating the object boundary. As the desired boundary conditions are only enforced directly in a volume average sense scope of it spreads over a computing cell. Thus, by reducing size of the computing cell the proposed method approaches the conventional sharp interface methods though it eliminates the spurious force oscillations. Owing to the single universal equation on a fixed Eulerian Cartesian mesh the proposed method retains the simplicity, robustness and versatility of the original Cartesian grid simulation. Convergence study of the transverse oscillation of a cylinder shows second-order convergence with refinement of numerical parameters and significantly diminished force oscillation. The proposed method is parallelized on a mixed shared and distributed memory notions in order to facilitate large scale 2D and 3D simulations. A range of test cases have been carefully chosen to check the quality of prediction of the proposed technique for forced and induced motions of multiple objects. They include in-line, transverse and rotational forced motion of a circular cylinder, motion of a hovering thin wing, vortex induced vibration (VIB) of multiple circular and square cylinder, angular VIB of multiple objects, particle sedimentation, instability driven fluttering of a freely falling plate, settling of a sphere in a quiescent medium, 3D VIB of two cylinders, wake transition due to pitching of a large aspect ratio thin plate and turbulent wake behind a wavy cylinder.

Assuming that Omega and B are two bounded sub-domains of R-d, with (B) over bar subset of Omega, in order to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a Navier slip condition on the boundary gamma of the obstacle B, we advocate a fictitious domain method where one solves a simpler variant of the original problem on the whole Omega, followed by a well-chosen correction over B. This method is of the virtual control type and relies on a least-squares formulation making the problem solvable by a conjugate gradient algorithm operating in a well chosen control space. A detailed discussion of the finite element implementation of the above methodology is also provided. Numerical results are given; they suggest optimal order of convergence. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB This work aims at developing a high-order numerical method for the propagation of acoustic shock waves using the discontinuous Galerkin method. High order methods tend to amplify the formation of spurious oscillations (Gibbs phenomenon) around the discontinuities/shocks, associated to the relative importance of higher-harmonics resulting from nonlinear propagation (in our case). To handle this critical issue, a new shock sensor is introduced for the sub-cell shock capturing. Thereafter, an element-centered smooth artificial viscosity is introduced into the system wherever an acoustic shock wave is sensed. Validation tests in 1D and 2D configurations show that the method is well-suited for the propagation of acoustic shock waves along with other physical effects like geometrical spreading and diffraction.

AB We show how to simulate the dynamics of many body quantum systems using Graphics Processing Units or a similar heterogeneous architecture. In particular, we focus on the one dimensional quantum Ising model. Its entire time evolution is computed in parallel. The dynamics of this model provides a valuable information regarding defects created during quantum annealing. Counting such imperfections comprise a perfect test for assessing correctness of adiabatic quantum computing (B. Gardas et al. (2017) [11]).

AB We present a backward semi-Lagrangian method with third-order temporal accuracy for solving the guiding center problem. For solving highly nonlinear characteristic curves, we propose an iteration-free L(alpha)-stable method equipped with an error correction technique and a classical collocation method. As a discretization of the Poisson equation, we adopt the fourth-order centered differential scheme and the Shortley-Weller discretization depending on the boundary of the domain, and apply the local cubic interpolation polynomial for the evaluation of the density and the potential at the non-grid foot points of the characteristics. The novelty of the proposed method is its good stability as well as its outstanding computational cost compared to those of the recently developed high-order Adams-Moulton method. Furthermore, based on several numerical tests, we conclude that the proposed method exhibits excellent performance for long-time stable simulations and allows for large temporal step sizes.

AB A generalized fluid-particle hybrid model for collisionless plasmas under the assumption of quasi-neutrality is presented. The system consists of fluid ions and electrons as well as arbitrary numbers of species whose dynamics is governed by the Vlasov equation. The proposed model is thus a generalized version of the well-known standard hybrid plasma simulation model, in which the ions are fully kinetic whereas the electrons are assumed to be a fluid. Since the proposed model employs the exact form of the generalized Ohm's law, the mass and energy densities, as well as the charge-to-mass ratio of the kinetic species, are taken to be arbitrary. In the absence of the kinetic species, it reduces to the quasi-neutral two-fluid model [1] In the opposite situation where the mass and energy densities of the kinetic species are much larger than the fluid ions, it is nothing more than the standard hybrid model with finite electron inertia effect. If the kinetic species is an energetic particle (EP) population having negligible mass density but substantial energy density and the scale size is much larger than the ion and electron inertial lengths, it describes the self-consistent coupling between the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and the EP dynamics. The energetic-particle-magnetohydrodynamics (EP-MHD) hybrid model is thus a special case of the more general model described in this paper. Advantages of this approach over the existing models are discussed. A three-dimensional simulation code solving the proposed set of equations is described. The code combines the Particlein-Cell scheme for solving the kinetic species and a Riemann-solver-based code for the two-fluid equations. Several benchmark simulation results are shown to confirm that the code successfully captures the dynamics of the EP population interacting self-consistently with the MHD fluid.

AB In this paper we propose a new high order accurate space-time discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element scheme for the solution of the linear elastic wave equations in first order velocity-stress formulation in two and three-space dimensions on staggered unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes. The method reaches arbitrary high order of accuracy in both space and time via the use of space-time basis and test functions. Within the staggered mesh formulation, we define the discrete velocity field in the control volumes of a primary mesh, while the discrete stress tensor is defined on a face-based staggered dual mesh. The space-time DG formulation leads to an implicit scheme that requires the solution of a linear system for the unknown degrees of freedom at the new time level. The number of unknowns is reduced at the aid of the Schur complement, so that in the end only a linear system for the degrees of freedom of the velocity field needs to be solved, rather than a system that involves both stress and velocity. Thanks to the use of a spatially staggered mesh, the stencil of the final velocity system involves only the element and its direct neighbors and the linear system can be efficiently solved via matrix-free iterative methods. Despite the necessity to solve a linear system, the numerical scheme is still computationally efficient. The chosen discretization and the linear nature of the governing PDE system lead to an unconditionally stable scheme, which allows large time steps even for low quality meshes that contain so-called sliver elements. The fully discrete staggered space-time DG method is proven to be energy stable for any order of accuracy, for any mesh and for any time step size. For the particular case of a simple Crank-Nicolson time discretization and homogeneous material, the final velocity system can be proven to be symmetric and positive definite and in this case the scheme is also exactly energy preserving. The new scheme is applied to several test problems in two and three space dimensions, providing also a comparison with high order explicit ADER-DG schemes. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB We are interested in the development of surrogate models for uncertainty quantification and propagation in problems governed by stochastic PDEs using a deep convolutional encoder-decoder network in a similar fashion to approaches considered in deep learning for image-to-image regression tasks. Since normal neural networks are data-intensive and cannot provide predictive uncertainty, we propose a Bayesian approach to convolutional neural nets. A recently introduced variational gradient descent algorithm based on Stein's method is scaled to deep convolutional networks to perform approximate Bayesian inference on millions of uncertain network parameters. This approach achieves state of the art performance in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification in comparison to other approaches in Bayesian neural networks as well as techniques that include Gaussian processes and ensemble methods even when the training data size is relatively small. To evaluate the performance of this approach, we consider standard uncertainty quantification tasks for flow in heterogeneous media using limited training data consisting of permeability realizations and the corresponding velocity and pressure fields. The performance of the surrogate model developed is very good even though there is no underlying structure shared between the input (permeability) and output (flow/pressure) fields as is often the case in the image-to-image regression models used in computer vision problems. Studies are performed with an underlying stochastic input dimensionality up to 4225 where most other uncertainty quantification methods fail. Uncertainty propagation tasks are considered and the predictive output Bayesian statistics are compared to those obtained with Monte Carlo estimates. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, we consider time step control for variational-monolithic fluid-structure interaction. The fluid-structure interaction (FSI) system is based on the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach and couples the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with geometrically nonlinear elasticity resulting in a nonlinear PDE system. Based on the monolithic setting, we develop algorithms for temporal adaptivity that are based on a rigorous derivation of dual-weighted sensitivity measures and heuristic truncation-based time step control. The Fractional-Step-theta scheme is the underlying time-stepping method. In order to apply the dual-weighted residual method to our setting, a Galerkin interpretation of the Fractional-Step-theta scheme must be employed. All developments are substantiated with several numerical tests, namely FSI-benchmarks, including appropriate extensions, and a flapping membrane example. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Apatite has recently gained considerable attention, providing new insight into a wide range of geological processes, such as geochronology, magmatism, metasomatism and metallogenesis. Here, we investigate the U-Th/He dates, in situ major- and trace- element concentrations, and Sr-87/Sr-85 ratios of apatites in the dacite from the southwestern Okinawa Trough to constrain its eruption age and the petrogenesis. The U-Th/He dating of apatites indicates that the volcanic eruption that formed the dacite was no older than 0.28 Ma and that the eruption was related to the replenishment of mafic magma. Apatites are present in the dacite as inclusions within pyroxene phenocrysts and are protected them from the external melt environment; therefore, they should retain a reliable record of their original chemical composition. In addition, all the apatite grains are fluorapatites with F contents of 1.58-2.54 wt.% and Cl contents of 0.57-0.88 wt.%. These grains are enriched in REEs (FREE = 3341-5527 ppm) with significant Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0,20-0.24), low Sr/Y radios (0.20-0.35), high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios (range from 0.70635 to 0.70697). Based on these characteristics, we propose that the dehydration of subducted slab released fluids into the overlying mantle wedge and triggered mantle melting, which produced primitive mafic magma with high Cl content. Then, the mafic magma ascended into the crust, which has low Cl concentrations and high Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. The mixing of a mantle-derived basaltic magma and a crustal felsic magma in a shallow magma chamber diluted the Cl content and elevated the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio, thus producing the parental magma of the dacite. When the magma chamber was replenished by mafic magma at approximately 0.28 Ma, the high temperature from the injection would have caused the felsic melt to move upward and finally erupt.

AB An earthquake of magnitude (M = 5.4) occurred on 19 May 2009 in the Lunayyir Volcanic Field (LVF), Saudi Arabia. The LVF is covered by recent basaltic rocks. The earthquake caused damages to the surrounding areas and resulted in surficial rapture trending in NNW-SSE direction with about 8-km length. Due to concern in future damaging earthquakes or volcanic activities, the government evacuated the residents for over 3 months.
   Seismologists from the Saudi Geological Survey (SGS) studied the recorded seismicity data around the damaged area to locate the epicenter of the (M = 5.4) earthquake. After extensive studies, they suggested that the main cause of the M = 5.4 event was magma dike intrusion at depth of about 5 km. However; the dike did not reach the surface and no eruption took place.
   Detailed ground and airborne gravity surveys around the earthquake area was carried out in an attempt to understand the reason of the earthquake and imaging the subsurface geology. In that regard, 380 gravity stations were measured in an area of about 600 km(2) covering the surficial rupture. The gravity data was analyzed using edge detection tools and a 3D inversion technique.
   The results indicate that the 8-km surficial rupture extends toward the SE direction into the sub-surface which suggested a future seismic activity along this extension. Additionally, the dike intrusion location has low density values compared with the surrounding area which imply that this dike intrusion was created in the past, cooled, and solidified. Consequently, we assign the M 5.4 earthquake and the associated seismic swarm to simultaneous Red-Sea-Rift-parallel faulting and magmatic intrusion.

AB The Beiya Au deposit in the Sanjiang metallogenic belt, SW China, is a porphyry-skarn deposit that formed in an intracontinental setting. Three stages of hydrothermal veins, namely quartz veins (Stage 1), quartz-pyrite veins (Stage 2), and Au-rich sulfide-quartz veins (Stage 3) were identified on the basis of field relationship and petrography under scanning electron microscopy cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL). Intermediate density aqueous fluid inclusions (ID1, ID2), high density brine inclusions (B1, B2), and low density vapor inclusions (V1, V2) have been identified in both Stage 1 and Stage 2 veins. Only liquid-rich fluid inclusions (L3) were found in Stage 3 veins. Raman spectroscopy revealed that all the inclusions contain abundant CO2 center dot H2S was identified in ID2 and V2 inclusions. Salinities and homogenization temperatures of the intermediate density aqueous fluid inclusions (ID1, ID2), high density brine inclusions (B1, B2), and low density vapor inclusions (V1, V2) are 7.4 +/- 1.1-11.9 +/- 2.2, 33.6 +/- 0.5-39.2 +/- 1, and 1.6 +/- 0.7-5.8 +/- 0.8 (wt% NaCl equiv.) and 400 +/- 35-440 +/- 37, 395 +/- 20-414 +/- 6, and 386 5-416 +/- 4 degrees C, respectively. Salinities and homogenization temperatures of the L3 inclusions range from 4.9 1.6 to 9.8 0.7 (wt% NaCl equiv) and from 301 28 to 398 4 degrees C, respectively. Initial intermediate density aqueous fluid inclusions contain 2000-10,000 ppm Fe, 2000-4000 ppm Cu, 200-600 ppm Zn, 200-500 ppm Pb, 17-89 ppm Mo, 1-8 ppm Ag, and 0.9-5.9 ppm Au, comparable to that of intermediate density inclusions in subduction-related porphyry deposits. Brine inclusions are rich in metals and have 9000-24600 ppm Fe, 3400-11,000 ppm Cu, 1200-5200 ppm Pb, 500-3000 ppm Zn, hundreds of ppm Mo, and tens of ppm Ag. The corresponding vapor inclusions contain lower metal concentrations: 400-6000 ppm Fe, 1700-4700 ppm Cu, 50-270 ppm Pb, 100-500 ppm Zn, and minor Mo and Ag. Low to intermediate density fluids are abundant and are inferred to have been the main metal transporting medium. A temperature decrease to approximately 350 degrees C during Stage 3 triggered metal precipitation.

   CHINA; MUD; MARINE; SUCCESSION; COLLISION; ORIGIN
AB The ongoing exploration for shale oil and gas has focused sedimentological research on the transport and deposition mechanisms of fine-grained sediments, and more specifically on fine-grained mass-flow deposits. It appears, however, that no easily applicable classification scheme for gravity-flow deposits exists, and that such classifications almost exclusively deal with sandy and coarser sediments. Since the lack of a good classification system for fine-grained gravity flow deposits hampers scientific communication and understanding, we propose a classification scheme on the basis of the mud content in combination with the presumed transport mechanism. This results in twelve types of gravity-flow deposits. In order to show the practical applicability of this classification system, we apply it to the Triassic lacustrine Yanchang Formation in the southern Ordos Basin (China), which contains numerous slumps, debris-flows deposits, turbidites and hyperpycnites. The slumps and debrites occur mostly close to a delta front, and the turbidites and hyperpycnites extend over large areas from the delta slopes into the basin plain.
   The case study shows that (1) mud cannot only be transported but also deposited under active hydrodynamic conditions; (2) fine-grained gravity-flow constitute a significant part of the lacustrine mucistones and shales; (3) muddy gravity flows are important for the transport and deposition of elastic particles, clay minerals and organic matter, and thus are important mechanisms involved in the generation of hydrocarbons, also largely determining the reservoir capability for unconventional petroleum.

AB Ankleshwar oil field situated in the southern part of the Cambay basin, forms one of the prominent onshore Tertiary hydrocarbons bearing regions of western India. A detailed multiparametric lithological analysis of the well logs obtained from 16 deep wells, indicate conspicuous trend of inversion in density and transit time below a depth of about 1250 m, which coincides with the presence of moderately high overpressure zone within the reservoir and appear temperature induced. Estimated temperature gradient based on the corrected Bottom Hole Temperatures, recorded at different depths in the boreholes, are found to be quite high (similar to 53 degrees C/km) at deeper levels, especially in the overpressured zone, that contains low conductive Cambay shales. Estimated heat flow of 75.2 mW/m(2) at Ankleshwar, together with high Moho temperatures of about 880 degrees C and an extremely shallow depth to subcrustal melting (similar to 50 km), would suggest that not only the northern part, the entire hydrocarbon bearing Cambay basin, along with the Mumbai offshore region, is anomalously warm. In view of the presence of high thermal anomaly, low conductive shales of the Cambay basin might be a good target for shale gas investigation, as the prevailing in situ temperature is one of the crucial factors in oil-to-gas cracking.

AB The widespread large-scale Mo-Au-Pb-Zn mineralization in the southern margin of the North China Craton (NCC) is spatially and temporally associated with the voluminous late Mesozoic granitic magmatism. Relationship between the granitic magmatism and ore mineralization has been extensively investigated in the last decade. However, controversy still exists regarding the magma source, metallogeny and geodynamic settings. This paper systematically reviews the major features of the Mesozoic granitic magmatism and associated Mo-Au-Pb-Zn mineralization in the southern margin of the North China Craton, including temporal and spatial variations of magmatic rocks, composition of ore-fluids, sources of ore metals, and metallogeny. The granitic rocks were mainly formed in late Mesozoic and emplaced in two stages. The early-stage (158-128 Ma) granites are of typical I-type derived from remelting of ancient crust of the southern margin of the NCC with input of mantle material under lithospheric thinning tectonic regime. The late-stage (127-112 Ma) granites include A type and/or highly fractionated I-type granites, which commonly contain more fractions of mantle materials as exhibited by more depleted isotopic signatures, suggestive of an intracontinental extensional setting. Mo mineralization (155-130 Ma) related to the early-stage granitic magmatism includes mainly of porphyry or porphyry-skarn type with ore metals mainly derived from the mixed source of the mantle and crust, whereas the late-stage Mo mineralization (127-116 Ma) is mainly of porphyry type with the ore metals from similar sources with more input of mantle materials. Pb-Zn deposits (144-130 Ma) associated with the early-stage granitic magmatism are mainly of hydrothermal vein and skarn types, whereas those (125-117 Ma) related to the late stage granites are of hydrothermal vein type. The Pb-Zn deposits are most likely distal products of the Mo deposits, together forming a metallogenic system. Au deposits are located in the Xiaoqinling and Xiong'ershan areas, and were formed during Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous (163-118 Ma) mostly from 132 to 120 Ma. The ores mainly occur in quartz veins and altered rocks and are hydrothermal magmatic in origin with Au derived from a mixed source of crust and mantle.

AB Storm-induced deposits in the sedimentary record can now be easily identified on account of a better understanding of processes of unidirectional and oscillatory flow. Thin-bedded sandstone, siltstone, and interlayered mudstone deposits of the Oligocene Jianquanzi Member in the Yaxi Area of the Jiuxi Basin along the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau were formed by shallow lacustrine storm-generated flows. Petrologic analysis reveals that the sandstones exhibit moderate to high compositional maturity but are texturally sub mature to immature. Based on investigation of drill cores, six storm-deposit lithofacies are identified, including massive or graded sandstone, parallel and trough cross-bedded sandstones, hummocky cross-stratified sandstone, wave-rippled sandstone and siltstone, massive or horizontal bedded mudstone, and structurally deformed sandstone and mudstone. In a vertical succession, these lithofacies occur as three fining-upward lithofacies associations, each of which represents different architectural elements (and depositional processes) of proximal to distal storm deposits. The relatively coarse proximal architectural element is formed by strong density flows and unidirectional-dominated combined flows; the transitional architectural element is dominated by unidirectional- and oscillatory-dominated combined flows to pure oscillatory flows, resembling Tb-e divisions of the classic Bouma sequence; the relatively fine distal architectural element is dominated by unidirectional-dominated combined flows with a very weak oscillatory flow component. The origin of storms responsible for these deposits is attributed to Asian winter monsoons associated with the paleoclimatic and paleogeographic setting.

Throughout the 14-day incubation, degradation of E2-3G in river water, at environmentally-relevant level (25 ng/L), obeyed first-order kinetics with the formation of 17-ss estradiol and estrone; in contrast, E2-3S was slowly converted to estrone-3-sulphate stoichiometrically. Degradation of the two conjugates across the spiking concentrations (0.01-1 mu g/g) was much faster in sediment than in river water where 25 ng/L of conjugate standards were spiked, possibly due to relatively high population densities of microorganisms in sediment. De-conjugation of the thio-ester bond at C-3 position and oxidation at C-17 position were the predominant degradation mechanisms for E2-3G and E2-3S, respectively, with negligible presence of metabolites estrone-3-glucuronide for E2-3G and 17ss-estradiol for E2-3S. In addition, delta-9(11)-dehydroestrone and 6-ketoestrone were determined as new metabolites of the two conjugates. Also, a lactone compound, hydroxylated estrone and a few sulfate conjugates were tentatively identified. With the observation of new metabolites, biodegradation pathways of E2-3G and E2-3S were proposed. The formation of new metabolites may pose unknown risks to aquatic biota. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Microalgae biotechnology is a promising tool for many applications, including the elimination of nutrients and other contaminants from wastewater. In this work, we measured the removal efficiency of two wastewater treatment processes: an activated-sludge based conventional process and another based on microalgae biotechnology using high-rate algae ponds (HRAPs). The latter was tested using two different configurations. In the first one, HRAPs were placed after an UASB reactor and used as a tertiary treatment to remove nutrients. In the second, the UASB reactor was disconnected so the HRAPs were directly fed with pretreated wastewater. Additional treatment was performed using dissolved air flotation (DAF). The performances of both configurations (UASB-HRAP and HRAP-DAF) were compared to that of the conventional line including primary and secondary biological treatments and operating in parallel within the same wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Sixty-four out of 81 target PhACs were detected in the influent of the WWTP, at an average concentration of 223 mu g L-1, whereas 55 and 54 were measured in the conventional (14 mu g L-1) and non-conventional (17 mu g L-1) effluents. Average removal efficiencies were similar (94 vs. 92%) for both treatment lines when comparing total PhACs concentrations. The compositional patterns of the resulting effluents, however, were not, suggesting the occurrence of differential removal mechanisms depending on the chemicals and wastewater treatments considered. Highly consumed compounds such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen were predominant in the non conventional effluent (>1 mu g L-1), denoting lower removal than in the conventional line. On the other hand, elimination of diclofenac and some specific antibiotics and diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) was between 15 and 50% higher using HRAPs. Overall, the efficiency of the microalgae technology removing PhACs was found to be comparable to that used in conventional WWTP5. This, combined with a higher efficiency removing nutrients, shows the potential of HRAP technology for wastewater treatment as an alternative (or addition as tertiary treatment) to more conventional approaches based on activated sludge.

AB Chaoborus spp. (phantom midge) are prevalent in eutrophic inland waters. In Lake Soppen, Switzerland, C. flavicans larvae diurnally migrate between the methane-rich, oxygen-depleted hypolimnion and sediments, and the methane-poor, oxygen-rich epilimnion. Using a combination of experiments and system modelling, this study demonstrated that the larvae's burrowing activities in and out of the sediment perturbed the sediment and re-introduced sequestered phosphorus into the overlying water at a rate of 0.022 mu g P ind(-1) d(-1), thereby exacerbating internal nutrient loading in the water column. Fluxes of sediment methane and other reduced solutes enhanced by the larval bioturbation would consume oxygen and sustain the hypoxic/anoxic condition below the thermocline. In addition to increasing diffusive fluxes, migrating larvae also directly transported methane in their gas vesicles from the deep water and release it in the surface water at a rate of 0.99 nmol CH4 ind(-1) d(-1), potentially contributing to methane emission to air. As nutrient pollution and climate warming persist or worsen in the coming decades, proliferation of Chaoborus could intensify this positive feedback loop and delay lake recovery.

AB To address the management of eutrophication in aquatic systems, the behavioral mechanisms that drive change at the individual level must be considered when designing policy interventions. This analysis identifies the beliefs that are critical to behavioral change, and explores the likelihood that farmers will adopt two management practices believed to be critical to reducing nutrient loading to recommended levels in Lake Erie. We find that there is potential for farmers to adopt key infield practices needed to reduce nutrient inputs. And further, that increased adoption of such practices is possible by increasing the perceived efficacy of the majority of farmers who are motivated to take action. Integrating these findings with physical models of nutrient movement indicates that adoption of these practices in combination with edge of field practices can attain phosphorus reduction targets for the lake. Future research should focus on measuring the effectiveness of education and outreach programs aimed at engaging farmers and promoting adoption of recommended practices. Such programs may only be effective if they are successfully building farmer confidence in their ability to implement the practices (i.e., perceived self efficacy) and increasing farmer's belief in the effectiveness of the practices at reducing nutrient loss and improving local water quality (i.e., perceived response efficacy).

AB Due to the aeration system, biological reactors are the most energy-consuming facilities of convectional WWTPs. Many biological reactors work under intermittent aeration regime; the optimization of the aeration process (air diffuser layout, air flow rate per diffuser, aeration length ...) is necessary to ensure an efficient performance; satisfying the effluent requirements with the minimum energy consumption.
   This work develops a CFD modelling of an activated sludge reactor (ASR) which works under intermittent aeration regime. The model considers the fluid dynamic and biological processes within the ASR. The biological simulation, which is transient, takes into account the intermittent aeration regime. The CFD modelling is employed for the selection of the aeration system of an ASR. Two different aeration configurations are simulated. The model evaluates the aeration power consumption necessary to satisfy the effluent requirements. An improvement of 2.8% in terms of energy consumption is achieved by modifying the air diffuser layout. An analysis of the influence of the air flow rate per diffuser on the ASR performance is carried out. The results show a reduction of 14.5% in the energy consumption of the aeration system when the air flow rate per diffuser is reduced. The model provides an insight into the aeration inefficiencies produced within ASRs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB High electrical energy is required for the electro-Fenton process to remove pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater. The aim of this study was to develop a novel and more cost-effective process, specifically a microbial electro-Fenton cell (MeFC), for treating PPCPs in wastewater. Acetylene black was selected as the catalyst for H2O2 electrogeneration and Fe-Mn binary oxide for hydroxyl radical production. In addition to lowering energy needs, the MeFC produced a maximum power density of 112 +/- 11 mW/m(2) with 1 g/L acetate as a representative substrate and 10 mg/L carbamazepine (CBZ) as a typical PPCP. Comparing with electro-Fenton process, the CBZ removal in the MeFC was 38% higher within 24 h operation (90% vs. 62%). Furthermore, the CBZ removal rate in the MeFC was 10-100 times faster than that in other biological treatment processes. Such enhanced degradation of CBZ in the MeFC was attributed to the synergistic reactions between radical oxidation of CBZ and biodegradation of degradative intermediates. The MeFC provides a promising method to remove PPCPs from wastewater coupling with efficient removal of other biodegradable organics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Soil passage of (pretreated) surface water to remove pathogenic microorganisms is a highly efficient process under oxic conditions, reducing microorganism concentrations about 8 log(10) within tens of meters. However, under anoxic conditions, it has been shown that removal of microorganisms can be limited very much. Setback distances for adequate protection of natural groundwater may, therefore, be too short if anoxic conditions apply. Because removal of microorganisms under suboxic conditions is unknown, this research investigated removal of bacteriophage MS2 and PRD1 by soil passage under suboxic conditions at field scale. At the field location (dune area), one injection well and six monitoring wells were installed at different depths along three suboxic flow lines, where oxygen concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 1.7 mg/1 and nitrate concentrations ranged from 13 to 16 mg/L. PRD1 and MS2 were injected directly at the corresponding depths and their removal in each flow line was determined. The highest bacteriophage removal was observed in the top layer, with about 9 log removal of MS2, and 7 log removal of PRD1 after 16 meters of aquifer transport. Less removal was observed at 12 m below surface, probably due to a higher groundwater velocity in this coarser grained layer. MS2 was removed more effectively than PRD1 under all conditions. Due to short travel times, inactivation of the phages was limited and the reported log removal was mainly associated with attachment of phages to the aquifer matrix. This study shows that attachment of MS2 and PRD1 is similar for oxic and suboxic sandy aquifers, and, therefore, setback distances used for sandy aquifers under oxic and suboxic conditions provide a similar level of safety. Sticking efficiency and the attachment rate coefficient, as measures for virus attachment, were evaluated as a function of the physico-chemical conditions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge of leveraging biomass characteristics is essential for achieving a microbial community with a desired structure to optimize anaerobic bioreactor performance. This study investigates the successive granule transformations in a high-rate anaerobic system with intermittent gas sparging and sequential increases in organic loading rates (OLRs), by establishing the correlations between the granule microstructures and reactor operating parameters. Over the course of a 196-day lab-scale trial, the granules were visualized in various stages using scanning electron microscopy, and digital image processing was applied for further quantifying their surface properties. Correlation analyses revealed that irregularities of the granule microstructures (surface properties, specific surface area and pore volume) emerged at stage 4 when the OLR was 13.31 kg COD/m(3). day and in stage 5 in the absence of gas sparging. The loading ratio (substrate surface loading to upward velocity) was identified to be the main parameter controlling the granule transformations, and the surface structures were classified into three categories for further interpretation. Confocal laser scanning microscopy analyses showed that the granule core started to hollow out from stage 4. It is also found that a rough granule surface helped accelerate the growth of the granular diameter under gas sparging. Overall, this study not only establish quantitative correlations between the granules microstructures and reactor operating parameters, but also shed light on the use of intermittent gas sparging to control the surface properties of anaerobic granules in high rate anaerobic bioreactors.

AB Decades of studies on endocrine disruption have suggested the need to manage the release of key estrogens from municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). However, the proposed thresholds are below the detection limits of most routine chemical analysis, thereby restricting the ability of watershed managers to assess the environmental exposure appropriately. In this study, we demonstrated the utility of a mechanistic model to address the data gaps on estrogen exposure. Concentrations of the prominent estrogenic contaminants in wastewaters (estrone, estradiol, and ethinylestradiol) were simulated in the Grand River in southern Ontario (Canada) for nine years, including a period when major WWTP upgrades occurred. The predicted concentrations expressed as total estrogenicity (E2 equivalent concentrations) were contrasted to a key estrogenic response (i.e., intersex) in rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum), a wild sentinel fish species. A predicted total estrogenicity in the river of >= 10 ng/L E2 equivalents was associated with high intersex incidence and severity, whereas concentrations <0.1 ng/L E2 equivalents were associated with minimal intersex expression. Exposure to a predicted river concentration of 0.4 ng/ L E2 equivalents, the environmental quality standard (EQS) proposed by the European Union for estradiol, was associated with 34% (95% CI:30-38) intersex incidence and a very low severity score of 0.6 (95% CI:0.5-0.7). This exposure is not predicted to cause adverse effects in rainbow darter. The analyses completed in this study were only based on the predicted presence of three major estrogens (El, E2, EE2), so caution must be exercised when interpreting the results. Nevertheless, this study illustrates the use of models for exposure assessment, especially when measured data are not available. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although pesticides undergo degradation tests prior to use, determining their export, degradation and persistence under field conditions remains a challenge for water resource management. Compound specific isotope analysis (CSIA) can provide evidence of contaminant degradation extent, as it is generally independent of non-destructive dissipation (e.g., dilution, sorption, volatilization) regulating environmental concentrations. While this approach has been successfully implemented in subsurface environments, its application to pesticides in near-surface hydrological contexts at catchment scale is lacking. This study demonstrates the applicability of CSIA to track pesticide degradation and export at catchment scale and identify pesticide source areas contributing to changes in stable isotope signature in stream discharge under dynamic hydrological contexts. Based on maximum shifts in carbon stable isotope signatures (Delta delta C-13 = 4.6 +/- 0.5%o) of S-metolachlor (S-met), a widely used herbicide, we estimate maximum degradation to have reached 96 +/- 3% two months after first application. Maximum shifts in nitrogen isotope signatures were small and inverse (Delta delta N-15 = -1.3 +/- 0.6%.) indicating potential secondary isotope effects during degradation. In combination with a mass balance approach including S-met main degradation products, total catchment non-destructive dissipation was estimated to have reached 8 +/- 7% of the applied product. Our results show that CSIA can be applied to evaluate natural attenuation of pesticides at catchment scale. By providing a more detailed account of pesticide dissipation and persistence under field conditions we anticipate the contribution of pesticide CSIA to the improvement of regulatory and monitoring strategies.

AB Many coastal states of the United States restrict harvest of shellfish from select areas based on some environmental trigger. Such areas are classified as being conditionally approved. In Maryland, the trigger is an inch or more of rainfall that has fallen in the last 24 h. This study used 11 years of monitoring data to test the relationship between daily rainfall totals and densities of fecal indicators in Maryland shellfish harvest waters. Precipitation and fecal coliform (FC) water monitoring data from 2004 to 2014 were matched by date and watershed. The influence of antecedent rainfall conditions (i.e. rainfall in the preceding days or weeks) and the distance of each monitoring station to land were compared to the percent of samples exceeding the FDA criterion for managing shellfish harvest areas. Sample stations beyond 1000m from land had FC densities consistently below the FDA criterion and were excluded from further analysis. Rainfall events greater than an inch tended to result in significantly elevated FC for the following two days, followed by lower levels thereafter. The total amount of rain in the last three weeks was positively related to the proportion of samples with FC greater than the FDA criterion. Bay-wide, the percent of samples exceeding the FDA criterion rose from seven percent for rainfall less than an inch to 37% following one or more inches of rain. Watersheds were classified based on the percent of FC densities over the criterion when rainfall was an inch or more, with 41 of 81 watersheds showing FC responses indicative of potential conditionally approved areas, those shellfish growing areas where the one inch precipitation trigger may be applied. These areas largely overlapped the current conditionally approved areas defined by Maryland. The percent of open water, wetlands, and poorly drained soils explained a significant amount of the variability (R-2 = 0.72) in the difference in percent of samples exceeding the FDA criterion when rainfall was greater than an inch and when it was less than an inch. Logistic regression analysis showed that the current trigger of one inch of rain in 24 h is predictive of FC densities over the FDA criterion, though the appropriate threshold will most likely depend on how far the particular shellfish growing area is from land and antecedent rain conditions. In watersheds with relatively high percentages of open water to total watershed size, higher rainfall thresholds might be appropriate. The approach taken in this study could be applied to individual stations and sub-watersheds, potentially allowing the reclassification of some shellfish harvest areas. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Effective process monitoring and instability diagnosis are important for stable anaerobic digestion (AD) of vegetable waste (VW). In order to evaluate the performance of thermophilic digestion of VW, to make early diagnosis for instability after organic overload, and to reveal the dynamics of microbial community under different running states, thermophilic AD of VW was carried out under improved organic loading rates (OLR) of 0.5-2.5 g volatile solid (VS)/(L . d) in this study. Gaseous parameters including volumetric methane production rate (VMPR), CH4, CO2, and H-2 concentrations, and liquid parameters including pH, oxidation reduction potential, volatile fatty acid (VFA), and total alkalinity (TA), bicarbonate alkalinity (BA), intermediate alkalinity (IA), and ammonia, were monitored. The coupling parameters, such as the CH4/CO2, VFA/BA, and BA/TA ratios were also used to evaluate stability. The dynamics of syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria (SAOB), acetoclastic methanogens (AM), and hydrogenotrophic methanogens (HM) were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. The main methanogenic bacteria were HM (Methanothermobacter) during the start-up period of OLR 0.5 gVS/(L . d), while they were AM (Methanosarcina) during the stable period of OLR of 1.0 gVS/(L . d). The VMPR of stable period was about 0.29 L/(L . d) with total VFA concentration below 100 mg/L, CH4/CO2 > 1.3, and BA/TA>0.9. The first instability due to the accumulation of VFA and self-recovery due to syntrophic acetate oxidation occurred at an OLR of 1.5 g VS/(L . d). The syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria probably belong to genus S1 (family Thermotogaceae). The digestion failed at an OLR of 2.0 g VS/(L . d). H-2 was only detected during collapsed period instead of instable period. The total ammonia nitrogen loss and bicarbonate alkalinity (BA) reduction were the primary causes for the instability of AD of VW without effluent recirculation. Compared with single parameters, the CH4/CO2 and BA/total alkalinity (TA) ratios are recommended as early warning indicators for engineering applications of thermophilic AD of VW.

AB The integration of adsorbents with ultrafiltration (UF) membranes is a promising method for alleviating membrane fouling and reducing land use. However, adsorbents typically are only injected into the membrane tank once, resulting in a single dynamic protection layer and low removal efficiency over long-term operation. In addition, the granular adsorbents used can cause membrane surface damage. To overcome these disadvantages, we injected inexpensive and loose aluminum (Al)-based flocs directly into a membrane tank with bottom aeration in the presence of humic acid (HA) or raw water taken from the Miyun Reservoir (Beijing, China). Results showed that the flocs were well suspended in the membrane tank, and multiple dynamic floc protection layers were formed (sandwich-like) on the membrane surface with multiple batch injections. Higher frequency floc injections resulted in better floc utilization efficiency and less severe membrane fouling. With continuous injection, acid solutions demonstrated better performance in removing HA molecules, especially those with small molecular weight, and in alleviating membrane fouling compared with the use of high aeration rate or polyacrylamide injection. This was attributed to the small particle size, large specific surface area, and high zeta potential of the flocs. Additionally, excellent UF membrane performance was exhibited by reservoir water with continuous injection and acid solution. Based on the outstanding UF membrane performance, this innovative integrated filtration with loose Al-based flocs has great application potential for water treatment. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB A series of experiments were undertaken in order to understand and predict the dosage of powdered activated carbon required to remove taste and odour compounds in an Australian drinking water treatment plant. Competitive effects with organic matter removal by aluminium sulphate during coagulation were also quantified. Data on raw and finished water quality following jar tests, as well as chemical dosages and treatment performance, were statistically analysed, and a data-driven prediction model was developed. The developed powdered activated carbon dosage prediction model can be used by the plant operators for rapid dosage assessment and can increase the preparedness of the plant to sudden taste and odour events. It was also found that total organic carbon levels and properties greatly affect the ability of powdered activated carbon to remove taste and odour compounds; on the other hand, total organic carbon removal is not affected by high taste and odour levels, since these were still much lower than organic carbon concentrations.

AB The feasibility of ammonia pre-separation during the thermal-alkaline pretreatment (TAP) of waste activated sludge was evaluated to mitigate ammonia inhibition during high solid anaerobic digestion (HSAD). The results showed that the TAP increased the organics hydrolysis rate as much as 77% compared to the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment (THP). The production and separation of the ammonia during the TAP exhibited a linear relationship with the hydrolysis of organics and the Emerson model. The pre-separation ratio of the free ammonia nitrogen exceeded 98.00% at a lime dosage exceeding 0.021 g CaO/g TS. However, the separation ratio of the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) was hindered by its production ratio. Compared to the THP, the TAP increased the methane production rate under similar production yield. A mass flow analysis indicated that the TAP-HSAD process reduced the volume of the digester compared to the THP-HSAD process and the recirculated HSAD-TAP process recovered 45% of the nitrogen in the waste activated sludge.

AB Long-term spatial-temporal investigations of microbial dynamics in full-scale drinking water distribution systems are scarce. These investigations can reveal the process, infrastructure, and environmental factors that influence the microbial community, offering opportunities to re-think microbial management in drinking water systems. Often, these insights are missed or are unreliable in short-term studies, which are impacted by stochastic variabilities inherent to large full-scale systems. In this two-year study, we investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of the microbial community in a large, full scale South African drinking water distribution system that uses three successive disinfection strategies (i.e. chlorination, chloramination and hypochlorination). Monthly bulk water samples were collected from the outlet of the treatment plant and from 17 points in the distribution system spanning nearly 150 km and the bacterial community composition was characterised by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Like previous studies, Alpha- and Betaproteobacteria dominated the drinking water bacterial communities, with an increase in Betaproteobacteria post-chloramination. In contrast with previous reports, the observed richness, diversity, and evenness of the bacterial communities were higher in the winter months as opposed to the summer months in this study. In addition to temperature effects, the seasonal variations were also likely to be influenced by changes in average water age in the distribution system and corresponding changes in disinfectant residual concentrations. Spatial dynamics of the bacterial communities indicated distance decay, with bacterial communities becoming increasingly dissimilar with increasing distance between sampling locations. These spatial effects dampened the temporal changes in the bulk water community and were the dominant factor when considering the entire distribution system. However, temporal variations were consistently stronger as compared to spatial changes at individual sampling locations and demonstrated seasonality. This study emphasises the need for long-term studies to comprehensively understand the temporal patterns that would otherwise be missed in short-term investigations. Furthermore, systematic long-term investigations are particularly critical towards determining the impact of changes in source water quality, environmental conditions, and process operations on the changes in microbial community composition in the drinking water distribution system.

AB Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] in drinking water is pending regulation in California and is being considered for regulation in other locations. While strong-base anion exchange (SBA-IX) can efficiently remove Cr(VI) to low-levels that may be required to comply with future MCLs, operational and maintenance (O&M) costs can be considerable if the spent brine is disposed of as hazardous waste. Through bench- and pilot-scale experiments and full-scale demonstrations, this study examined the ability of emerging and established brine treatment and reuse techniques as well as recently developed resins to decrease O&M costs.
   When profiling anion elution during regeneration with nanofiltration treated and untreated spent brine, it appeared that at least 1 and 3 reuse cycles were feasible, respectively. Stannous- and ferrous based reductants were more efficient than sulfur-based reductants when treating spent brine. Bed volumes to 8 mu g/L. chromium breakthrough with 7 resins varied by as much as a factor of 2 and correlated (R-2 = 0.84) with resin total exchange capacities. Spent brine reuse, segmented regeneration (an optimized brine reuse method), ferrous reduction, and nanofiltration of spent brine were estimated to decrease O&M costs by 30, 70, 63, and 61%, respectively. Selection of high performing resins was the most simple way to decrease O&M costs (up to 70% savings).
   The sum of nitrate and sulfate raw water equivalent concentrations was found to be the principal water quality parameter that influenced the performance of 4 resins in 7 different groundwaters because nitrate and sulfate concentrations were orders of magnitude greater than chromium concentrations. Resins with higher chromium capacities eluted more co-contaminants including arsenic, selenium, uranium, and vanadium because they likely had higher co-contaminant capacities. Co-contaminant elution was found to be complex because associations can form between regenerant and co-eluting anions. Sodium chloride was the most efficient regenerant, though other regenerants provided benefits such as enhanced uranium elution most likely by complexing with uranium to inhibit its precipitation. Nitrate peaking was found to be limited even when reusing untreated and nanofiltration treated spent brine. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recently, surface modified functional glasses have been the focus of attention for researchers. Among the other surface modification methods, ion-exchange process has become prominent in terms of cost effectiveness of the process, ease of production, not causing damage to the glass matrix. The aim of this work is to investigate how certain ion exchange and further heat treatment processes affect the mechanical, optical and surface properties of soda-lime silicate glass. The glass samples have been subjected to ion exchange at 320 degrees C in a molten mixture of AgNO3 and NaNO3 with molar ratios of 2:98, 5:95, respectively and heat treatment under reducing atmosphere (Ar/H-2 with a 5% H-2 volume fraction mixture). The study is conducted in two parts. The first part involves a batch of characterization on the untreated and the treated glass samples. The characterizations include optical transmittance, absorbance and reflectance measurements by UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer, FTIR analyses to examine surface properties. Scratch resistance with an increasing load and flexural strength measurements were conducted on the glass samples to determine the mechanical features of the glasses. The second part of the study includes the determination of possible corrosion mechanisms and optical properties changes of the glass surfaces after environmental test. Before and after the environmental test, optical transmission and colour analysis of the specimens were realized by UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer, FTIR analyses were conducted on the surface of the silver ion-exchanged glass samples in order to observe corrosion reaction by using the reflection technique in the 400-4000 cm(-1) wavenumber range.

AB SnO2 is a widely accepted room temperature ferromagnetic material and has found applications in rapidly growing fields of spintronics and magneto electronics. Faraday rotation diamagnetic glass has attracted research attentions in photonics, sensing and magneto optical devices due to their high refractive index, wide transmittance in UV and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) range and temperature independent Faraday rotation. In this paper, we report for the first time the fabrication of SnO2 modified diamagnetic glass with composition of xSnO(2)-(10-x)B2O3-30PbO-60Bi(2)O(3) (x = 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mol%) by melt -quenching method. The influence of SnO2 on glass forming ability, thermal, mechanical properties and Faraday rotation were evaluated through Xray Diffraction (XRD), FT-IR, Raman, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), Vicker's hardness and Verdet constant measurements. Good vitrification was achieved with SnO2 amount <= 6 molo/o. XRD spectra confirmed that too much SnO2 exist as distorted SnO6 polyhedra and there is obvious direct interaction between tin and Bi2O3 structural units. FT-IR, Raman and XPS spectra ascertain the existence of characteristic vibration of SnO4, SnO6, BbO(4), BiO3 and BO3 units. Glass with 4%SnO2 exhibited significant good glass thermal stability (102 degrees C), big Vicker's hardness (369 HV), high Verdet constant (0.1424 min/G.cm at 633 nm) and big cutoff wavelength (432 nm) due to the enhanced network connectivity, brought about by inclusion of high polarization and magnetization strong Sn-O linkages.

AB The magnetic properties and magnetostriction of a binary Dy50Co50 glassy alloy were studied in the present work. The DysoCoso glassy ribbon shows spin glass like characteristics with a spin freezing temperature of about 80 K. The magnetostriction of the glassy ribbon is reversible at temperatures above 60 K, where the glassy ribbon is soft magnetic; but is irreversible at temperatures well below 60 K, where the ribbon is hard magnetic. The effect of the magnetic structure on the magnetic and magneto-strictive behavior, as well as the mechanism of large magnetostriction for the glassy alloy, were examined.

AB Fe-Cr-based metallic glasses (MGs) have attracted extensive attention for industrial applications due to corrosion resistance that is superior to that of their crystalline counterparts. In this work, the effect of Si concentration on the electrochemical corrosion and passivation behavior of Fe43Cr15Mo14C10-x B5Ni3P10Six (x = 0, 2, 4, 6 at.%) MGs in a 3.5 wt% NaCI solution has been investigated by performing potentiodynamic polarization measurements, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cathodic polarization, the Mott-Schottky approach, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The addition of a small amount of Si (5.4 at.%) is found to have a beneficial effect on improving the thermal stability and corrosion resistance for this Fe-Cr-based MG system. However, higher Si amounts deteriorate the thermal stability due to precipitation of a (Fe, Cr, Mo)(23)(C,B)(6) phase. Also, all electrochemical measurements show that 4 at.% Si is high enough to improve the passivity stability of the system, whereas higher amounts of Si do not significantly improve the corrosion behavior. The improved passivation ability and corrosion resistance of the Si-doped MGs can be attributed to the formation of a dense and stable passive film rich in Si-and Cr-oxides.

AB Mixed polyanion glass and glass-ceramic cathodes can have the potential to overcome the disadvantages of achieving high theoretical capacities of promising crystalline network. Three targeted cathode compositions were chosen for the present study (NaFe0.5(VO)(0.5)PO4, NaMn0.7(VO)(0.3)PO4 and NaCo0.7(VO)(0.3)PO4) based on the superior performance over their crystalline counter parts with highest current density similar to 100 mAh/g. XRD results displayed that major crystalline phases (Na2FeP2O7 (COD ID: 4001802), Na2MnP2O7 (ICSD ID: 71229)) which are precipitated with an ordered triclinic, P1 structure. However, Na2CoP2O7 (ICSD ID: 71230) crystalline phase exhibits orthorhombic/P n a 21 structure. The highest conducting glass-ceramic cathode sample NaCo0.7(VO)(0.3)PO4 (sigma = 6.41 x 10(-7) S.cm(-1)) retains its discharge capacity retention as 84.5 mAh g (91%) even after 50 cycles. At a high rate of 10C, NaFe0.5(VO)(0.5)PO4 cathode sample is achieved to be highest discharge capacity retention 69.7% than NaCo0.7 (VO)(0.3)PO4 (53.76%) which is a significant feature of mixed polyanion family of glass-ceramic cathodes.

AB Glasses in the Li2O-Al2O2-SiO2 (LAS) system with different Al2O3/Li2O ratio and with or without addition of P2O5 have been synthesized and characterized by thermal analysis. The glass structure and the phosphorus environments in the glasses and their evolutions with annealing have been studied by P-31 Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Al-27{P-31} D-HMQC (Dipolar Hetero-nuclear Multiple-Quantum Coherences) NMR correlation technique. The crystallization behavior has been studied by X-ray diffraction, NMR and Raman spectroscopy. The results showed a different role for P2O5 depending on the Al2O3/Li2O ratio. For low alumina content, P2O5 plays a nucleating role while it acts as crystallization inhibitor for high alumina content. These different roles are related to different local environments of the phosphorus in the as-cast glasses. Our study emphasizes the importance of POAl complexes in the crystallization of aluminosilicate glasses.

AB The viscosity of titanium slag has a crucial effect on the separation efficiency from metallic iron, the foaming extent of slag, and the kinetics of smelting reactions. Properties of slag depend on its microstructures essentially. Molten FeO-TiO2 system was investigated through molecular dynamics simulations to characterize its structural and transport properties at 1973 K. With FeO content increasing from 5 to 50%, CNTi-O decreases from 6.02 to 5.87, CNO-Ti decreases from 2.95 to 1.89, and the structural strength of the FeO-TiO2 system is hence reduced. [TiO6] octahedron is only one stable structural unit and is distorted in molten FeO-TiO2 system. [TiO6] octahedrons are connected by two ways: edge-sharing Ti-Ti and corner-sharing Ti-Ti. The edge-sharing Ti-Ti has stronger combining capacity than the corner-sharing Ti-Ti. The structural strength and viscosity of FeO-TiO2 system will be reduced by the transformation from Ti-O-Ti to Fe-O-Ti, which is resulted from the addition of FeO. Furthermore, the self-diffusion coefficients of Fe2+, Ti4+, and O-2-follow the order: Fe2+ > Ti4+ > O2-. With FeO content increasing from 5 to 50%, the viscosity of molten FeO-TiO2 system decreases from 0.1272 to 0.0232 Pas. The results will contribute to understand and predict the macroscopic properties of high-temperature titanium slag.

AB The non-Newtonian behavior and its mechanism have not been clarified for the solid-bearing silicate melts, leading to difficulties and even errors in estimating silicate melt viscosity. In this study, a typical metallurgical slag was employed as a model system of solid-bearing silicate melt. The flow behavior of the slag was measured via a rotational type rheometer at various shear rates. The results demonstrate that the slags exhibit non-Newtonian behavior for solid fractions exceeding a critical value (Phi(c) i.e. 0.33-0.40 for the investigated samples), at which an abrupt viscosity increase occurs. Shear thinning (the viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate), thixotropy (a time-dependent shear thinning) and an apparent yield stress of 0.2-74.4 Pa for the investigated samples are the non-Newtonian characteristics observed in this study. The higher the solid fraction, the more pronounced the shear thinning. The shear thinning is mainly attributed to the disruption of crystal clusters. Thixotropic behavior is found to be caused by the irreversible microstructural evolution within the experimental time scale. The apparent yield stress is mainly due to the formation of a solid network and is increased with increasing the solid fraction.

AB In the present paper, hydrogenated amorphous silicon films were prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition method on the steel and single crystal silicon substrates. The microstructure, thermal stability and high temperature tribological properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon films were investigated by Raman, FTIR and high temperature tribometer, respectively. The tribotest results were obtained through a comparison of the tribological properties of hydrogenated amorphous silicon films in the temperature ranges of 200 degrees C to 700 degrees C. It is found that hydrogenated amorphous silicon films exhibit super low friction of 0.06 at the temperature of 600 degrees C and 0.05 at the temperature of 700 degrees C. Raman measurements show that high temperature super low friction of the hydrogenated amorphous silicon film-related friction pair is involved in the oxidation of amorphous silicon films and the steel substrate in ambient air under high temperature during sliding. The oxidation process of hydrogenated amorphous silicon films is also simulated by molecular dynamics method to understand the oxidation mechanism of high temperature superlow friction showing the role of oxidation and it provides the physical insights into the friction process of hydrogenated amorphous silicon films observed experimentally.

AB Under irradiation of amorphous AsxSe100-x films by band-gap light, it was observed that lateral mass transport of the film material change the direction of movement in the region where topological structural transition occurs (4 < x < 5 at.%.). It was detected that the rate of mass transport increases essentially with temperature and reaches the maximum near the glass-transition temperature, Tg. We propose a model based on the lateral photo-Dember effect that qualitatively describes the observed phenomenon.

AB Alkali-germanate glass composed of xLi(2)O-(100-x)[0.65GeO(2)center dot 0.35PbO] (x = 0 mol% to 40 mol%) were prepared using the melt-quenching method. The increase in density to a maximum at x = 10 mol% before decreasing indicates presence of the germanate anomaly. Both longitudinal and shear velocities, as well as both independent longitudinal (C-L) and shear (mu) moduli, also showed similar non-linear behaviors, with maximum values at x = 10 mol%. The increase in independent moduli at x < 10 mol% is suggested to be related to the germanate anomaly, in which formation of smaller three-membered GeO4 rings connected to [GeO6](2-) units leads to an increase in the rigidity and stiffness of the glass network. Meanwhile, the decrease in the elastic moduli for x > 20 mol% is suggested to be due to weakening of the glass network by progressive depolymerization of three-membered GeO4 rings in the germanate network through formation of non-bridging oxygen. In addition, bulk modulus, K-e, Young's modulus, and Debye temperature also showed similar behaviors as C-L and mu. Analysis using bulk compression and ring deformation models showed the ratio of theoretical K-e over experimental K-bc and average ring size were also affected by the germanate anomaly, and the closest to ideal isotropic compression was at x = 10 mol%.

AB Phosphate based glasses 48P(2)O(5)-(32-x)CaO-20Na(2)O-xCaF(2) (x = 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 mol%, hereafter, termed as FPGO, FPG1, FPG2, FPG3 and FPG4 respectively) with different fluoride content were prepared by keeping the ratio of P/Ca as 3. To study the influence of fluoride on the physico-chemical properties and bioactivity of phosphate based glasses, various experimental analysis such as density, elastic moduli, micro hardness, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, cytotoxicity, pH variations during in vitro studies by soaking in simulated body fluid as a function of fluoride content were carried out. A variation in density, micro hardness and elastic moduli is noted for the glass samples as a function of its fluoride content. X-ray diffraction pattern, Fourier Transform Infra-Red spectra, scanning electron microscope images and energy dispersed X-ray spectra confirmed the fluoroapatite forming ability on all the fluoride added glass samples. The elastic moduli, microhardness, rich formation of FAp and non-toxic nature of glass sample FPG3 showed the better bioactivity than all the other samples. The observed cell growth of human osteoblast like cell lines proved the non-toxic nature of glass sample FPG3. Thus the observed results confirms the glass sample with 3 mol% of CaF2 content is suitable for implant applications.

AB Nanoporous oxide was formed by self-organized two-step anodizing of FeAl intermetallic alloy in 0.3 M (COOH)(2) with 20 vol% of glycol, what allowed to decrease ionic mobility and consequently decrease current density and oxide growth rate. Additionally, the voltage range for anodizing was extended up to 40 V, while compared to FeAl anodizing in sulfuric acid. Furthermore, morphology of the grown oxide can be controlled by the voltage: pore diameter and interpore distance increase linearly with the voltage, but slopes of the fitted lines are smaller than in the case of intermetallics anodizing in different electrolytes.

AB The paper presents graphene-templated self-assembly of gold nanorods into long fibers with controllable optical properties. It is shown that the size of self-assembled nanostructures varies with time and is controlled by chemical reactions between amine groups of graphene and the functional groups of gold. The absorption peak of the nanostructures changes over time while the photoluminescence intensity is quenched. The self-assembled nanostructures with variable plasmon resonance effects are potentially usable for the fabrication of nanoscale devices for biomedical applications. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

CoCrFeMnNi showed good printability with high consolidation and uniform high hardness. It is shown that microstructure in the printed alloy is governed by epitaxial growth and competitive grain growth. As a consequence, a bi-directional scanning pattern without rotation in subsequent layers generates a dominant alternating sequence of two crystal orientations. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Ordered macro-mesoporous Mg-Al composite oxides (denoted as OMM-MA-x) with tunable macropore size and highly homogenous distribution of Mg have been synthesized via a confined evaporation induced self-assembly method, in which triblock copolymer F127 and polystyrene colloidal crystals are utilized as templates for ordered mesoporous and macroporous structures, respectively. The resultant OMM-MA-x materials exhibit a much more ordered 2D hexagonal mesostructure constituting wall skeleton of ordered macropores and more excellent textural properties than those of ordered macro-mesoporous alumina materials. More importantly, both ordered mesostructure and macroporous structure of OMM-MA-x can be well maintained even after thermal treatment at 900 degrees C or pressure treatment at 15 MPa.

AB In this study, different morphologies of polyaniline (PAni) nanostructures were obtained via interfacial polymerization. The influence of the time and temperature of polymerization on morphology was investigated. At room temperature the growth of nanosheets and nanoflowers with long polymerization time (1-5 days) was observed. In the syntheses carried out at 50 degrees C the same nanostructures were obtained with only a few hours of polymerization, which illustrates that the increase in temperature considerably reduced the synthesis time and also provided the growth of nanofibers, morphology not found in the syntheses performed at room temperature. The characterization by XRD indicated the presence of diffraction peaks characteristic of PAni nanostructures with high crystallinity. As the conductivity of PAni is directly related to its crystallinity, it is expected that the nanostructures obtained have high conductivity, which may represent a greater potential for diverse applications. It can be concluded that the proposed synthesis presents a simple alternative for obtaining PAni nanostructures with different morphologies and high crystallinity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A new mathematical method that considers the influences of Li-ion concentration, Li-C binding energy, and porosity simultaneously in an electrode is suggested for predicting the effective elastic modulus (EEM) of an electrode. EEMs of electrodes are significantly influenced by the porosity and ion concentration. Graphite electrodes are fabricated and tensile tests are conducted at various states of charge by constructing some pouch cells with LiMn2O4 cathode and graphite anode. EEM of graphite increases dramatically during Li-ions' intercalation into the electrode, and reaches a value up to 3 times that of the uncharged electrode. The experimental results are compared with analytical predictions to validate, and the two results show good agreement with a maximum error of 8.6%. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new approach to grow vertically aligned ZnO nanorods on glass substrates under ambient pressure was developed using microwave plasma-assisted thermal evaporation (MPATE). The results revealed that ZnO nanorods grew preferentially along their (002) plane on glass substrates without using catalysts/seed layers. Interestingly, the ZnO nanorods were completely formed within 7 min, which was much faster than other methods. The optical band gap of ZnO nanorods was 3.22 eV, indicating the photoresponse at UV region (<400 nm). Moreover, room-temperature photoluminescence of the ZnO nanorods, excited by 325 nm light, showed a dominance of green-light emission and a small UV emission. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Two dimensional (2D) hexagonal sheet-like Zinc Oxide nanostructures (ZnO NSs) have been synthesized by Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate (SDS)-assisted atmospheric microplasma electrochemical technique at room temperature. The synthesized nanostructures were investigated by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), UV-Visible spectroscopy and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The viable formation mechanism of sheet-like ZnO NSs has been proposed. XRD pattern confirmed the ZnO NSs of fine crystallinity with hexagonal phase. Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns provides accurate values for the lattice parameters. The sharp UV absorption peak at 363 nm suggested the synthesis of high-quality crystalline ZnO NSs. These NSs also showed significant antibacterial activities against various bacterial strains. In addition, ZnO NSs displayed excellent Photocatalytic activity in the degradation of Rhodamine B (Rhd B) dye in aqueous solution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Novel CdS/NiO nanocomposites assembled by satellite-like CdS nanoparticles anchoring onto porous NiO nanoplates have been fabricated by a step synthesis process, which involves a chemical bathing method followed by a heat treatment, and a microwave-assisted aqueous chemical reaction. The structure and photocatalytic properties of products were characterized by various techniques. More significantly, benefiting from the synergistic effect of CdS/NiO heterojunction, the as-prepared CdS/NiO architectures exhibited superior photocatalytic activity for decolorization of Congo red. The degradation rate on CdS/NiO nanocomposites achieves about 3.5 times higher than that of pure CdS nanocrystals under visible light irradiation for 30 min, suggesting a promising application in water purification.

Systematical characterizations showed that the ZFO NFs constructed with similar to 10 nm nano-particle subunits were uniformly covered with the ultrathin N-doped carbon shell of similar to 3 nm in thickness. When evaluated as a potential anode for Li-ion batteries, the resulted 1D core-shell ZFO@N-C NFs exhibited high-rate reversible capacities and long-term cycling stability. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB A series of BiOIO3 were prepared via in-situ crystallization method with different calcining temperatures. All samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, UV-vis, PL to explore the effect of internal electric field (IEF) among different dimensions. B-200 (calcinated under 200 degrees C) with the optimized IEF attained the most superior photocatalytic oxidation capacity in removing gas-phase Hg-0. Also, the formed 2D mixed 3D dimension changes the inter-atomic spacing to make the band bend upward, then moves the electrons and holes in the horizontally opposite direction. In combination with the above factors, the optimized IEF and dimension effectively intensify the separation of charge carriers and make the photocatalytic performance greatly improved.

AB An alternative approach of super efficiency slack-based measure data envelopment analysis has been proposed to make the projection of an efficient decision making unit strongly-Pareto efficient. The approach however did not examine the simultaneous effect of non-discretionary factors and integer requirements on efficiency measures. To obtain more accurate efficiency measures, this paper proposes a two-stage approach of super efficiency slack-based measure in non-discretionary factors and mixed integer requirements. Both new factors and requirements were first integrated into the existing approach. The optimal solution of the proposed approach was then obtained by transforming its fractional form to a linear form. Thus, the scalar measures of the proposed approach can now deal directly with discretionary mixed integer input saving-output surplus and discretionary mixed integer input excess-output shortfall. The practicability of the proposed approach was tested using empirical data of Malaysian community colleges. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a new strategy for dealing with time series exhibiting a seasonal pattern is proposed. The strategy is applied in the context of time series forecasting using kNN regression. The key idea is to forecast every different season using a different specialized kNN learner. Each learner is specialized because its training set only contains examples whose targets belong to the season that is able to forecast. This way, the forecast of a specialized kNN learner is an aggregation of target values of the same season, reducing the likelihood of misleading forecasts. Although the strategy is applied to kNN, we think that other computational intelligence approaches could take advantage of it. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The recently proposed artificial cooperative search (ACS) algorithm is a population-based iterative evolutionary algorithm (EA) for solving real-valued numerical optimization problems. It uses a rotation-invariant line recombination-based mutation strategy and rule-based crossover operator. However, it performs poorly for problems that include closely-related variables because, in these cases, generating uncorrelated feasible trial solution vectors using stochastic crossover methods is extremely difficult, and its mutation and crossover operators are also less effective. This paper adds a new QR-decomposition-based rotation-invariant search strategy to the ACS algorithm to improve its ability to solve such problems. This new, advanced ACS algorithm, called A+, has only one control parameter, alpha, and experimental results have shown that its performance does not strongly depend on the initial value of alpha. This paper also examines A+'s performance for noisy point cloud filtering, which is a complex real-world problem. The results of numerical experiments demonstrate that A+'s performance when solving numerical and real-world problems with closely-related variables is better than those of the comparison algorithms.

AB Online social networks (OSNs) are receiving great attention from the research community for different purposes, such as event detection, crisis management, and forecasting, among others. The increasing amount of research conducted with social networks opens the need for a classification methodology regarding trends in the field. This work does not cover all types of social networks; it focuses on the analysis of microblogs as a data source in the context of recommender systems (RSs). The main goal of this work is to provide authors with insights on the trends of academic literature reviews in the proposed context and to provide a comparison of different research approaches. The authors searched for up-to-date research papers related to RS methods using microblogs within a time period of five years, from 2012 to January 2018. Starting from 2012, a significant amount of research related to the subject field of RSs was conducted and identified by the authors of this work. After the filtering process, 39 papers were finally selected from journals and conferences in four different databases related to Internet technologies (i.e., IEEE, ACM, Science Direct, and Springer). A general classification presented in this work is then adopted and used to describe state-of-the-art social network recommendation approaches for microblogging. This work can be extended in the future to include novel methodologies and trends of RSs for microblogs.

AB Online media, such as blogs and social networking sites, generate massive volumes of unstructured data of great interest to analyze the opinions and sentiments of individuals and organizations. Novel approaches beyond Natural Language Processing are necessary to quantify these opinions with polarity metrics. So far, the sentiment expressed by emojis has received little attention. The use of symbols, however, has boomed in the past four years. About twenty billion are typed in Twitter nowadays, and new emojis keep appearing in each new Unicode version, making them increasingly relevant to sentiment analysis tasks. This has motivated us to propose a novel approach to predict the sentiments expressed by emojis in online textual messages, such as tweets, that does not require human effort to manually annotate data and saves valuable time for other analysis tasks. For this purpose, we automatically constructed a novel emoji sentiment lexicon using an unsupervised sentiment analysis system based on the definitions given by emoji creators in Emojipedia. Additionally, we automatically created lexicon variants by also considering the sentiment distribution of the informal texts accompanying emojis. All these lexica are evaluated and compared regarding the improvement obtained by including them in sentiment analysis of the annotated datasets provided by Kralj Novak, Smailovic, Sluban and Mozetic (2015). The results confirm the competitiveness of our approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sentiment analysis helps evaluating the performance of products or services from user generated contents. Lexicon based sentiment analysis approaches are preferred over learning based ones when training data is not adequate. Existing lexicons contain only unigrams along with their sentiment scores. It is observed that sentiment n-grams formed by combining unigrams with intensifiers or negations show improved results. Such sentiment n-gram lexicons are not publicly available. This paper presents a methodology to create such a lexicon called Send-N-Gram. Proposed rule-based approach extracts the n-grams sentiment scores from a random corpus containing product reviews and corresponding numeric rating in five-point scale. The scores from this automated procedure are compared with that of the human annotators using t-test and found to be statistically equivalent. The paper also proposes a sentiment classification methodology by using a ratio based approach based on counts of positive and negative sentences of a document. When used Send-N-Gram lexicon, proposed method outperforms well-known unigram-lexicon based approach using VADER and an n-gram sentiment analysis approach SO-CAL. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Waste collection is nowadays an increasingly important business. However, it is often an inefficient operation due to the high uncertainty associated with the real waste bins' fill-levels. To deal with such uncertainty the use of sensors to transmit real time information is seen as possible solution. But, in order to improve operations' efficiency, the sensors' usage must be combined with optimization procedures that inform on the optimal collection routes to operationalize, so as to guarantee a maximization of the waste collected while also minimizing transportation costs. The present work explores this challenge and studies three operational management approaches to define dynamic optimal routes, considering the access to real-time information on the bins' fill-levels. A real case study is solved and important results were found where significant profit improvements are observed when compared to the real operation. This shows the potential of the proposed approaches to build an expert system, which can support the operations manager's decisions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB When investing in the financial market, determining a trading signal that can fulfill the financial performance demands of an investor is a difficult task and a very popular research topic in the financial investment area. This paper presents an approach combining the principal component analysis (PCA) with the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) to generate a trading signal capable of achieving high returns and daily profits with low associated risk. The proposed approach is tested with real daily data from four financial markets of different sectors and with very different characteristics. Three different fitness functions are considered in the NEAT algorithm and the most robust results are produced by a fitness function that measures the mean daily profit obtained by the generated trading signal. The results achieved show that this approach outperforms the Buy and Hold (B&H) strategy in the markets tested (in the S&P 500 index this system achieves a rate of return of 18.89% while the B&H achieves 15.71% and in the Brent Crude futures contract this system achieves a rate of return of 37.91% while the B&H achieves -9.94%). Furthermore, it's concluded that the PCA method is vital for the good performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Feature selection plays an important role in the classification problems associated with expert and intelligent systems. The central idea behind feature selection is to identify important input features in order to reduce the dimensionality of the input space while maintaining or improving classification performance. Traditional feature selection approaches were designed to handle either categorical or numerical features, but not the mix of both that often arises in real datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm for classifying mixed-type data, based on a rough set model, called feature selection for mixed-type data with feature space decomposition (FSMSD). This can handle both categorical and numerical features by utilizing rough set theory with a heterogeneous Euclidean-overlap metric, and can be applied to mixed-type data. It also uses feature space decomposition to preserve the properties of multi-valued categorical features, thereby reducing information loss and preserving the features' physical meaning. The proposed algorithm was compared with four benchmark methods using real mixed-type datasets and biomedical datasets, and its performance was promising, indicating that it will be helpful to users of expert and intelligent systems.

AB This paper investigates the utility of EEG signals in suicidology, particularly for detection of suicidal ideation through data analysis of EEG signals elicit by reading of text notes, which may indicate genuine suicide attempt or a hoax suicide note. The role of emotion, attention, and memory in detection of suicidal ideation through perusal is studied. Also, the discriminatory role of alpha waves and beta waves is studied. Our study provides an important and interesting conclusion that prior experience or conditioned training in detection of suicide notes is not beneficial in discriminating between genuine and hoax suicide notes and that the brain signals are more discriminatory in participants with no prior experience or conditioning. Quantitatively, our results indicate that the beta waves in EEG channels related to memory can provide classification accuracy of more than 70%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Performance measurement is one of the most essential real life decision making problems faces several criteria and different types of uncertainty and vagueness. Human expertise is mandatory for such situation although it is not enough to overcome such complicated cases. Expert systems which can sense, analyze and incorporate all details of real life decision making problems are required. In this paper an expert system is proposed in form of an uncertain Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach. More formally a mixed fuzzy-robust uncertainty is addressed in the proposed DEA. Two scenario-based robust DEA models under Constant Return to Scale (CRS) and Variable Return to Scale (VRS) conditions have been proposed. Since the observed values for the inputs and outputs of Decision Making Units (DMUs) in each scenario may be ambiguous or vague, fuzzy DEA models corresponding to each of the robust scenarios are developed. So, this paper proposes four fuzzy-robust DEA models, which simultaneously maintain the advantage of each of the fuzzy and robust approaches, and at same time calculate the upper and lower bounds of the efficiency scores of DMUs under CRS and VRS conditions. Finally, to evaluate the validity and applicability of the proposed models, two numerical examples and a real case study in Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are presented and discussed.

AB This study investigates dietary fortification of heifer feeds with cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol sources and effects on beef total vitamin D activity, vitamer, respective 25-hydroxymetabolite contents, and meat quality. Thirty heifers were allocated to one of three dietary treatments [(1) basal diet + 4000 IU of vitamin D-3 (Vit D-3); (2) basal diet + 4000 IU of vitamin D-2 (Vit D-2); and (3) basal diet + 4000 IU of vitamin D-2- enriched mushrooms (Mushroom D-2)] for a 30 day pre- slaughter period. Supplementation of heifer diets with Vit D-3 yielded higher (p < 0.001) Longissimus thoracis (LT) total vitamin D activity (by 38-56%; p < 0.05) and serum 25-OH-D concentration (by 20-36%; p < 0.05), compared to that from Vit D-2 and Mushroom D-2 supplemented animals. Irrespective of vitamin D source, carcass characteristics, sensory and meat quality parameter were unaffected (p > 0.05) by the dietary treatments. In conclusion, vitamin D-3 biofortification of cattle diets is the most efficacious way to enhance total beef vitamin D activity.

AB Identification methods of collagens and gelatins have been studied many years due to religious and food safety issues. Some researchers detected the collagen while others took up their study based on DNA at the first time. In this work, we used a closed-tube loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique to differentiate collagen and gelatin samples. DNA was extracted by DNeasy mericon Food Kit and was dissolved in 30 mu l elution buffer, optimum concentration of Mg2+, deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates(dNTPs), betaine in LAMP reaction is 6.0 mmol/L, 2.0 mmol/L, and 0.8 mmol/L, respectively. After LAMP reaction, samples being detected changed their initial color to green, others' were colorless or brown slightly. The research offered a simple, fast detection technique to differentiate collagen and gelatin samples derived from porcine, bovine and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), the collagens' species can be determined by color variation in reaction tubes within two hour.

AB Nanoemulsions are useful for encapsulating nutritionally compounds of the high oleic palm oil (HOPO) including beta-carotene and tocopherols. However, some nanoemulsions can be thermodynamically unstable. For this reason, it is important to understand the thermal and thermodynamic stability of nanoemulsions and to investigate both the parameters that cause, and the mechanisms associated with, the destabilization. In this sense, the DSC, TGA and destabilization analysis were used. In this work, the average droplet size (ADS) and zeta potential (zeta) had a significant influence over HOPO nanoemulsions stability. The range of ADS and. were between 162 and 839 nm and -9to -40 mV, respectively. Furthermore, the HOPO nanoemulsions were establish until temperatures of 80 degrees C, showing lower loss of weight when the ADS was higher. Additionally, the destabilization of nanoemulsions occurred by the Ostwald ripening mechanism. The Ostwald ripening rate was provided as stability parameter which increased to nanoemulsions with ADS higher between 5 x 10(-23) and 8 x 10(-23)m(3)/s.

AB (Z)-6-Dodeceno-gamma-lactone is a potent aroma compound that has been little studied and its prevalence in wines is unknown. An efficient stable isotope dilution assay was developed using a simple, direct immersion solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method suitable for routine use with a low ng/L limit of quantitation. Using this method, 99 out of 104 young white wines analysed were found to contain detectable (Z)-6-dodeceno-gamma-lactone. The highest concentrations were found in Riesling and Viognier wines. (Z)-6-Dodeceno-gamma-lactone was found to have an aroma detection threshold of 700 ng/L in a neutral white wine. This study established that (Z)-6-dodeceno-gamma-lactone is widely present in Australia's most popular white wine varieties, but generally at concentrations below its aroma detection threshold.

AB Lupine belongs to the genus Lupinus and includes three species commonly consumed by humans. The Lupinus genus is closely related to other legumes, such as peanuts, soya, chickpeas, peas, lentils and beans. However, the consumption of lupine (and related legumes) can cause severe allergenic reactions. Therefore, reliable analytical detection methods are required for the analysis of food samples. In this study three commercially available ELISA test kits were analyzed for the detection capability of three common lupine species, as well as cross-reactivity to related legumes. All three ELISA test kits could detect the lupine species, though with different sensitivities. Cross-reactivity varied for the ELISA test kits and all showed some cross-reactivity to related legume samples analyzed.

AB Trypsin, a representative serine proteinase, was used to hydrolyse the collagen fibres from sea cucumber (Stichopus japonicus) to highlight the role of serine proteinase in the autolysis of sea cucumber. Partial disaggregation of collagen fibres into collagen fibrils upon trypsin treatment occurred. The trypsin treatment also caused a time-dependent release of water-soluble glycosaminoglycans and proteins. Therefore, the degradation of the proteoglycan bridges between collagen fibrils might account for the disaggregation of collagen fibrils. For trypsin-treated collagen fibres (72 h), the collagen fibrils still kept their structural integrity and showed characteristic D-banding pattern, and the dissolution rate of hydroxyproline was just 0.21%. Meanwhile, Fourier transform infrared analysis showed the collagen within trypsin-treated collagen fibres (72 h) still retaining their triple-helical conformation. These results suggested that serine proteinase participated in the autolysis of S. japonicus body wall by damaging the proteoglycan bridges between collagen fibrils and disintegrating the latter.

AB A simple, accurate and specific high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method has been developed and validated for simultaneous determination of sesamol, sesamin, asarinin and sesamolin in Monascus aged vinegar. The effects of acid hydrolysis and four heating treatments on the components content in Monascus aged vinegar were discussed. The results showed that the isomerisation of sesamin to asarinin, and decomposition of sesamolin to sesamol significantly increased, regardless of heating or acid hydrolysis. Thermal processes and acid hydrolysis increased the content of sesamol and asarinin, respectively, but severe thermal processes resulted in the loss of total sesame lignans. Sesamol and asarinin reached the highest (2.720 +/- 0.202 mu g/mL and 2.064 +/- 0.075 mu g/mL) for autoclaving (125 degrees C, 15 min) and acid hydrolysis (25 degrees C, 15 min, nature pH), respectively. Therefore, autoclaving and acid hydrolysis were considered as the optimal way to obtain higher content of sesamol and asarinin.

AB Liquid chromatography (LC)-Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) and LC-time-of-flight (TOF) MS operating in full scan mode at a mass resolution of 140,000 (m/z 200) and 30,000 (m/z 556), respectively, were compared for quantification of pesticide residues in tea. Both methods were validated for 146 pesticides at spike levels of 0.1 and 0.01 mg/kg and compared in terms of recovery, intra- and inter-day precisions, selectivity, linearity, and matrix effect. The results of both analyses were comparable, and recovery and intra- and inter-day precisions were within the acceptable ranges for most pesticides. LC-Orbitrap MS was slightly superior to LC-TOF MS in terms of sensitivity and selectivity due to its higher resolution. However, even using high-resolution LC-Orbitrap MS with a narrow mass window of +/- 3 ppm, interference by coeluting matrix components was observed, indicating that full scan data are insufficient for unequivocal identification, and additional information such as fragment ions is necessary.

AB Ionic liquids-based microwave-assisted hydrolysis was successfully applied for hydrolysis of puerarin and daidzein derivatives from Radix Puerariae Lobatae extract. The ionic liquids with different cations and anions have been investigated, and [Omim]HSO4 was selected as catalyst. In addition, the hydrolysis parameters, including catalyst quantity, ionic liquids concentration, microwave power and microwave time, were optimized by Response Surface Methodology. The optimal conditions were as follows: 0.82 mol/L [Omim] HSO4; catalyst quantity, 1.42 mL; microwave time, 7 min; microwave power, 400 W. Under those condition the average hydrolysis efficiency of puerarin and daidzein derivatives was 57.93 +/- 3.08%. Compared with the traditional acidic catalysts, the [Omim]HSO4 exhibited higher efficiency, which demonstrates that ionic liquids-based microwave-assisted hydrolysis was a rapid, efficient, and simple hydrolysis technique.

AB Maturity has important effects on the phytochemical and biochemical characteristics of fruits. It affects the quality, nutritional value, harvest time and commercial operations. In this study, Keitt, Sensation and Xiangya mango cultivars in four distinct stages from southwest China were evaluated for their phytochemical profiling and antioxidant activities in real time. Furthermore, the biochemical characteristics indices polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and pectin methylesterase (PME) activities were determined. Antioxidant compounds such as vitamin C, total phenolic, total flavonoid and total carotenoid content were also analysed. A total of 34 phenolic compounds were identified and quantitatively monitored by UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS. Consecutive degradation of phenolic acids and its derivatives were observed upon maturity. We found that in addition to carotenoids, phenolic acids could also be used as a measurement index of maturity in mango. Mango juices and its phenolic extracts may be used as potential prebiotics for modulating probiotic proliferation.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of enzyme treatment and post-enzyme treatment roasting on allergenicity of raw peanut kernels. Raw peanuts were treated by single-and two-enzyme treatments, respectively. Enzyme-treated raw peanuts were dry roasted. Reductions of four major allergens (Ara h 1, 2, 3, and 6) and in vitro allergenicity of peanuts were evaluated. Quantitative measurements show that enzyme treatment of raw peanuts reduced Ara h 1, 2, 3 and 6 in raw peanuts by 99-100%, 95-99%, 35-46% and 85-88%, respectively. Roasting of enzyme-treated peanuts significantly reduced the total soluble protein (P < 0.05), Ara h 3 and 6 (P < 0.0001), slightly increased Ara h 1 in the extracts (P < 0.05), but did not significantly affect Ara h 2. Immunoblot shows that the IgE-bindings of both soluble and insoluble proteins of enzyme-treated peanuts were slightly enhanced by roasting but still tremendously lower than that of untreated peanuts.

AB The current study determined the applicability of sequential and orthogonalised-partial least squares (SO-PLS) regression to relate Cabernet Sauvignon grape chemical composition to the sensory perception of the corresponding wines. Grape samples (n = 25) were harvested at a similar maturity and vinified identically in 2013. Twelve measures using various (bio)chemical methods were made on grapes. Wines were evaluated using descriptive analysis with a trained panel (n = 10) for sensory profiling. Data was analysed globally using SO-PLS for the entire sensory profiles (SO-PLS2), as well as for single sensory attributes (SO-PLS1). SO-PLS1 models were superior in validated explained variances than SO-PLS2. SO-PLS provided a structured approach in the selection of predictor chemical data sets that best contributed to the correlation of important sensory attributes. This new approach presents great potential for application in other explorative metabolomics studies of food and beverages to address factors such as quality and regional influences.

AB Although faba bean provides environmental and health benefits, vicine and convicine (v-c) limit its use as a source of vegetable protein. Crop improvement efforts to minimize v-c concentration require low-cost, rapid screening methods to distinguish between high and low v-c genotypes to accelerate development of new cultivars and to detect out-crossing events. To assist crop breeders, we developed a unique and rapid screening method that uses a 60 s instrumental analysis step to accurately distinguish between high and low v-c genotypes. The method involves flow injection analysis (FIA) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (i.e., selective reaction monitoring, SRM).Using seeds with known v-c levels as calibrants, measured v-c levels were comparable with liquid chromatography (LC)-SRM results and the method was used to screen 370 faba bean genotypes. Widespread use of FIA-SRM will accelerate breeding of low v-c faba bean, thereby alleviating concerns about anti-nutritional effects of v-c in this crop.

AB The influence of process parameters on the extraction of anthocyanins from the edible portion of fresh, sweet cherry were investigated. The optimal extraction time and temperature were determined as 90 min and 37 degrees C, respectively. A solvent/solid ratio of 10 mL/g using 100% acidified solvent resulted in the greatest anthocyanin yield. No significant difference was observed between the use of methanol or ethanol as the extraction solvent. Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-MS analysis of the extract identified four anthocyanins, with cyanidin-3-rutinoside and peonidin-3-rutinoside accounting for over 95% of the anthocyanin content, while cyanidin-3-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-rutinoside accounted for the remaining 5%. 244 mg/100 g fresh weight total anthocyanins were determined in the fresh cherries using the optimal extraction conditions.

AB Despite numerous studies, the identity of the compounds that are responsible for 'stone fruit' aroma in wine has not been conclusively established. This study focussed on wine varieties that often display peach and apricot characters, such as Chardonnay, Viognier and botrytis-affected sweet Semillon wines. Wines with high and low 'stone fruit' aroma were evaluated by gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry (GC-O-MS) using extracts representative of the aroma of the wine in a glass. No aroma-active zone was described as 'stone fruit' aroma across all three wine varietals. However, for the individual varieties, terpenes, such as linalool and geraniol, in the Viognier wines, several esters in the Chardonnay wines, and gamma-nonalactone in the botrytis Semillon were associated with 'stone fruit' aroma. Notably, this is the first study assessing the aroma profile of Viognier wine by GC-O. In addition, an extension study of Viognier grape monoterpene profiles clarified its classification as an aromatic variety.

AB The formation of ethylphosphonate (fosetyl) was investigated in wine matrices. In experimental conditions, alcoholic fermentation of grape juices spiked with phosphonic acid resulted in wines with detectable amounts of fosetyl. The ageing period adopted for these wines further increased the fosetyl content in the absence of yeast lees, thus indicating a chemical origin. A model wine assay was performed in order to study the main thermodynamic variables affecting the Fisher reaction. The results obtained allowed us to report evidence of ethylphosphonate formation in winemaking conditions, for the first time to the best of our knowledge.

AB In this study, we developed a quadruplex gold immunochromatogaraphic assay (GICA) for the simultaneous determination of four families of antibiotics including beta-lactams, tetracyclines, streptomycin and chloramphenicol in milk. For qualitative analysis, the visual cut-off values were measured to be 2-100 ng/mL, 16-32 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL and 2.4 ng/mL for beta-lactams, tetracyclines, streptomycin and chloramphenicol, respectively. For quantitative analysis, the detection ranges were 0.13-1 ng/mL for penicillin G, 0.13-8 ng/mL for tetracycline, 0.78-25 ng/mL for streptomycin, 0.019-1.2 ng/mL for chloramphenicol in milk respectively, with linear correlation coefficients higher than 0.97. The spiked experiment indicated that the mean recoveries ranged from 84.5% to 107.6% with coefficient of variations less than 16.2%, and real sample analysis revealed that the GICA can produce consistent results with instrumental analysis. These results demonstrated that this novel immunoassay is a promising approach for rapidly screening common antibiotic residues in milk.

AB alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA)-loaded microemulsion (ME) was prepared from isoamyl acetate, polyoxyethylene ether 35 (EL-35), ethanol and water. The dynamic phase behaviour was simulated using dissipative particle dynamics (DPD), which showed that spherical ME was formed at water/oil ratios of 1:9 and 9:1, while a lamellar structure with distinctive water-course and oil layer appeared at ratios of 3:7, 5:5, and 7:3. Phase stabilizing and anti-oxidation effect of environmental stresses on ALA-loaded microemulsion were investigated. Results showed that the ME region was large and had good environmental tolerance. Subsequently, the investigation of anti-oxidation stability revealed that more than 60% ALA of ALA-loaded ME could be protected from oxidation under environmental stresses. Furthermore, ALA-loaded ME was applied in aqueous-based foods. The transparency, precipitate, stratification and phase separation were used to evaluate influence of ME on product properties, confirming great feasibility and stability of ALA-loaded ME for practical applications.

AB Chlorine sanitizers used in washing fresh and fresh-cut produce can lead to generation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) that are harmful to human health. Monitoring of DBPs is necessary to protect food safety but comprehensive analytical methods have been lacking. This study has optimized three U.S. Environmental Protection Agency methods for drinking water DBPs to improve their performance for produce wash water. The method development encompasses 40 conventional and emerging DBPs. Good recoveries (60-130%) were achieved for most DBPs in deionized water and in lettuce, strawberry and cabbage wash water. The method detection limits are in the range of 0.06-0.58 mu g/L for most DBPs and 10-24 ng/L for nitrosamines in produce wash water. Preliminary results revealed the formation of many DBPs when produce is washed with chlorine. The optimized analytical methods by this study effectively reduce matrix interference and can serve as useful tools for future research on food DBPs.

AB A new vitamin E homologue, alpha-tocomonoenol was detected in palm oil, but was not isolated in large amounts and with high purity so far. Here we present an easy and fast method to isolate alpha-tocomonoenol from vitamin E rich nutrient capsules with countercurrent chromatography (CCC). With the solvent system n-hexane - benzotrifluoride - acetonitrile (10:3.5:6.5, v/v/v) about 30 mg alpha-tocomonoenol with a purity of 75% could be enriched in one step from 1 g crude sample. Column chromatography with 20% deactivated silica gel and n-hexane - ethyl acetate (95:5, v/v) was performed to gain 5.6 mg alpha-tocomonoenol with a purity of 99.5% according to GC/MS. Structural verification by H-1 NMR spectroscopy verified that the double bond was located in 11'-position (11'-alpha-tocomonoenol). The trace impurity detected in the isolate was identified to be 12'-alpha-tocomonoenol, a compound previously detected in marine samples.

AB A single-step, rapid (10 min), sensitive silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) based spectrophotometric method for antioxidant capacity (AOC) assay has been developed. The assay is based on the ability of natural polyphenols to reduce Ag(I) and stabilize the produced AgNPs(0) at room temperature. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of AgNPs at approximate to 420 nm is then measured. Using different conditions of pH (8.4) and temperature (45 degrees C) a further assay based on the production of AgNPs with selectivity for flavonols was also developed. The reactivity of the two AgNPs based assays vs. 15 polyphenols belonging to different chemical classes and 9 different samples has been studied and compared with ABTS, Folin and AuNPs based methods for AOC. The proposed assays had good reproducibility (RSD <= 13) and are simple, sensitive and cost effective. Moreover, used in conjunction with the classical AOC assays, can improve the information on the polyphenolic pool of food samples.

AB In this study, magnetic zeolitic imazolate framework-8 (Fe3O4@ZIF-8) was successfully synthesized by a typical hydrothermal method. The facile magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) based on Fe3O4@ZIF-8 was proposed for concentrating polymer additives (antioxidants and ultraviolet absorbers). The conditions of MSPE process were optimized. An analytical method of magnetic solid-phase extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography (MSPE-HPLC) was successfully established for the simultaneous determination of seven polymer additives in drinks and foods packed with plastic. The established method showed good precision, reproducibility, stability, and accuracy with the low limits of detection (0.03-0.15 ng/mL) and limits of quantification (0.08-0.50 ng/mL). The results of this study indicated the Fe3O4@ZIF-8 coupled with HPLC provided an efficient enrichment and determination method for polymer additives in drinks and foods.

AB Starch digestion in the gastrointestinal tract has different properties depending on its botanical source. In this study, corn, wheat, rice, and potato starches were used to test the digestion properties of mammalian mucosal alpha-glucosidase in an in vitro assay, and their physiological effects were investigated in male C57BL/6 mice. The results clearly demonstrated that potato starch caused the lowest rates of glucose generation, suggesting that it can attenuate the postprandial glucose spike. Interestingly, a potato starch-based diet caused significantly (P < 0.05) lower weight gain and fat accumulation compared to diets based on other starches, through increased insulin sensitivity. This result suggests that potato starch-based products can be used to regulate postprandial blood glucose levels, aiding in the control of metabolic diseases.

AB Two formulations of dark chocolate were developed by adding cocoa butter stearin (CBSt) or sorbitan monostearate (SMS) and compared to a standard formulation in order to investigate fat bloom formation over time. Fat bloom was monitored by Whiteness Index (WI), melting behavior and polymorphism determinations, in bars stored during 90 days at 20 degrees C and under oscillating temperature between 20 and 32 degrees C. All samples stored at 20 degrees C did not develop fat bloom and the required beta(V) form was maintained. Under oscillating storage condition, samples with CBSt (6.0%, w/w) and SMS (0.15%, w/w) delayed the surface fat bloom formation by at least 45 and 15 days, respectively, compared to standard chocolate, observed visually and through WI increments. The beta(V) to beta(VI) polymorphic transition correlated well with the WI, and also with changes in DSC thermograms, confirming the higher effectiveness of specific triacylglycerol (mainly StOSt) in delaying bloom formation.

AB The effect of ultrafiltration process and temperature concentration on MRPs content and antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of date palm sap syrups were investigated. MRPs were analyzed by HPLC. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by reducing power and DPPH free radical and H2O2 scavenging activities. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the agar disk diffusion method. In vitro cytotoxic activity was examined by cell proliferation assay. Date sap syrups displayed strong antioxidant activities which are correlated 5HMF and 2F contents. In addition, concentration at 100 degrees C, unlike ultrafiltration process, enhanced significantly the antioxidant activities sap syrups and total phenolic contents. The antimicrobial activities showed marked activity against S. enterica, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, L. monocytogenes with an inhibition zone of 21, 34, 27 and 34 mm respectively. Cytotoxicity assays showed that sap syrups can inhibit the proliferation of HeLa cell lines at high concentration.

AB Whey proteins (WPI) were polymerized with transglutaminase (TGase) before and after partially hydrolyzing the protein with thermolysin to produce protein nanoparticles/polymers. Electrophoresis and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to determine the size and structural characteristics of the polymers. The foaming and emulsifying properties of these nanoparticles were studied. The polymerized WPI (WPI-TG) produced more stable foams than the repolymerized WPI hydrolysate (WPIH-TG). In contrast, WPIH-TG produced better emulsions with better storage stability than WPI-TG emulsions. These differences were due to their structure and electrostatic properties: The WPI-TG particles were linear, less than 100 nm in size with lower net negative charge, whereas the WPIH-TG polymers were much larger and were highly negatively charged as judged from zeta potential. This suggested that while protein nanoparticles may provide Pickering stability to both emulsions and foams, strong lateral electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles within the adsorbed film destabilizes foams but not emulsions.

AB In order to increase the degree of substitution (DS), a combination of heat-moisture treatment (HMT) and octenyl succinylation (OSA) was used to modify sweet potato starch (SPS). The content of OSA had significant influence on the DS of starch, and DS of HMT OSA-modified SPS (HOSA-SPS) was higher than that of OSA-modified SPS (OSA-SPS), indicating that prior HMT could enhance the reaction. HOSA-SPS showed higher contents of SDS and RS in comparison with OSA-SPS as OSA concentration was beyond 6%. HMT decreased swelling power of starch while OSA modification had a contrary role (p < 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed starch was destroyed by OSA modification while HMT had slight effect on the structure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that crystal type of starch was transformed from C-to A-type resulted from HMT, and remained unchanged by OSA modification. The onset, peak, and conclusion gelatinization temperatures of starch increased by HMT and decreased by OSA modification (p < 0.05).

AB In the present study, an assessment of heavy metal content in soil and food crops (wheat, rice, maize grains and mustard seeds) and associated health risks was carried out for residents of Ropar wetland and its environs. All the soil samples had high cadmium and cobalt contents, whereas, all crop samples had high contents of cobalt and lead. Bioconcentration factor (BCF) analysis indicated that rice grains act as hyper-accumulators of chromium (BCF = 17.98) and copper (BCF = 10.91), whereas, maize grains act as hyper-accumulators of copper (BCF = 30.43). One-way ANOVA suggested that heavy metal content in food crops varied significantly at p <= 0.05 for different sites, indicating anthropogenic contribution of heavy metals in agricultural fields. Dietary intake of cobalt via all food crops posed higher non-cancer health risk to residents in comparison to other heavy metals. Chromium posed highest cancer risk through consumption of wheat grains, being staple diet in study area.

AB A selective colorimetric assay for detecting formaldehyde (FA) was proposed based on silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) templated by polymethacrylic acid (PMAA). The chemodosimeter was easily fabricated by the formation of Tollens' reagent in the presence of AgNCs (AgNCs@Tollens). The detection principle was based on the change in the color caused by the change in the particle size from nanoclusters (no LSPR) to nanoparticles (with LSPR) upon the reduction of Tollens' reagent by FA. In the presence of FA, the intensity of a new absorbance band with a maximum at a wavelength of 430 nm corresponding to the LSPR of the AgNPs linearly increased as a function of the FA concentration, exhibiting a color change that could be observed by the naked eye. This method provided a working range of 30-50 mu M with lower detection limit (LOD) of 27.99 mu M. The proposed method exhibited excellent selectivity towards FA over other aldehyde-containing compounds.

AB Purification of triglycerides from fully hydrogenated palm kernel oil (FHPKO) and fully hydrogenated coconut oil (FHCNO) was performed by a chromatographic method. Lipid composition, thermal properties, polymorphism, isothermal crystallization behaviour, nanostructure and microstructure of FHPKO, FHPKO-triacylglycerol (TAG), FHCNO and FHCNO-TAG were evaluated. Removal of minor components had no effect on triglycerides composition. However, the presence of the minor components did increase the slip melting point and promote onset of crystallization. Furthermore, the thickness of the nanoscale crystals increased, and polymorphic transformation from beta' to beta occurred in FHPKO after the removal of minor components, and from a to beta' in FHCNO. Sharp changes in the values of the Avrami constant K and exponent n suggested that the presence of minor components changed the crystal growth mechanism. The PLM results indicated that a coarser crystal structure with lower fractal dimension appeared after the removal of minor components from both FHPKO and FHCNO.

AB In this study ginseng saponins (GS) were used as natural emulsifiers to formulate and stabilize O/W nanoemulsions loaded with astaxanthin (AST). GS were found to be highly effective at reducing the interfacial tension at the soybean oil-water interfaces, and were capable of producing nano-scaled droplets (d(4),(3) approximate to 125nm) using a high-pressure homogenizer. The droplet size of the nanoemulsions decreased with increasing emulsifier concentration and homogenization pressure. The nanoemulsions were stable without droplet coalescence against thermal treatment (30-90 degrees C, 30min), and over a narrow range of pH values (7-9). GS-coated droplets were unstable in acidic conditions (pH 3-6) and in the presence of salt (> 25mM NaCl). The formulated nanoemulsions showed slight change in d4,3 during 15 days of storage at 5, 25 and 40 degrees C. However, the chemical stability strongly depended on the storage temperature, with the lowest level of AST retained in nanoemulsions stored at higher temperature.

AB Reverse micelles (RMs) as nanocarriers of nisin were optimized for the highest water and bacteriocin content. RMs formulated with either refined olive oil or sunflower oil, distilled monoglycerides, ethanol, and water were effectively designed. Structural characterization of the RMs was assessed using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Small Angle X-ray Scattering in the presence and absence of nisin. No conformational changes occurred in the presence of nisin for the nanocarriers. To assess efficacy of the loaded systems, their antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes was tested in lettuce leaves and minced meat, respectively. Antimicrobial activity was evident in both cases. Interestingly, a synergistic antimicrobial effect was observed in lettuce leaves and to a lesser extent in minced meat between nisin and some of the nanocarriers' constituents (probably ethanol). Our findings suggest complex interactions that take place when RMs are applied in different food matrices.

AB Nanozyme-based electrochemical sensors have attracted much attention because of their low cost, sensitivity and remarkable stability under extensive environmental and industrial conditions. Interestingly, the physical characteristics of the nanomaterials in terms of size, shape, composition, surface area and porosity dominate the electrochemical processes at electrode surfaces. Herein, we explore nickel oxide nanoplatelets (NPs) modified screen-printed electrode-based nanozyme sensors that displays high electrochemical activity including stability, sensitivity, selectivity and applicability for organophosphate pesticide (Parathion) determination. Differential pulse voltammogram of NiO-SPE in presence of parathion showed a characteristic peak current at -1.0 V (vs. Ag/AgCl). The NiO-SPE platform allows determination of parathion over the concentration range of 0.1-30 mu M with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.024 mu M. The sensing platform is found to detect parathion of interferences without compromising the sensitivity of the sensor. Such interesting features offer a sensitive determination of parathion in water, urine and vegetable samples.

AB Skates and rays are commercially important fish in South Korea, and among them, Beringraja pulchra has the highest economic value. However, the similar morphological traits among skates and rays are often exploited for seafood fraud. Here, we designed both Beringraja pulchra-specific and skate-universal primer sets, capable of detecting short sequences in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene, and developed highly sensitive and reliable quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays to differentiate between Beringraja pulchra and other skate and ray species. A Delta Cq method based on differences in the amplification efficiency was developed, validated, and then used to confirm the presence of Beringraja pulchra in twenty-six commercial skate products. The average Delta Cq value obtained for other skate species (18.94 +/- 3.46) was significantly higher than that of Beringraja pulchra (1.18 +/- 0.15). For on-site applications, we developed an ultra-fast qPCR assay, allowing for completion of the entire analytical procedure within 30 min.

AB This study investigated the biochemical changes (proteins degradation, total volatile basic nitrogen, biogenic amines, volatile organic compounds, nucleotides catabolism and related enzymes) of bighead carp samples inoculated with four different bacteria (Shewanella putrefaciens, Aeromonas sobria, Acinetobacter bohemicus, and Pseudomonas helmanticensis) during storage at 4 +/- 1 degrees C. A. sobria exhibited the strongest proteolytic activity. A. sobria, P. helmanticensis, and S. putrefaciens were responsible for putrescine production, whereas S. putrefaciens was the sole producer of cadaverine. Alcohols and S-compounds were mainly released by A. sobria and S. putrefaciens, respectively. The fastest degradation rates of hypoxanthine riboside and hypoxanthine were found in samples inoculated with P. helmanticensis and S. putrefaciens. Inosine nucleosidase was mainly resulted by A. sobria, P. helmanticensis and S. putrefaciens, whereas xanthine oxidase was derived from both fish muscle and secretions of P. helmanticensis and S. putrefaciens.

AB Natural occurrence of beta-carotene in bovine milk and the leading role of milk proteins in low-fat or fat-free dairy products necessitate investigating the possibility of interaction between beta-carotene and casein constituting up to 80% of bovine milk proteins. In this study, molecular interaction of caseins and beta-carotene was analyzed using fluorescence, UV-Vis absorption, circular dichroism (CD), and computer-aided molecular modeling. Casein and its fractions were bound to beta-carotene with a binding constant of the order 10(4)M(-1) and a 1:1 binding stoichiometry. The binding was favored at alkaline pHs, low ionic strength and temperatures kappa-Casein had the highest binding affinity to beta-carotene, among casein fractions. The negative values of entropy and enthalpy changes and docking studies proved Van der Waals interactions are predominant forces in the binding process. The casein conformation was also altered through inducing a more folded structure in beta-casein and a looser conformation in alpha- and kappa-casein.

AB In the fruit juice industry, high pressure (HP) processing has become a commercial success. However, enzymatic browning, cloud loss, and flavor changes during storage remain challenges. The aim of this study is to combine kiwifruit puree and HP pasteurization (600 MPa/3 min) to stabilize cloudy apple juice during storage at 4 degrees C. A wide range of targeted and untargeted quality characteristics was evaluated using a multivariate approach. Due to high ascorbic acid content and high viscosity, kiwifruit puree allowed to prevent enzymatic browning and phase separation of an apple-kiwifruit mixed juice. Besides, no clear changes in organic acids, viscosity, and particle size distribution were detected in mixed juice during storage. Sucrose of apple and mixed juices decreased with glucose and fructose increasing during storage. The volatile changes of both juices behaved similar, mainly esters being degraded. Sensory evaluation demonstrated consumer preferred the aroma of mixed juice compared to apple juice.

AB The physicochemical and emulsification characteristics of flaxseed albumin and globulin protein fractions were determined in this study. Flaxseed protein meal was extracted with 0.5M NaCl, and the extract dialyzed against water followed by centrifugation to obtain the globulin as a water-insoluble precipitate and albumin as the water-soluble albumin. Gel electrophoresis data indicate that the globulin is composed of several polypeptides in the 10-50 kDa range while albumin consisted mainly of the 10 kDa polypeptide accompanied by a minor content of 40 kDa. Amino acid analysis showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of hydrophobic amino acids in the globulin, which was consistent with higher surface hydrophobicity when compared to the albumin. All the emulsions had monomodal oil droplet size distribution and wider ranges were directly related to bigger sizes, especially at low (10 mg/mL) protein concentration when compared to the 50 mg/mL.

AB A novel analytical method for melamine in milk powder has been developed and exploited with three-dimensional (3D) magnetic molecularly imprinted polymers (MMIPs) combining with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The 3D MMIPs were synthesized with graphene-carbon nanotube hybrid composite as carrier which can increase the accessible surface area. The products were characterized, and the binding affinity was investigated by isothermal absorption, kinetic adsorption and selective adsorption. The results showed that the 3D MMIPs exhibited high adsorption capacity with maximum adsorption capacity of 123.1 mg g(-1), fast adsorption rate (10 min) and high selectivity toward melamine. Various affecting extraction parameters were evaluated. The limit of detection was 0.00045 mg kg(-1) and the recoveries were ranged from 90.3% to 95.7%. The precisions (RSDs) were lower than 4.7%. This method was applied for analyzing six milk powder samples. The result was in agreement with that obtained by the state standard method used in China.

AB The current study comparatively investigated the heat-induced polymerization behavior of fresh and frozen-stored gluten to replenish the gluten deterioration mechanism in frozen dough from the perspective of subsequent polymerization behavior during heating. The results showed that disulfide-mediated polymerization of frozen-stored gluten upon heating at 95 degrees C was suppressed. The polymerization ability of glutenin was weakened rather than gliadin for frozen-stored gluten. Enhanced level of beta-structures at the expense of alpha-helices was detected during the incipient heating of fresh gluten, while converse trend was noticed for the frozen-stored gluten. Frozen-stored gluten exhibited less exposure of surface hydrophobic groups during the initial heating, suggesting that it was less responsive to the unfolding process. The weakened viscoelastic properties of frozenstored gluten throughout heating protocols were mainly originated from glutenin macropolymer depolymerization as well as the hindered formation of glutenin-gliadin crosslinking and non-covalent bonds.

AB Photostability of all-trans retinyl palmitate (RP) (100% bioactivity) was studied in policosanol oleogels (PCOs) (7-12% w/w policosanol in soybean oil) after UVA irradiation. RP was incorporated into PCOs at levels of 0.04%, 0.1% and 1% (w/w). PCOs efficiently protected RP from UVA-mediated degradation. Over 75% RP-activity remained in PCOs after 4 days of UVA irradiation, while 12% RP-activity remained in soybean oil. HPLC analysis showed that cis-RP was formed in liquid soybean oil after 2 days of UVA irradiation while it was absent in PCOs matrices. PCOs blocked the energy absorption from UVA and further dampened the UVA-mediated ionic photodissociation and free radical reaction due to matrix immobilization. For all samples, RP photodegradation followed a 2nd order reaction. From the reaction kinetics, it would be possible to predict the RP photodegradation rate in PCO matrices. PCOs were shown to be a promising matrix to protect RP from photodegradation.

AB A fraction of annatto is often transferred to the whey fluid during Cheddar cheese processing, which negatively impacts the visual and sensory attributes of the resultant whey powder. Alternatives to reduce the color in the powder are still needed. In this study, casein-chitosan complexes were prepared to deliver annatto preferentially to the curd and reduce the amount of carryover colorant in whey powder. These complexes were relatively spherical, with a mean complex diameter of 8.3 +/- 1.9 mu m, zeta-potential of +39.4 +/- 1.3 mV, and entrapment efficiency of 38.2 +/- 3.1%. FT-IR spectroscopy confirmed the electrostatic interaction between casein and chitosan. Complexes and commercial annatto powder were incorporated into homogenized, reduced-fat, and fat-free milk, and subjected to acid coagulation. Whey powder produced from casein-chitosan-complex-treated samples exhibited better color quality than that prepared with annatto powder, indicating that the approach considered in this study was efficient in preventing the migration of colorant to the whey.

AB The goal of this study was to evaluate patulin contamination in 'Galaxy' and 'Fuji Kiku' apples subjected to controlled atmosphere (CA) and dynamic controlled atmosphere (DCA) conditions. Experiments were performed and fruit were stored for nine months under refrigeration plus 7 days shelf life at 20 degrees C. CA and DCA were not effective in preventing patulin production in either 'Galaxy' or 'Fuji Kiku' apples. Healthy fruit were not contaminated with patulin, even when stored together with decayed apples. For 'Galaxy' apples, application of 1-methylcyclopropene increased the percentage of fruit with decay and patulin contamination. Patulin concentrations were above the maximum limit (50 mu g kg(-1)) established in the Brazilian legislation, meaning the use of CA and DCA conditions were not advantageous in preventing patulin accumulation. In 'Fuji Kiku' apples, there was no significant difference in patulin concentration among CA, DCA-CF and DCA-RQ 1.3 treatments, and all were below the maximum.

AB 2-Mercapto-3-methyl-1-butanol (2M3MB) imparts an onion-like off-flavor to beer and is believed to result from the hot aeration of brewer's wort. However, little has been reported regarding the mechanism of formation of 2M3MB. This paper investigates the precursors of 2M3MB formed during the brewing process. Our study of a cysteine conjugate as a precursor showed its negligible contribution to the formation of 2M3MB. The 2M3MB precursor was found to be a volatile compound because 2M3MB was formed in the distillate of hop extract. The precursor was purified through distillation, column chromatography, and preparative gas chromatography, and the 2M3MB-producing potential was measured as an index for estimating the concentration of the precursor. The accurate mass of the precursor was measured using gas chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (GC/QTOF). The molecular structure was identified from the product ion spectra by GC/QTOF to be 2,3-epoxy-3-methylbutanal.

AB Sodium caseinate (CAS) and commercial sodium alginate (CA), long chain modified alginate (LCMA) or short chain modified alginate (SCMA) were used in combination for emulsifying and stabilizing high fat (50-70%) fish oil-in-water emulsions. Physical (creaming, droplet size, viscosity and protein determination) and oxidative (primary and secondary oxidation products) stabilities of the emulsions were studied during 12 days of storage. Creaming stability was higher for emulsions produced with alginates and CAS compared to emulsions prepared with only CAS. Combined use of CAS + LCMA performed better in terms of physical stability compared to emulsions produced with only CAS. However, the oxidative stability of this emulsion was inferior probably due to the presence of an unsaturated carbon chain in LCMA structure. CAS + SCMA emulsions not only showed better physical stability such as smaller droplet size, lower creaming and higher viscosity, but also had an improved oxidative stability than emulsions produced with only CAS.

AB Caramel colours are used by the food industry in a wide range of foods and beverages. During their manufacturing, low molecular weight compounds such as 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI), the structural isomer of 4-MEI, 2-methylimidazole (2-MEI) and 2-acetyl-4-tetrahydroxy-butylimidazole (THI) are generated. The presence of these inevitable by-products of caramel manufacturing can be hazardous to human health. This publication describes an isotope dilution Ultra-High-performance Liquid Chromatography tandem mass spectrometric method (UHPLC-MS/MS) that was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of these impurities in both beverages/liquids and foods. A limit of quantification of 5 mu g/kg was obtained for 4-MEI and THI. The expanded measurement uncertainty (U; k = 2) for these compounds was below 51% in beverages/liquids and below 56% in foods. As higher measurement uncertainties were obtained for 2-MEI, the developed analytical procedure can only be used in a semi-quantitative way for this compound.

AB A novel ethanol-induced composite hydrogel was prepared by two edible biopolymers: propylene glycol alginate (PGA) and zein. The effect of pH and different mass ratios of PGA and zein on the properties of the composite hydrogel was investigated. PGA and zein could form a gel induced by ethanol at pH >= 3.5, the stability, springiness, hardness and water holding capacity were decreased from pH 3.5 to 5.0. The hydrogen-bonding association was enhanced at pH 3.5 and porous structure was observed. The strength and springiness of the composite hydrogel decreased with increasing concentration of zein until the PGA/zein mass ratio was 5:1. At PGA/zein mass ratio of 5:1, the composite hydrogel exhibited a more elastic and tougher structure than other mass ratios at pH 3.5. Meanwhile, compared with the PGA hydrogel, the PGA-zein composite hydrogel showed great ability to sustain the release of curcumin in simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions.

AB The health hazard of tallow and partial hydrogenated oils is well known in margarine productions. For this, food manufactures are urged to develop novel alternatives for healthier margarine formulations. The highest inter-esterification degree acquired with lipase Lipozyme 435 standing out from other catalysts (solid acid, sodium hydroxide and methoxide) was applied to produce low trans margarine fat analogs to beef tallow (BT) with the blend of soybean oil (SO) and fully hydrogenated palm oil (FHPO) in a mass ratio of 4:3. Reaction parameters like enzyme dosage (4.2 wt%), temperature (95 degrees C) and time (245 min) were optimized using the Box-Behnken design. Regarding fatty acid profiles, triacylglycerol species, solid fat content, polymorphism, melting and crystallization behaviors, the resulting interesterified oil was characterized in comparison with BT, FHPO and the SO-FHPO blend so as to prove its potential in formulating low trans fat margarines because of desirable physicochemical properties and polymorphs.

AB Stipa purpurea is widely distributed on the Tibetan Plateau, and has high drought resistance. Plasma membrane intrinsic proteins are a type of aquaporin. They regulate the movement of water and are associated with plant protective reactions to biotic and abiotic stresses. We characterized a plasma membrane intrinsic protein from S. purpurea (SpPIP1) and elucidated its role in molecular aspects of the plant's response to drought stress. The full-length open reading frame of SpPIP1 was 870 bp and encoded 289 amino acids. The transcript level of SpPIP1 was higher in the root of S. purpurea than in the flower, leaf and stem. The level of SpPIP1 transcript increased significantly when treated with drought treatment. Subcellular localization result showed that SpPIP1 was localized in the plasma membrane. Ectopic expression of SpPIP1 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in plants with higher tolerance to drought treatment. SpPIP1 of S. purpurea may mediate plant response to arid environments.

AB Trehalases are a group of enzymes that catalyse the conversion of trehalose to glucose, and they are observed in most organisms. In this study, the first echinoderm trehalase, designated Hl-Tre, was identified from a tropical sea cucumber, Holothuria leucospilota. The full-length cDNA of H. leucospilota trehalase (Hl-Tre) is 2461 bp in length with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1788 bp that encodes a 595-amino-acid protein with a deduced molecular weight of 67.95 KDa. The Hl-Tre protein contains a signal peptide at the N terminal and a functional trehalase domain, which includes the signature motifs 1 and 2. The mRNA expression of Hl-Tre was ubiquitously detected in all selected tissues, with the highest level being detected in the intestine. By in situ hybridization (ISH), the positive Hl-Tre signals were observed in the brush borders of the intestinal mucosa. In embryonic and larval stages, the transcript levels of Hl-Tre decreased during embryonic development and increased after the pentactula stage. After a challenge of starvation, the intestinal Hl-Tre mRNA levels were observed to be first decreased and partially recovered thereafter. Overall, our study provided the first evidence for trehalase in echinoderms and showed that this enzyme was potentially linked to a trehalose metabolic pathway in sea cucumbers.

AB Background: Jujube witches' broom (JWB), caused by a phytoplasma, devastates jujube tree (Ziziphus jujuba) growth and production in Asia. Although host responses to phytoplasmas are studied at the phenotypic, physiological, biochemical and molecular levels, it remains unclear how a host plant responds at the molecular level during the primary stage of infection.
   Methods: To understand the response of the jujube tree to JWB infection, leaves were sampled at different times during the phytoplasma infection. Transcriptomic analyses at six stages were performed to reveal how phytoplasma infection affects Chinese jujube gene expression through the determination of the key differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and their related pathways. Quantitative real-time PCR was applied to validate 10 differentially expressed genes at different JWB phytoplasma infection stages.
   Results: A total of 25,067 unigenes were mapped to jujube genome reference sequences. In the first infection stage (0-2 weeks after grafting (WAG), a total of 582 jujube genes were differentially regulated but no visible symptoms appeared. Quite a few DEGs related to abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin (CTK) were down-regulated, while some related to jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) were up-regulated, Genes related to plant-pathogen interaction were also differentially expressed. In the second infection stage (37-39WAG), witches' broom symptoms were visible, and a total of 4373 DEGs were identified. Genes involved in biosynthesis and signal transduction of ABA, brassinosteroid (BR), CTK, ethylene (ET), and auxin (IAA), GA, JA and SA, plant-pathogen interaction, flavonoid biosynthesis genes were significantly regulated, suggesting that jujube trees activated defense factors related to SA, JA, ABA and secondary metabolites to defend against phytoplasma infection. By the third infection stage (48 52WAG), serious symptoms occurred and 3386 DEGs were identified. Most DEGs involved in biosynthesis and signal transduction of JA, SA and GA were up-regulated, while those relating to ABA were down-regulated. Genes involved in plant-pathogen interaction were up- or down-regulated, while phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosynthesis genes were significantly up-regulated. Meanwhile, DEGs involved in photosynthesis, chlorophyll and peroxisome biosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism were downregulated. These results suggested that phytoplasma infection had completely destroyed jujube trees' defense system and had disturbed chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthetic activity in the infected leaves at the late stage, resulting in yellow leaves and other JWB symptoms
   Discussion: The results in this report suggested that phytohormone biosynthesis and signal transduction, photosynthesis, and secondary metabolism all played important roles in the battle between colonization and defense in the interaction between Ca. Phytoplasma ziziphi and jujube.

AB As an essential mediator in the Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) signaling pathway, GnRH receptor (GnRHR) coupled to GnRH, plays an important role in activating the downstream pathway after stimulating a series of cascades to regulate reproduction. To detect the existence of GnRHR and potential GnRH signaling pathway, we cloned and characterized GnRHR in the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis (named EsGnRHR). The full-length EsGnRHR cDNA is 2038 bp in length, including an open reading frame (ORF) of 1566 bp, a 57 bp 5'-untranslated region (5' UTR) and a 415 bp 3'-UTR. Prediction of transmembrane domains in protein sequence revealed that the EsGnRHR protein contained seven hydrophobic transmembrane regions (TMs). Reverse transcription PCR revealed that EsGnRHR was mainly expressed in the thoracic nerve group and ovary, and weakly distributed in the testis and brain. In situ hybridization further demonstrated that EsGnRHR mRNA was localized at the protocerebrum and deutocerebrum. In the ovary and testis, the hybridization signal was dominantly at the earlier developmental stages. The signal was mainly localized in the cytoplasm cell in the ovary, and in the epithelium cell in the testis. During the different stages of gonadal development, EsGnRHR displayed increasing trends in both female and male when analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, suggesting that EsGnRHR was involved in controlling gonadal development. Our study provides important information for further research on the molecular mechanisms underlying crab development.

AB Inbreeding depression is the reduction in fitness observed in inbred populations. In plants, it leads to disease, weaker resistance to adverse environmental conditions, inhibition of growth, and decrease of yield. To elucidate molecular mechanisms behind inbreeding depression, we compared global DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles of a normal and a highly inbred heading degenerated variety of the Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis). DNA methylation was reduced in inbred plants, suggesting a change in the epigenetic landscape. Transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq revealed that genes in auxin-response and synthesis pathways were differentially expressed in the inbreeding depression lines. Interestingly, methylation levels of some of those genes were also changed. Furthermore, endogenous IAA content was decreased in inbred plants, in agreement with expression and methylation data. Chemical inhibition of auxin also replicated the degenerated phenotype in normal plants, while exogenous IAA application had no effect in inbred depression plants, suggesting a more complex mechanism. These data indicate DNA methylation-regulated auxin pathways play a role in establishing inbred depression phenotypes in plants. Our findings reveal new insights into inbreeding depression and leafy head development in Chinese cabbage.

AB Small photosynthetic eukaryotes play important roles in oceanic food webs in coastal regions. We investigated seasonal changes in the communities of photosynthetic picoeukaryotes (PPEs) of the class Mamiellophyceae, including the genera Bathycoccus, Micromonas and Ostreococcus, in Ofunato Bay, which is located in northeastern Japan and faces the Pacific Ocean. The abundances of PPEs were assessed over a period of one year in 2015 at three sampling stations, KSt. 1 (innermost bay area), KSt. 2 (middle bay area) and KSt. 3 (bay entrance area) at depths of 1 m (KSt. 1, KSt. 2 and KSt. 3), 8 m (KSt. 1) or 10 m (KSt. 2 and KSt. 3) by employing MiSeq shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The total abundances of Bathycoccus, Ostreococcus and Micromonas were in the ranges of 42-49%, 35-49% and 13-17%, respectively. Considering all assayed sampling stations and depths, seasonal changes revealed high abundances of PPEs during the winter and summer and low abundances during late winter to early spring and late summer to early autumn. Bathycoccus was most abundant in the winter, and Ostreococcus showed a high abundance during the summer. Another genus, Micromonas, was relatively low in abundance throughout the study period. Taken together with previously suggested blooming periods of phytoplankton, as revealed by chlorophyll a concentrations in Ofunato Bay during spring and autumn, these results for PPEs suggest that greater phytoplankton blooming has a negative influence on the seasonal occurrences of PPEs in the bay.

AB The cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that contributes to the regulation of gluconeogenesis. The mechanisms of the CREB1 function remain largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to explore genetic variations in CREB1 promoter region and determine whether these loci affect transcriptional activity and risk on type 2 diabetes (T2D). Three polymorphisms were identified and designated as MU1, MU2 and MU3, respectively. Genotypic distribution analysis revealed that MU1 genotypes presented similar distribution between T2D and healthy controls (P > 0.05), while the MU2 and MU3 showed significant differences (P < 0.05). Haplotypic blocks of the three loci were constructed, and H1-TGA, H2-11 1. and H3-ATT had higher frequencies in T2D patients than those in controls. Association studies revealed that the three loci significantly affected plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin and insulin secretion. Disequilibrium analysis identified that the MU2 and MU3 variants were strongly linked in T2D (r(2) = 0.348, D' = 1.0). Further analysis indicated that MU2 (TT vs GG, OR = 2.38, 95%CI = 1.19 4.77, P = 0.01) and MU3 (AA vs TT, OR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.19-4.77, P = 0.04) were significantly associated with T2D in dominant genotypes. Luciferase assay showed that T-A haplotype from the highly linked MU2 and MU3 exhibited maximal promoter activity, which was consistent with the correlation results. We concluded that the TT genotype of MU2 and the AA genotype of MU3 could be used as molecular markers for evaluating the risk on T2D.

AB Nanocrystals hold great potential as parenteral delivery carrier systems for poorly water-soluble drugs. Elucidation of the in vivo fate of parenteral nanocrystals is of pharmacological, toxicological and mechanistic significance. However, it is of tremendous difficulty to monitor real-time translocation of nanocrystals in vivo owing to progressive dissolution of nanocrystals and a lack of workable tools to probe nanocrystals. In this study, self-discriminating hybrid nanocrystals (SDHNs) of a model drug curcumin (CUR) were developed by embedding traces of environment-responsive fluorescent dyes into the crystalline lattices of CUR. The SDHNs glow, but the released dyes aggregate and quench spontaneously due to the aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effect. Following intravenous administration into rats, a large fraction of CUR nanocrystals are cleared from blood rapidly and accumulate mainly in liver and lung. A small fraction circulate in blood for at least 48 h. Long circulating might be attributable to the surface coating with poloxamer 188, a stabilizer used during preparation; nevertheless, the ultimate fate of nanocrystals ends in reticulo-endothelial organs and tissues. It is implied that parenteral delivery provide sustained release and prolonged pharmacological efficacy, but concomitantly raise concerns of local toxicity in vital organs and tissues, especially when the active ingredients are highly toxic.

AB The technological utility of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is greatly enhanced when they are transformed into ionic liquids (ILs). API ILs have better solubility, thermal stability, and the efficacy in topical delivery than solid or crystalline drugs. However, toxicological issue of API ILs is the main challenge for their application in drug delivery. To address this issue, 11 amino acid esters (AAEs) were synthesized and investigated as biocompatible counter cations for the poorly water-soluble drug salicylic acid (Sal) to form Sal-ILs. The AAEs were characterized using H-1 and C-13 NMR, FTIR, elemental, and thermogravimetric analyses. The cytotoxicities of the AAE cations, Sal-ILs, and free Sal were investigated using mammalian cell lines (L929 and HeLa). The toxicities of the AAE cations greatly increased with inclusion of long alkyl chains, sulfur, and aromatic rings in the side groups of the cations. Ethyl esters of alanine, aspartic acid, and proline were selected as a low cytotoxic AAE. The cytotoxicities of the Sal-ILs drastically increased compared with the AAEs on incorporation of Sal into the cations, and were comparable to that of free Sal. Interestingly, the water miscibilities of the Sal-ILs were higher than that of free Sal, and the Sal-ILs were miscible with water at any ratio. A skin permeation study showed that the Sal-ILs penetrated through skin faster than the Sal sodium salt. These results suggest that AAEs could be used in biomedical applications to eliminate the use of traditional toxic solvents for transdermal delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs.

AB Appropriate selection of excipient grade during tablet formulation development depends on thorough knowledge in their compaction and flow properties. Each chemically unique pharmaceutical excipient is usually available in several commercial grades that are widely different in powder properties, which influence their performance for a specific formulation application. In this work, 11 grades of mannitol were systematically characterized, in terms of their particulate, flow and tableting properties, and compared against 5 grades of lactose. Principal component analysis (PCA) identified significant correlations among selected variables, such as particle size, surface area, flowability, wall friction, plasticity parameter, tensile strength, and tablet brittleness. PCA also revealed similar grades of the two excipients, which may be used to select replacement grade, if needed, based on similarity in their overall properties.

AB A free radical polymerization method was adopted for the fabrication of hybrid hydrogel films based on acrylamide and polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate as plasticizing and crosslinking agents, respectively, to be employed as smart skin bandages. Electro-sensitivity, biocompatibility and proteolytic properties were conferred to the final polymer networks by introducing graphene oxide (0.5% w/w), gelatin or trypsin (10% w/w) in the polymerization feed. The physical chemical and mechanical characterization of hybrid materials was performed by means of determination of protein content, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and measurement of tensile strength. The evaluation of both water affinity and curcumin release profiles (analyzed by suitable mathematical modelling) upon application of an external electric stimulation in the 0-48 voltage range, confirmed the possibility to modulate the release kinetics. Proper proteolytic tests showed that the trypsin enzymatic activity was retained by 80% upon immobilization. Moreover, for all samples, we observed a viability higher than 94% in normal human fibroblast cells (MRC-5), while a reduction of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus CFU mL(-1) (90%) was obtained with curcumin loaded samples.

AB The work entails a novel strategy of formulating the lycopene loaded whey protein isolate nanoparticles (LYCWPI-NPs) solely using the rational blend of biomacromolecule without using equipment-intensive techniques. The LYC-WPI-NPs were fabricated as a substantial drug delivery platform, with maximum entrapment, spatial and controlled release manners, exceptional plasma concentration, and perspective for discrepancy delivery of therapeutics. Prepared nano-formulations were measured in ultra-fine size (100-350 nm) with sphere-shaped. The percent lycopene entrapment of prepared LYC-WPI-NPs was estimated in the range to 50 and 65%. In vitro percent cumulative release study demonstrated deaden and extended release i.e. approximately 75% following 16th h. The in vitro percent cell survival (cytotoxicity study) of prepared nanoparticles was evaluated against MCF-7 breast cancer cells by MTT based colorimetric assay. Sub-cellular localization of lycopene when delivered by LYC-WPI-NPs was assessed by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography). The WPI-NPs enhance the oral bioavailability of lycopene by controlling its release from nano-formulation and facilitating its absorption through lymphatic pathways. Prophylactic anticancer efficacy of LYC-WPI-NPs was evaluated thereafter on experimentally induced breast cancer animal model. Conclusively, it may quite reasonable that lycopene loaded protein nanoparticles are competent to improve the biopharmaceutical attributes of lycopene and demonstrated prophylactic anticancer activity, decrease tumor proliferation and increase the survival rate of treated animals, thus signifying their feasible usefulness in cancer therapeutic and intervention.

AB Amphiphilic hydrogels are widely reported as systems with great potential for controlled drug release. Nevertheless, the majority of studies make use of functionalization or attachment of drugs to the polymer chains. In this study, we propose a strategy of combining amphiphilic polyurethanes with pH-responsive drugs to develop smart drug carriers. While the amphiphilic character of the polymer imparts an efficient load of hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs, the drug's characteristics determine the selectivity of the medium delivery. Drug loading and release behavior as well as hydrolytic degradation of chemically crosslinked polyurethane hydrogels based on PEG and PCL-triol (PU (polyurethane) hydrogels) synthesized by an easy one-pot route were studied. PU hydrogels have been shown to successfully load the hydrophobic acidic drug sodium diclofenac, reaching a partition coefficient of 8 between the most hydrophobic PU and diclofenac/ethanol solutions. Moreover, an oral administration simulation was conducted by changing the environment from an acidic to a neutral medium. PU hydrogels release less than 5% of the drug in an acidic medium; however, in a PBS pH 7.4 solution, diclofenac is delivered in a sustained fashion for up to 40 h, achieving 80% of cumulative release.

   TABLETS; RELEASE; MEDICINE; DESIGN; FABRICATION
AB Binder jetting and material extrusion are the two most common additive manufacturing techniques used to create pharmaceutical tablets. However, their versatility is limited since the powder component is present throughout the dosage forms fabricated by binder jet 3D printing and material extrusion 3D printing requires high operating temperatures. Conversely, material jetting allows for compositional control at a voxel level and can dispense material at room temperature. Unfortunately, there are a limited number of materials that are both printable and biocompatible. Therefore, the aim of this study was to engineer photocurable bioinks that are suitable for hydrophobic active pharmaceutical ingredients and have rapid gelation times upon visible light exposure. The resulting bioinks were comprised of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (250 Da) as the crosslinkable monomer, Eosin Y as the photoinitiator, and methoxide-poly(ethylene glycol)-amine as the coinitiator. Additionally, poly(ethylene glycol) (200 Da) was added as a plasticizer to modulate the drug release profiles, and Naproxen was used as the model drug due to its high hydrophobicity. Various bioink formulations were dispensed into the bottom half of blank preform tablets - made via direct compression - using a piezoelectric nozzle, photopolymerized, and capped with the top half of the preform tablet to complete the pharmaceutical dosage form. Results from the release studies showed that drug release can be modulated by both the percent of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate in the formulation and the light exposure time used to cure the bioinks. These bioinks have the potential to expand the library of materials available for creating pharmaceutical tablets via inkjet printing with personalized drug dosages.

   Regulatory approval
AB Novel excipients are indispensable in development of modern, advanced drug delivery systems and biotechnology-derived drugs. Although numerous novel excipients are developed for pharmaceutical use, they are not frequently seen in medicinal products due to the strict regulatory requirements and perception that their use makes new product evaluation more complex with risk of delays in the approval process. Regulators regard novel excipients as new substances and whenever new excipient is used in a formulation it must be subjected to full evaluation, similarly to the one required for new active substance. Consequently, the amount of information required in support of the regulatory approval (i.e. marketing authorization) is much more complex and comprehensive than for established excipients. This short review provides an insight into the use of novel excipients in medicinal products approved in the European Union. In addition, barriers and challenges in development of novel excipients are being discussed as well as means to overcome those barriers.

AB Many pharmaceuticals such as pills, capsules, or tablets are prepared in a dried and powdered form. In this field, spray drying plays a critical role to convert liquid pharmaceutical formulations into powders. In addition, in many cases it is necessary to encapsulate bioactive drugs into wall materials to protect them against harsh process and environmental conditions, as well as to deliver the drug to the right place and at the correct time within the body. Thus, spray drying is a common process used for encapsulation of pharmaceuticals. In view of the rapid progress of nanoencapsulation techniques in pharmaceutics, nano spray drying is used to improve drug formulation and delivery. The nano spray dryer developed in the recent years provides ultrafine powders at nanoscale and high product yields. In this paper, after explaining the concept of nano spray drying and understanding the key elements of the equipment, the influence of the process parameters on the final powders properties, like particle size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, drug loading and release, will be discussed. Then, numerous application examples are reviewed for nano spray drying and encapsulation of various drugs in the early stages of product development along with a brief overview of the obtained results and characterization techniques.

AB Inline dry powder inhalers (DPIs) offer a potentially effective option to deliver high dose inhaled medications simultaneously with mechanical ventilation. The objective of this study was to develop an inline DPI that is actuated using a low volume of air (LV-DPI) to efficiently deliver pharmaceutical aerosols during low flow nasal cannula (LFNC) therapy. A characteristic feature of the new inline LV DPIs was the use of hollow capillary tubes that both pierced the capsule and provided a pathway for inlet air and exiting aerosol. Aerosolization characteristics, LFNC depositional losses and emitted dose (ED) were determined using 10 mg powder masses of a small-particle excipient enhanced growth (EEG) formulation. While increasing the number of inlet capillaries from one to three did not improve performance, retracting the inlet and outlet capillaries did improve ED by over 30%. It was theorized that high quality performance requires both high turbulent energy to deaggregate the powder and high wall shear stresses to minimize capsule retention. Best case performance included a device ED of approximately 85% (of loaded dose) and device emitted mass median aerodynamic diameter of 1.77 limo Maximum ED through the LFNC system and small diameter (4 mm) nasal cannula was approximately 65% of the loaded dose. Potential applications of this device include the delivery of high dose inhaled medications such as surfactants, antibiotics, mucolytics, and anti-inflammatories.

AB We explored the potential of two types of sorbitan ester nanoparticles (SENS) as novel tools for topical ocular drug delivery. The optimized SENS formulation (SENS-OPT) consisted of nanoparticles (NPs) of 170.5 nm, zeta potential + 33.9 mV, and cyclosporine loading of 19.66%. After hyaluronic acid (HA) coating, the resulting SENS-OPT-HA NPs had a particle size of 177.6 nm and zeta potential of -20.6 mV. The NPs were stable during 3 months of storage at different temperatures and did not aggregate in the presence of protein-enriched simulated lacrimal fluid. There was no toxicity to cultured human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells when exposed to NPs up to 0.4% (w/v). Both NPs were effectively internalized by HCE cells through active mechanisms. Endocytosis of SENS-OPT NPs was caveolin-dependent whereas SENS-OPT-HA NP endocytosis was mediated by HA receptors. HA-receptor-mediated endocytosis may be responsible for the higher cellular uptake of SENS-OPT-HA NPs. After cyclosporine incorporation into the NPs, corneal penetration of this immunosuppressive drug by loaded SENS-OPT NPs was 1.3-fold higher than the commercial reference formulation Sandimmun (R). For cyclosporine-loaded SENS-OPT-HA NPs, the penetration was 2.1-fold higher than for Sandimmun (R). In ex vivo stimulated lymphocytes, both formulations demonstrated the same reduction in IL-2 levels as Sandimmun (R).

AB Docetaxel (DTX) solution is among the most widely-used parenteral formulations used in advanced breast cancer therapy. However, severe side effects have been observed due to the use of ethanol and polysorbate 80. Herein, a novel DTX-based prodrug, docetaxel-linoleic acid conjugate (DTX-LA) was successfully synthesized. The high lipid solubility of DTX and DTX-LA resulted in a tendency for them to become entrapped in the oil core of the emulsions. As anticipated, nano-sized, sterically stabilized oil-in-water lipid emulsions (LMs) of DTX-LA LMs and DTX LMs were successfully constructed. Unlike DTX solution, LMs exhibited high colloidal stability and sustained-release behavior, having a narrow size distribution that was similar to 220 nm in diameter. Compared with DTX LMs, DTX-LA LMs had a greater drug-loading capacity. Although the cytotoxicity of DTX-LA LMs was reduced in comparison with DTX solution, the pharmacokinetic study demonstrated increased bioavailability (p < 0.001) and half-life (p < 0.01). Finally, DTX-LA LMs displayed significant antitumor efficacy with reduced side effects in a 4T1 breast cancer xenograft model. Thus, the novel lipid emulsion-based docetaxel prodrug delivery system may be a promising strategy for improving intravenous administration for breast cancer treatment.

AB Aim: The purpose of this study was to develop a novel thiolated starch polymer with improved mucoadhesive properties by conjugation of cysteamine to starch as a natural polymer of restricted mucoadhesive properties.
   Methods: Aldehyde substructures were integrated into starch via oxidative cleavage of vicinal diols by increasing amounts of sodium periodate followed by covalent attachment of cysteamine to oxidized starch via reductive amination. Thiol groups were quantified via Ellman's reaction and their impact on mucoadhesion was analyzed by rheological investigations, the rotating cylinder method and tensile studies on porcine mucosa.
   Results: The total amount of immobilized thiol groups revealed a correlation between degree of oxidation and thiolation. Modified starch demonstrated an up to 1.66-fold increase in water uptake in comparison to native starch. Modification of starch resulted in greatly improved cohesive properties and improvement in mucoadhesion. Rheological investigations revealed a 2- to 4-fold rise in viscosity of mucus. Tensile studies revealed a linear correlation between degree of oxidation/thiolation and enhancement of maximum detachment force and total work adhesion.
   Conclusion: In terms of these results, thiolated starch is a new, promising, polymer in the field of mucoadhesive drug delivery systems.

AB Agglomeration of pellets in fluidized bed coating processes is an undesirable phenomenon that affects the yield and quality of the product. In scope of PAT guidance, we present a system that utilizes visual imaging for in-line monitoring of the agglomeration degree. Seven pilot-scale Wurster coating processes were executed under various process conditions, providing a wide spectrum of process outcomes. Images of pellets were acquired during the coating processes in a contactless manner through an observation window of the coating apparatus. Efficient image analysis methods were developed for automatic recognition of discrete pellets and agglomerates in the acquired images. In-line obtained agglomeration degree trends revealed the agglomeration dynamics in distinct phases of the coating processes. We compared the in-line estimated agglomeration degree in the end point of each process to the results obtained by the off-line sieve analysis reference method. A strong positive correlation was obtained (coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.99), confirming the feasibility of the approach. The in-line estimated agglomeration degree enables early detection of agglomeration and provides means for timely interventions to retain it in an acceptable range.

AB Biomaterials for applications in the urinary tract are challenged with both biofilm formation and encrustation, two highly interconnected processes. While great effort has been achieved developing promising materials there is only a limited choice of sophisticated in vitro models that are available to analyse the performance of biomaterials prior to performing delicate and expensive in vivo studies. In this study we present a complex BioEncrustation model that imitates both the processes of multi-species biofilm formation and encrustation in vitro. The resulting crystalline biofilms are compared to the deposits found on explanted ureteral scent surfaces (in vivo situation) and to deposits formed in an experimental set up that does not contain bacteria (Encrustator (R)). Further focus of this study is dedicated to employing the developed BioEncrustation model to evaluate the effect multifunctional coatings impose on the processes of biofilm formation and encrustation under in vitro conditions. The investigated TANP coating combines unspecific and broad band specific antibacterial properties with a degrading polymer matrix that is intended to inhibit crystal formation. The coating was prepared on both polyurethane and silicone tubes and the subsequent results of the in vitro BioEncrustation analyses reveal a promising potential for employing the coating to render ureteral scent surfaces more biocompatible.

AB Preeclampsia is one of the most serious pregnancy complications. Many animal models have already been developed by researchers to study the pathogenesis and treatment of preeclampsia. However, most of these animal models were established by systemic administration or by surgery in the uterine cavity, which could lead to unwanted systemic toxicity or operative wounds and affect the accuracy of the results. Because of the high expression level of integrin alpha v beta 3 on the placenta, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid peptide (RGD) modified PEGylated cationic liposome (RGD Lip) was designed as a novel gene delivery system to target the placenta safely and efficiently, and a new animal model of preeclampsia was established through targeting of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA). The results of cellular uptake and endosomal localization showed that RGD-Lip enhanced cellular uptake and endosomal escape of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on HTR-8/SVneo. In vivo imaging revealed that RGD-Lip was selectively delivered to the placenta. Additionally, H19x siRNA was efficiently transferred into the placenta of C57BL/6 mice via the injection of H19x siRNA-loaded RGD-Lip, which could result in the occurrence of preeclampsia-like symptoms. In summary, RGD-Lip provided a platform to efficiently deliver siRNA to the placenta, and a new preeclampsia-like mouse model was developed targeting placenta enriched/specific genes, including noncoding RNAs.

AB A solventless process for simultaneously milling and dry coating microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) was investigated for producing fine excipients in five different sizes (similar to 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 mu m) having high bulk density (BD), good flow function coefficient (FFC), and excellent compaction. Avicel PH-102, used as the starting material, was milled and coated with two grades of silicas, hydrophobic and hydrophilic (R972P and A200), using a fluid energy mill (FEM). Through judicious selection of the FEM feed rate, feeding pressure, and grinding pressure, five desired milled sizes were produced. The bulk density of all the milled-coated (1 wt% A200) excipients was significantly better than uncoated-milled MCC, Avicel PH-102, and Prosolv 50 and 90. Whereas the FFC values were greater than uncoated-milled MCC, Avicel PH-102, and Prosolv 50 (latter for similar to 30, 35, and 40 mu m sizes). The tablet compaction testing was used to evaluate compactibility (tensile strength vs tablet porosity), compressibility (tablet porosity vs compaction pressure), and tabletibility (tensile strength vs compaction pressure). The results indicate that all finer grade milled and A200 coated MCC had lower porosity and higher tablet strengths than Prosolv 50 and 90 M all compaction pressures. Surprisingly, the BD and FFC were better for A200 than for R972P coated-milled MCCs; explained through analyzing inter-particle contact models. Finally, milling did not increase the moisture content but coating with silica led to a slight increase; A200 higher than R972P. It is hoped that these engineered excipients would help formulators with a multitude of options for finer excipients without loss of flow and bulk density.

AB Solubility parameters have been applied extensively in the chemical and pharmaceutical sciences. Particularly attractive is calculation of solubility parameters based on chemical structure and recently, new in silico methods have been proposed. Thus, screening charge densities of molecular surfaces (i.e. so-called sigma-profiles) are used by the conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS) and can be employed in a quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) to predict solubility parameters. In the current study, it was aimed to compare both in silico methods with an experimental dataset of pharmaceutical compounds, which was complemented with own measurements by inverse gas chromatography. An initial evaluation of the total solubility parameters of reference solvents resulted in excellent predictions (observed versus predicted values) with R-2 of 0.855 (COSMO-RS) and 0.945 (QSPR). The subsequent main study of pharmaceutical compounds exhibited R-2 values of 0.701 (COSMO-RS) and 0.717 (QSPR). The comparatively lower prediction was to some extent due to the solid state of pharmaceuticals with known conceptual limitations of the solubility parameter and possible experimental bias. Total solubility parameters were also estimated by classical group contribution methods, which had comparatively lower prediction power. Therefore, the new in silico methods are highly promising for pharmaceutical applications.

AB This paper introduces a rapid automated process-development approach for a continuous capsule-filling process. In our proposed method, both the material attributes and the critical process parameters were varied to understand and to optimize the overall process. Using our approach a statistical process model can be generated with unprecedented speed (2 days), which is the prerequisite for effectively developing and operating continuous process platforms. In a first set of experiments a process model was developed using different mixture compositions of ascorbic acid, lactose and magnesium stearate while changing simultaneously the critical process parameters of the capsule filler (speed, pressure, immersion depth and powder bed height). Targets of the model were the mean fill weight and the relative standard deviation of the produced capsules. In a second experimental set the model was tested, i.e., the goal was to predict the behavior of the system at different set points in order to predict weight and relative standard deviation for predefined targets. Predictions were very good, thus validating our approach. The combination of the rapid automated process development approach and the continuous capsule-filling process resulted in a new strategy for the development and manufacture of pharmaceutical dosage forms.

AB Carbopol is a good bio-adhesive polymer that increases the residence time in the eye. However, the effect of blinking and lacrimation still reduce the amount of polymer and the incorporated drug available for bioadhesion. Gel-core liposomes are advanced systems offering benefits making it a good tool for improved ocular drug delivery and residence time. Incorporation of carbopol in gel-core liposomes and their potential in ocular delivery have not so far been investigated. Fluconazole (FLZ) was selected as a challenging important ocular antifungal suffering from poor corneal permeation and short residence time. In this study, gel-core carbosomes have been elaborated as novel carbopol-based ophthalmic vehicles to solve ocular delivery obstacles of FLZ and to sustain its effect. Full in vitro appraisal was performed considering gel-core structure, entrapment efficiency, particle size and stability of the vesicles as quality attributes. Structure elucidation of the nanocarrier was performed using optical, polarizing and transmission electron microscopy before and after Triton-X100 addition. Ex-vivo ocular permeation and in vivo performance were investigated on male albino rabbits. Optimized formulation (CBS5) showed gel-core structure, nanosize (339.00 +/- 5.50 nm) and not defined before (62.00% +/- 1.73) entrapment efficiency. Cumulative amount of CBS5 permeated ex-vivo after 6 h, was 2.43 and 3.43 folds higher than that of conventional liposomes and FLZ suspension, respectively. In-vivo corneal permeation of CBS5 showed significantly higher AUCO-24 h (487.12 +/- 74.80) compared to that of FLZ suspension (204.34 +/- 7.46) with longer residence time in the eye lasts for more than 18 h. In conclusion, novel gel-core carbosomes could successfully be used as a promising delivery system for chronic ocular diseases.

AB Piezoelectric inkjet printing onto orodispersible films (ODFs) was proven to be a successful technique applying flexible doses of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) onto edible substrates. The reported API printing and ODF production was conducted in a non-continuous production approach. Within this study, drug-free and hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) containing ODFs should be imprinted in-line with enalapril maleate (EM) ink during continuous ODF production. Macrogol inks based on various solvents and solvent-water mixtures were developed providing dynamic viscosities from 7 to 17 mPa*s. Water based inks contained 1.25%, methanol based inks up to 10% EM. Both inks could be printed (500-1000 Hz) during continuous ODF production. No EM recrystallization was observed for water-based inks. Mechanical properties were not affected by drug printing using various firing frequencies. ODF imprinted with water-based EM inks contained 0.04 mg EM/6 cm(2). EM amount can be increased to a paediatric therapeutic dose of 0.5 mg EM utilizing methanol-based inks. These inks were successfully printed onto HCT ODFs resulting in a therapeutically relevant fixed-dose combination. No EM migration into the HCT layer could be observed. In conclusion, it was feasible to print EM doses onto drug-free and HCT ODFs during an in-line continuous manufacturing process.

AB Treating chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) by nebulization requires an airflow capable to deliver medication to deep target sites beyond the nasal valve. Fixed frequency acoustic airflow technology is currently available, mainly as post-surgical therapy, but still have not been able to realize the full potential of direct nose to paranasal sinuses delivery. Reported herein are the application of frequency sweep acoustic airflow and the optimization of its frequency range, sweep cycle duration and intensity.
   The resonant frequencies of the model's maxillary sinuses can be estimated using the Helmholtz resonator theory. Results indicated a resonant frequency of 479 Hz for the right maxillary sinus and one of 849 Hz for the left maxillary sinus. The highest intrasinus deposition within the experiments are from sweep cycle duration of 1 s, intensity of 80 dB, and frequency range of 100-850 Hz. The optimal range of frequency determined from experiments is in good agreement with the corresponding frequency range obtained from the Helmholtz resonator theory.
   Results reveal a significantly enhanced maxillary sinus drug deposition. This technique affords the potential of treating CRS.

   SELECTION; DECOMPOSITION; TEMPERATURE; NUCLEATION; DISCOVERY
AB Excipients are crucial components of most pharmaceutical formulations. In the case of a solid oral dosage formulation containing the salt form of a weakly ionizable drug, excipient selection is critical, as some excipients are known to cause salt disproportionation (conversion of salt to the free form). Therefore, robust formulation design necessitates an in-depth understanding of the factors impacting salt disproportionation during processing or storage as this can negatively impact product quality and performance. To date, there is an incomplete understanding of key excipient properties influencing salt disproportionation. Specifically, the potential roles of amorphous excipient glass transition temperature and excipient hygroscopicity, if any, on salt disproportionation are still not well understood. Furthermore, the relationship between the compression and the extent of salt disproportionation is an unknown factor. Herein, by utilizing various grades of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), its copolymer, copovidone (PVPVA), and magnesium stearate, a systematic investigation of disproportionation was performed using pioglitazone HCl as a model salt of a weak base. It was observed that there was a poor correlation between excipient hygroscopicity and the rate and extent of disproportionation. However, powder compression into compacts enhanced the rate and extent of disproportionation. This work focused on disproportionation of the salt of a weak base, as basic drugs are more prevalent, however, salts of weak acids may have similar tendencies under relevant conditions. The knowledge gained from this study will help in understanding the role of various excipients with respect to salt disproportionation, paving the way for designing stable salt formulations.

AB The purpose of this work was to develop a new supergeneric product Meloxicam/Omeprazole. Such a combination brings a benefit in terms of decreasing side effects for the patients using meloxicam. The new combination is composed of a meloxicam powder blend (MPB) and omeprazole gastro-resistant pellets (OAP) in hard gelatin capsules. The main tasks were to select the excipients to keep the functional layer of OAP active and to prove the bioequivalence to the original products of meloxicam tablets together with omeprazole capsules. Although dissolution profiles similar to the original product were obtained, the unexpected results of omeprazole low bioavailability in the fed bioequivalence study (BES I) showed the necessity to investigate the formulation in greater depth. A modified more complex dissolution method was developed in order to understand the release of omeprazole under gastric conditions. This method revealed the degradation of omeprazole in the formulation when exposed to the fed conditions because of the increase in microenvironmental pH in the capsule caused by trisodium citrate, commonly used for improving solubility of meloxicam. This pH increase dissolved the gastro-resistant layer of OAP and caused the chemical degradation. To prevent this effect, a trisodium citrate-free formulation was developed.

AB The implementation of Process Analytical Technology (PAT) instruments is generally achieved stochastically. Sub-optimal PAT locations could introduce variation in the measurements which is not related to the analyze of interest. For this reason, rational approaches should be considered to establish an optimal sensor placement where relevant measurements are possible and the impact of disturbances is minimized. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how mechanistic modelling can support appropriate sensor implementation by means of a case study. A PAT method was developed for a bottle filling process of a pharmaceutical formulation with the goal of increasing the yield of the process by gaining process understanding and redefining the endpoint of the process. To ensure proper measurements, an advanced measuring interfacing was assembled. The design of this device was rationalized with the help of a model-based approach using three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics modeling. This allows to maximize the performance of the PAT method and exploit its full benefits.

AB Soluplus (R) is a graft amphiphilic copolymer that is frequently used as an excipient in solid dosage forms as a dissolution and a solubility enhancer. We discovered that Soluplus (R) can be dissolved in vitamin E. The result is a tacky and highly adhesive material. Our research objective was to evaluate the rheological, adhesive, and textural properties of the Soluplus (R)/Vitamin E composites. In this study, Soluplus (R) was dissolved under heat in vitamin E at increasing concentrations from 0 to 40% (by weight). The flow behavior of the Soluplus (R)/Vitamin E composites was determined by applying shear stress using an advanced AR2000 rheometer. Under the linear viscoelastic region (LVR), the rheological properties of the blends such as dynamic viscosity (eta'), storage modulus (G'), loss modulus (G ''), and the phase angle tangent (tan delta) were measured. Hardness, adhesiveness, and cohesiveness of the blends were also measured with a TA.XT plus texture analyzer. Rheological analysis showed that the viscosity of the Soluplus (R)/Vitamin E composites increased with an increase in Soluplus (R) concentration but decreased as the temperature increased from 20 to 90 degrees C. The adhesiveness of the blends also significantly increased with an increase in Soluplus (R) concentration. The results from this study indicated that Soluplus (R)/Vitamin E composites have the potential to be exploited in applications where the use of highly adhesive material is desirable.

AB We present the absorption improvement mechanism of fenofibrate (FFB), a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class II drug, from self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SMEDDS), centered on improving the diffusion of FFB through the unstirred water layer (UWL). Four SMEDDS formulations containing Labrafac (TM) lipophile WL 1349 (WL1349) or Labrafil (R) M 1944CS (M1944) oils and NIKKOL HCO-40 (HCO40) or NIKKOL HCO-60 (HCO60) surfactants were prepared. Every SMEDDS formulation formed microemulsion droplets of approximately 30 nm. In vitro tests showed that the microemulsion droplets containing M1944 had relatively small FFB solubilization capacities, causing larger amounts of FFB to be dissolved in the bulk water phase, compared to the droplets containing WL1349. The diffusivity of the microemulsion droplets through the mucin solution layer was enhanced when using HCO40 compared to HCO60. The oral absorption in rats was the highest when using the SMEDDS formulation containing M1944 and HCO40. High FFB distribution in the bulk water phase and fast diffusion of microemulsion droplets through the mucus layer contributed to the efficient delivery of FFB molecules through the UWL to the epithelial cells, leading to enhanced FFB absorption.

AB Polymer microparticles are widely used as acellular drug delivery platforms in regenerative medicine, and have emerging potential as cellular scaffolds for therapeutic cell delivery. In the clinic, PLGA microparticles are typically administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously, with the clinician and clinical application site determining the precise needle gauge used for delivery. Here, we explored the role of needle diameter in microparticle delivery yield, and develop a modified viscosity formulation to improve microparticle delivery across a range of clinically relevant needle diameters. We have identified an optimal biocompatible formulation containing 0.25% pluronic F127 and 0.25% carboxymethyl cellulose, which can increase delivery payload to 520% across needle gauges 21-30G, and note that needle diameter impacts delivery efficacy. We use this formulation to increase the delivery yield of PLGA microparticles, and separately, PLGA-cell scaffolds supporting viable mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), demonstrating the first in vitro delivery of this cell scaffold system. Together, these results highlight an optimal formulation for the delivery of microparticle and microparticle-cell scaffolds, and illustrate how careful choice of delivery formulation and needle size can dramatically impact delivery payload.

AB Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a crucial role in the occurrence of several diseases including cancers. However, little is known about their role in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, we found that hsa_circ_0075930 expression levels were significantly higher in NSCLC cell lines and tissues. The elevated hsa_circ_0075930 expression was correlated with tumor size (P = 0.001) and Lymph node metastasis (P = 0.038). Functional experiments showed knockdown of hsa_circ_0075930 followed by RNA silencing restrained cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest of NSCLC cells. In addition, hsa_circ_0075930 suppression impaired migration and invasion potential by reversing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These results indicated that hsa_circ_0075930 upregulation may be a critical oncogene and potential new biomarker in NSCLC.

AB MYB is a transcription factor which was identified in birds as a viral oncogene (v-MYB). Its cellular counterpart was subsequently isolated as c-MYB which has three functional domains - DNA binding domain, transactivation domain and negative regulatory domain. c-MYB is essential for survival, and deletion of both alleles of the gene results in embryonic death. It is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells, thymus and neural tissue, and required for T and B lymphocyte development and erythroid maturation. Additionally, aberrant MYB expression has been found in numerous solid cancer cells and human leukemia. Recent studies have also implicated c-MYB in the regulation of expression of fetal hemoglobin which is highly beneficial to the beta-hemoglobinopathies (beta thalassemia and sickle cell disease). These findings suggest that MYB could be a potential therapeutic target in leukemia, and possibly also a target for therapeutic increase of fetal hemoglobin in the beta-hemoglobinopathies.

AB The interferon-g-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) plays a significant character in the processing and presentation of MHC class II restricted antigen (Ag) by catalyzing disulfide bond reduction in mammals. To explore the function of GILT in the immune system of fish, we cloned a GILT gene homologue from Trachinotus ovatus, the full-length cDNA of GILT, which consisted of 2, 747 bp with a 771 bp open reading frame, encoding a protein of 256 amino acids. Moreover, similar to other species GILT gene, 7 exons and 6 introns were identified in T. ovatus, the deduced protein also possessed a representative characteristic of known GILT proteins. The result of real-time quantitative PCR showed that GILT mRNA was dramatically expressed in immune-associated tissues, such as spleen (p < 0.01) and kidney (p < 0.05). Bacterial challenge revealed that GILT mRNA level remarkably up-regulation in liver, spleen, kidney and intestine after induction with Photobacterium damsela. Furthermore, based on cloned sequences and genome BLAST, only one SNP site (ToGILT-S1-g.148C > G) was identified, and the allele C was significantly associated with high-susceptibility (HS) group, nevertheless, the allele G was dramatically associated with high-resistance (HR) group, indicating potential application for disease resistant breeding selection in T. ovatus.

AB Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly cancer in male worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of PCa remain unclear. MiR-29c was reported to be down-regulated in several kinds of tumors. Here, we for the first time demonstrated miR-29c was down-regulated in PCa samples. SLC2A3, a regulator of glycolysis, was validated as a direct target of miR-29c. Moreover, functional studies showed miR-29c could inhibit cell growth, induce apoptosis and deceased the rate of glucose metabolism. Accordingly, we identified miR-29c acted as a tumor-suppressor and was down-regulated in PCa. We thought this study will provide useful information to explore the potential candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis targets of PCa.

AB Aim: To explore the association of CCL3 (rs1063340) and CCL4 (rs1049807) polymorphisms with hepatitis C virus (HCV) clearance and sustained virologic response (SVR).
   Methods: Two populations were enrolled in the current study; one was a general population including 1585 untreated individuals, with HCV infection and the other was a treatment population comprising 353 HCV-infected patients treated with pegylated interferon-a and ribavirin (pegIFN-alpha/RBV). Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped, and the relationship between HCV clearance and treatment outcome was analysed.
   Results: The general population comprised 995 persistent HCV cases (both HCV RNA and anti-HCV were positive) and 590 spontaneous clearance cases (HCV RNA was negative, but anti-HCV was positive). An association between the SNPs and HCV clearance was not found in our study. The treatment population consisted of 235 patients who achieved SVR and 118 non-responders. Variants of both SNPs (rs1063340-C and rs1049807-G) were associated with a reduction in SVR following IFN treatment (dominant model: P = 0.026 for rs1063340 and P = 0.048 for rs1049807). In addition, the ancestral alleles of rs1063340 and rs1049807 increased the likelihood of virus clearance by 62% compared to both the derived and minor alleles of the two SNPs (P = 0.040).The interaction analysis showed that the level of glucose interacted with the association of rs1063340 and SVR.
   Conclusions: Our results suggested that genetic variants at the CCL3 and CCL4 loci may be marker SNPs for risk of HCV treatment outcome.

AB In the absence of the RNA-templated reverse transcriptase, telomerase, the predominant means of terminal addition, arises from break-induced replication (BIR) at multiple homologous subtelomeric Y' loci and among internal homeologous (imperfect) (polyG1-3T) tracts. These last tracts are interspersed between subtelomeric Y' direct repeats. One major survivor class contains very short (similar to 50 bp) terminal telomere repeats. This size is sufficient for slow growth and partial telomere functionality and cell viability. However, in cells carrying the mre11A470T allele, adjacent to the predicted Rad50/Mre11 junction, cells thrive at wild-type rates, with small, but reproducible, increases in telomere length. We have proposed that the increase in telomere size and growth rate are causally linked. To understand the BIR process at the telomere, we initiated studies of large-tract (RAD51-sensitive) homologous BIR in MRE11 and mre11A470T cells in a model color assay coupled with CHEF gel analysis and marker retention. Wild-type and mutant homologous BIR rates are maintained at the same level as the rates between wild-type and mutant homeologous BIR. However, the fidelity of BIR products was severely altered in mre11A470T cells. We find that 95% of homologous BIR in MRE11 cells gives rise to the expected product size, while 25% of BIR products in mre11A470T cells were of unpredicted size (error-prone), most of which initiated at an aberrant site. However, similar to 25% of homeologous MRE11 cells and 1/7 of homeologous mre11A470T cells underwent error-prone BIR. This class is initiated erroneously, followed by secondary events that elongate or truncate the telomere. We conclude that error-prone BIRs are increased in homeologous recombination in wild-type and in mre11A470T cells. This finding may explain the bypass of senescence in telomerase-negative cells.

AB Background: Lung cancer leads to the largest number of cancer-related deaths worldwide and is usually accompanied with metastasis which is the primary cause of those death and correlated with poor prognosis. However, the mechanism of lung cancer metastasis is still lack of definition.
   Methods: We compared the primary lung adenocarcinoma (AD) and its metastasis tissues induced by overexpression of Kras(G12D) and inactivation of P53 in mouse lungs by analyzing GSE40222 about the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), pathways and hub genes. And human lung AD databases are used to verify the conversed changes of identified key gene and then followed functional studies are performed to explore the functions of key gene.
   Results: We identified 165 genes differentially expressed in lung AD metastasis compared to primary AD. Pathway analysis identified 649 GO biological processes and 8 KEGG pathways, such as ECM-receptor interaction. Biological network interaction identified the hub genes during lung adenocarcinoma metastasis, such as the up-regulated COL5A1, a novel gene in AD metastasis. We found it's also increased in human AD and advanced stage. Knockdown of COL5A1 in human AD metastatic cells inhibited cell growth and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis. Notably, higher expression of COL5A1 was observed in the lung AD patients with recurrence and short survive.
   Conclusion: By analyzing mouse lung AD and its metastases, we identified the potential key genes and pathways regulating lung AD metastasis, such as COL5A1. The following analysis of COL5A1 in human AD database and cells explores its functions, holding the implications of target therapy in AD metastasis and also providing more clues for future studies.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most lethal and prevalent cancers worldwide and has recently become the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in men of developing countries. Guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) has been reported to be associated with the early process of HCC. In our previous study, GNAO1, one of members of G protein, was found to be down-regulated in HCC. Thus, the present study aimed to throw light upon the mechanism of the abnormal expression of GNAO1 in HCC. First, qPCR results from two HCC cell lines (SMMC-7721 and QGY-7703) confirmed the down-expression of GNAO1, followed by the validation of the methylation status of the promoter region by bisulfite sequence PCR (BSP). Moreover, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (DAC) with Trichostatin A (TSA) treatment made it much clear that GNAO1 transcription was inhibited by promoter hypermethylation, contributing to its low expression. It was further revealed that the silencing effect was regulated by methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), and was further enhanced by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta). In addition, the up-regulation of GNAO1 with the help of recombinant plasmid was also found to accelerate cell apoptosis, confirmed by flow cytometry and western blotting analysis. All these results above indicated that the promoter hypermethylation of GNAO1 might play an important role in HCC, suggesting that it might be used as a promising biomarker for HCC diagnosis and targeted therapy.

AB Aldose reductase (AR) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the polyol pathway and is also the key enzyme involved in diabetic complications. The silkworm purple quail-like mutant (q-l(p)) exhibits pigmented dots on its epidermis. The q-l(p) mutant also shows developmental abnormalities and decreased vitality. In this study, fat bodies from the q-l(p) mutant and the wildtype 932VR strain were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis, and the Bombyx mori AR (BmAR) protein was found to be significantly downregulated in the q-l(p) mutant. The expression of BmAR at the mRNA level was also significantly downregulated, as verified through quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT PCR). Knockdown of the expression of BmAR via RNAi resulted in a reduction of silkworm weight. The sorbitol level in q-l(p) was significantly lower than in the wildtype. These results suggested that the B,nAR gene is closely related to the development of the q-l(p) mutant. Investigation of the cause of BmAR downregulation in the q-l(p) mutant could contribute to revealing the function of AR in insects and offers a new method of identifying AR inhibitors for the treatment of diabetic complications.

AB Systemic chemotherapy as a routine method for the treatment of cancers has several complications. Localized chemotherapy can significantly increase the treatment efficacy and reduce side effects. Here, mesenchymal stem cells derived microvesicles (MVs) was incorporated into Polycaprolactone nanofibers and then the apoptotic behavior of MCF-7 breast cancer cells was investigated while cultured on MVs-Polycaprolactone by using SEM, MIT and apoptotic gene expression. Results demonstrated that MVs-Polycaprolactone group was shown a great apoptosis induction potential into MCF-7 cells and it can be concluded that MVs-Polycaprolactone has a great promising potential to introduce as an in-situ tumor inhibitor construct rather than chemo-drugs.

In this study, we found XIST expression level was upregulated in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. In addition, the growth rate of cells transfected with si-XIST was significantly decreased compared to that with si-NC, which was reversed by miR-34a targeted with 3'-UTR. Moreover, miR-34a suppressed the expression of WNT1 by binding with the 3'-UTR, which interact with WNT1 to inhibit the proliferation of cells. Furthermore, miR-34a inhibitor rescued the dysregulation of WNT1, beta-catenin, cyclinD1, c-Myc and MMP-7 by si-XIST. Besides, XIST knockdown inhibited tumor growth in vivo. In short, the current study suggests XIST plays as an important role in colon cancer progression targeted by miR-34a via Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, providing a novel insight for the pathogenesis and underlying therapeutic target for colon cancer.

AB Ofunato Bay, in Japan, is the home of buoy-and-rope-type oyster aquaculture activities. Since the oysters filter suspended materials and excrete organic matters into the seawater, bacterial communities residing in its vicinity may show dynamic changes depending on the oyster culture activities. We employed a shotgun metagenomic technique to study bacterial communities near oyster aquaculture facilities at the center of the bay (KSt. 2) and compared the results with those of two other localities far from the station, one to the northeast (innermost bay, KSt. 1) and the other to the southwest (bay entrance, KSt. 3). Seawater samples were collected every month from January to December 2015 from the surface (1 m) and deeper (8 or 10 m) layers of the three locations, and the sequentially filtered fraction on 0.2-mu m membranes was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq system. The acquired reads were uploaded to MG-RAST for KEGG functional abundance analysis, while taxonomic analyses at the phylum and genus levels were performed using MEGAN after parsing the BLAST output. Discrimination analyses were then performed using the ROC-AUC value of the cross validation, targeting the depth (shallow or deep), locality [(KSt. 1 + KSt. 2) vs. KSt 3; (KSt. 1 + KSt. 3) vs. KSt. 2 or the (KSt. 2 + KSt. 3) vs. KSt. 1] and seasonality (12 months). The matrix discrimination analysis on the adjacent 2 continuous seasons by ROC-AUC, which was based on the datasets that originated from different depths, localities and months, showed the strongest discrimination signal on the taxonomy matrix at the phylum level for the datasets from July to August compared with those from September to June, while the KEGG matrix showed the strongest signal for the datasets from March to June compared with those from July to February. Then, the locality combination was subjected to the same ROC-AUC discrimination analysis, resulting in significant differences between KSt. 2 and KSt. 1 + KSt. 3 on the KEGG matrix. These results suggest that aquaculture activities markedly affect bacterial functions.

AB Plants maintain extensive growth flexibility under different environmental conditions, allowing them to continuously and rapidly adapt to alterations in their environment. A large portion of many plant genomes consists of transposable elements (TEs) that create new genetic variations within plant species. Different types of mutations may be created by TEs in plants. Many TEs can avoid the host's defense mechanisms and survive alterations in transposition activity, internal sequence and target site. Thus, plant genomes are expected to utilize a variety of mechanisms to tolerate TEs that are near or within genes. TEs affect the expression of not only nearby genes but also unlinked inserted genes. TEs can create new promoters, leading to novel expression patterns or alternative coding regions to generate alternate transcripts in plant species. TEs can also provide novel cis-acting regulatory elements that act as enhancers or inserts within original enhancers that are required for transcription. Thus, the regulation of plant gene expression is strongly managed by the insertion of TEs into nearby genes. TEs can also lead to chromatin modifications and thereby affect gene expression in plants. TEs are able to generate new genes and modify existing gene structures by duplicating, mobilizing and recombining gene fragments. They can also facilitate cellular functions by sharing their transposase-coding regions. Hence, TE insertions can not only act as simple mutagens but can also alter the elementary functions of the plant genome. Here, we review recent discoveries concerning the contribution of TEs to gene expression in plant genomes and discuss the different mechanisms by which TEs can affect plant gene expression and reduce host defense mechanisms.

AB Magnesium (Mg) is an essential mineral element for normal plant growth and development, and the CorA/MRS2/MGT-type Mg transporters play a significant role in maintaining Mg homeostasis in plants. In total, 12 maize CorA-like Mg2+ transporters have been identified, but none of them had been functionally characterized. Accordingly, we cloned and functionally characterized ZtnMGT12 from the maize CorA-like gene family. ZmMGT12 exhibited the structure typical of Mg2+ transporters, i.e., two conserved TM domains and a GMN tripeptide motif. ZmMGT12, Arabidopsis AtMGT6, and rice OsMRS2-6 shared high protein sequence identity and thus clustered in the same phylogenetic branch, suggesting that they could be homologs. A functional complementation assay in the Salmonella typhimurium MM281 mutant indicated that ZmMGT12 possessed Mg2+ transport ability. ZmMGT12 was expressed in roots, stems, and leaves, with the highest expression in leaves. Moreover, ZmMGT12 expression was induced by light and exhibited a circadian expression pattern. In addition, the expression level of ZmMGT12 in leaf tissue was related to chlorophyll synthesis. Overexpression of ZmMGT12 in Arabidopsis caused no phenotypic change in transgenic plants, including in fresh shoot weight, chlorophyll content, shoot Mg2+ content, and chloroplast Mg2+ content. Together, these results suggest that ZmMGT12 is a Mg2+ transporter and may play a role in Mg transport into chloroplasts.

AB Ofunato Bay is located in the northeastern Pacific Ocean area of Japan, and it has the highest biodiversity of marine organisms in the world, primarily due to tidal influences from the cold Oyashio and warm Kuroshio Currents. Our previous results from performing shotgun metagenomics indicated that Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique and Planktomarina temperata were the dominant bacteria (Reza et al., 2018a, 2018b). These bacteria are reportedly able to catabolize dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) produced from phytoplankton into dimethyl sulfide (DMS) or methanethiol (MeSH). This study was focused on seasonal changes in the abundances of bacterial genes (dddP, dmdA) related to DMSP catabolism in the seawater of Ofunato Bay by BLAST + analysis using shotgun metagenomic datasets. We found seasonal changes among the Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique strains, including those of the HTCC1062 type and the Red Sea type. A good correlation was observed between the chlorophyll a concentrations and the abundances of the catabolic genes, suggesting that the bacteria directly interact with phytoplankton in the marine material cycle system and play important roles in producing DMS and MeSH from DMSP as signaling molecules for the possible formation of the scent of the tidewater or as fish attractants.

AB The Ofunato Bay in the northeastern Pacific Ocean area of Japan possesses the highest biodiversity of marine organisms in the world and has attracted much attention due to its economic and environmental importance. We report here a shotgun metagenomic analysis of the year-round variation in free-living bacterioplankton collected across the entire length of the bay. Phylogenetic differences among spring, summer, autumn and winter bacterioplankton suggested that members of Proteobacteria tended to decrease at high water temperatures and increase at low temperatures. It was revealed that Candidatus Pelagibacter varied seasonally, reaching as much as 60% of all sequences at the genus level in the surface waters during winter. This increase was more evident in the deeper waters, where they reached up to 75%. The relative abundance of Planktomarina also rose during winter and fell during summer. A significant component of the winter bacterioplankton community was Archaea (mainly represented by Nitrosopumilus), as their relative abundance was very low during spring and summer but high during winter. In contrast, Actinobacteria and Cyanobacteria appeared to be higher in abundance during high-temperature periods. It was also revealed that Bacteroidetes constituted a significant component of the summer bacterioplankton community, being the second largest bacterial phylum detected in the Ofunato Bay. Its members, notably Polaribacter and Flavobacterium, were found to be high in abundance during spring and summer, particularly in the surface waters. Principal component analysis and hierarchal clustering analyses showed that the bacterial communities in the Ofunato Bay changed seasonally, likely caused by the levels of organic matter, which would be deeply mixed with surface runoff in the winter.

AB The Ofunato Bay in Iwate Prefecture, Japan is a deep coastal bay located at the center of the Sanriku Rias Coast and considered an economically and environmentally important asset. Here, we describe the first whole genome sequencing (WGS) study on the microbial community of the bay, where surface water samples were collected from three stations along its length to cover the entire bay; we preliminarily sequenced a 0.2 pm filter fraction among sequentially size-fractionated samples of 20.0, 5.0, 0.8 and 0.2 pm filters, targeting the free-living fraction only. From the 0.27-0.34 Gb WGS library, 0.9 x 10(6)-1.2 x 10(6) reads from three sampling stations revealed 29 bacterial phyla (similar to 80% of assigned reads), 3 archaeal phyla (similar to 4%) and 59 eukaryotic phyla (similar to 15%). Microbial diversity obtained from the WGS approach was compared with 16S rRNA gene results by mining WGS metagenomes, and we found similar estimates. The most frequently recovered bacterial sequences were Proteobacteria, predominantly comprised of 18.0-19.6% Planktomarina (Family Rhodobacteraceae) and 13.7-17.5% Candidatus Pelagibacter (Family Pelagibacterales). Other dominant bacterial genera, including Polaribacter (3.5-6.1%), Flavobacterium (1.8-2.6%), Sphingobacterium (1.4-1.6%) and Cellulophaga (1.4-2.0%), were members of Bacteroidetes and likely associated with the degradation and turnover of organic matter. The Marine Group I Archaea Nitrosopumilus was also detected. Remarkably, eukaryotic green alga Bathycoccus, Ostreococcus and Micromonas accounted for 8.8 15.2%, 3.6 4.9% and 2.1-3.1% of total read counts, respectively, highlighting their potential roles in the phytoplankton bloom after winter mixing.

AB This study firstly used a rat traumatic brain injury model to compare the therapeutic effects of different intravenous infusion speed of 7.5% hypertonic saline (HS). Then the authors applied different delivery rate of 7.5% HS to two groups of patients to figure out the optimal infusion rates. A total of 100 rats were randomly divided into control group, group A (7.5% HS 6 mL/h), group B (7.5% HS 3 mL/h), and group C (7.5% HS 2 mL/h). All rats were established for the brain injury model. A total of 30 patients were selected and randomly divided into group A (250 mL/h) and group B (125 mL/h), with 15 cases in each group. Urine amount was recorded per hour; furthermore, blood was extracted from the patients to measure the levels of AQP4, NKCC1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Compared with other groups, the expression levels of NKCC1 and AQP4 mRNA in group A was the lowest (P < 0.05). NKCC1 and AQP4 protein expression levels were the lowest in all the groups (P < 0.05). On the aspect of patients, group A displayed more significant difference compared with B group in terms of AQP4, NKCC1, TNF-a, 1L 1 beta, and IL-6 (P < 0.05). In the two groups, a significant difference was noted in the urine amount at 4 h after administration (P < 0.05). In our study, infusion of hypertonic saline (250 mL/h) at the optimal rate of 7.5% HS decreased the intracranial pressure, brain tissue edema, and inflammatory cytokine expression; moreover, it can promote brain tissue protection.

AB To prevent the postharvest disease of Chinese cabbage and lettuce, hexanal was used as a control measure to inhibit N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) production and extracellular enzymes regulated by quorum-sensing (QS) in their main spoilage strains of Erwinia carotovora and Pseudomonas fluorescens. Firstly, the QS inhibition of hexanal was verified by significantly inhibiting violacein production (p < 0.05) in Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 at sub-MICs. beta-Galactosidase activities which reflected AHL production, were significantly inhibited by hexanal, its inhibitory effect was concentration-dependent under minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) (p < 0.05). The detected extracellular enzymes activities decreased with the increase of hexanal concentration (p < 0.05), including cellulase, xylanase, pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, and protease. Chinese cabbage soft rot and lettuce leaf scorch could be significantly inhibited by hexanal (p < 0.05) without any phytotoxicity effect, the 1/2 MIC of hexanal showed the best inhibitory effect. And all the above effects showed a dose-dependent. A novel preservation technique in reducing the loss of vegetables due to spoilage based on the QS inhibitor was developed.

AB This study aimed to investigate the interactions between insoluble fractions of different coffee infusions and major cocoa free antioxidants, catechin and epicatechin, as well as the interactions between different coffee infusions and dark chocolate. Espresso, filtered coffee, French press and Turkish coffee were used for this purpose. Antioxidant capacity (AC) measurements were performed by monitoring the percentage inhibition of 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil (DPPH) radical. Multivariate approach was adopted for experimental design and data analysis steps. In dry basis, the AC values of infusions (mmol Trolox/kg) were ranged between 953 +/- 2.6 and 1184 +/- 11.3, while the AC values for their insoluble fractions were ranged between 45 +/- 0.0 and 105-1.3. Interactions between the insoluble fractions of coffee infusions and catechins were synergistic for espresso and additive/antagonistic for the other infusions. Interactions between coffee infusions and chocolate were synergistic for French press and Turkish coffee and additive/antagonistic for the other infusions.

AB Since polyphenols are known to exhibit antioxidative properties, we prepared and characterized persimmon vinegar polyphenols (PVP) in this study. Furthermore, we investigated the protective effect of PVP on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress in HepG2 cells and its underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that flavon-3-ols were the predominant polyphenols in PVP. Pre-treatment with PVP significantly decreased (p < 0.05) H2O2-induced cell damage in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by decrease in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, aminotransferase activities, and ROS accumulation. Moreover, PVP upregulated the expression of antioxidative enzymes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and increased the levels of glutathione. Western blotting results showed that PVP induced the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived-2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Taken together, our results indicated that PVP effectively protected HepG2 cells against oxidative stress via activation of the Nrf2 antioxidative pathway.

AB The study developed a new method for proline detection in honey, wine and fruit juice using ultrasound assisted-cloud point extraction (UA-CPE) and spectrophotometry. Initially, a quaternary complex was built, containing proline, histamine, Cu(II), and fluorescein at pH 5.5. Samples were treated with ethanol-water mixture before extraction and preconcentration, using an ultrasonic bath for 10min at 40 degrees C (40 kHz, 300W). After the optimization of variables affecting extraction efficiency, good linearity was obtained between 15 and 600 mu g L-1 with sensitivity enhancement factor of 105. The limits of detection and quantification were 5.7 and 19.0 mu g L-,(-1) respectively. The recovery percentage and relative standard deviations (RSD%) were between 95.3 and 103.3%, and 2.5 and 4.2%, respectively. The accuracy of the method was verified by the analysis of a standard reference material (SRM 2389a).

AB The effects of the concentration of watermelon juice at different temperatures (45, 55, or 65 degrees C) on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics, antioxidant capacity, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of whey-based popsicles were investigated. Total phenolic content, lycopene, citrulline, VOCs, melting rate, instrumental colour, antioxidant capacity, and the sensory characteristics (hedonic test and free listing) were determined. The temperature led to a significant decrease in bioactive compounds (total phenolics, lycopene, and citrulline). The popsicle manufactured with reconstituted watermelon juice concentrated to 60 degrees Brix at 65 degrees C presented higher antioxidant capacity and was characterized by the presence of alcohols, aldehydes and ketones and presented a similar acceptance to the untreated popsicle (except for flavour). It is possible to combine whey and concentrated watermelon juice for the manufacture of bioactive-rich popsicles, using the concentration temperature of 65 degrees C as a suitable processing condition for potential industrial applications.

AB Pure stevioside was extracted from leaves of Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni) to be used as a reference material in the instrument calibration or method validation process. The mass fraction was determined by comparison between the mass balance method and quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR) spectroscopy. The impurities in the sample were analyzed by Karl Fischer titration for moisture content and thermogravimetric analysis for inorganic residue. Homogeneity, together with short term and long term stability, were also studied and the uncertainty was reported. The certified value of this mass fraction is 0.986 +/- 0.0019 (k = 2) with 1 year stability.

AB A magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer (MMIP) adsorbent for imidacloprid was prepared using non-covalent approach with functionalized nano Fe3O4 particles (magnetic cores), imidacloprid (template), acrylic acid (functional monomer), ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (cross linker) and azobisisobutyronitrile (initiator) and used for selective separation of imidacloprid from honey and vegetable samples. The polymers were characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM and TEM images. For analysis of imidacloprid LC-MS/MS equipment was used. Adsorption kinetics was best explained by pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Adsorption data fitted well into linearized Freundlich equation (R-2 > 0.98). Scatchard plot analysis indicates the presence of two classes of binding sites in the MMIPs with the C-max of 1889.6 mu g g(-1) and 65448.9 mu g g(-1), respectively. MMIPs demonstrated much higher affinity for imidacloprid over structurally similar analogues acetamiprid (alpha = 23.59) and thiamethoxam (alpha = 17.15). About 87.1 +/- 5.0% and 90.6 +/- 5.6% of the added imidacloprid was recovered from MMIPs in case of fortified eggplant and honey samples, respectively.

AB An account of antioxidant and antimicrobial characteristics displayed by ethyl acetate extract of Talaromyces purpureogenus CFRM-02 cultivated by submerged fermentation on bengal gram husk (BegH) led to the isolation of a new molecule, which was purified via silica gel column chromatography. The TLC and HPLC data revealed the purity of the isolated compound. By employing an array of spectroscopic techniques, structural elucidation was accomplished, and the molecule was identified as 2-hydroxymethyl-benzoic acid 2'-hydroxy-tetradecyl ester and was also designated with a familiar name pentalsamonin. The pentalsamonin molecule scavenged DPPH (24%), H2O2 (64%), superoxide anion (58%) with a reducing power (0.989 AU) at the given concentration. The MIC and MBC of pentalsamonin against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are in the range 62.5-125 and 125-250 mu g/ml, respectively. The antioxidant and antibacterial functional attributes of pentalsamonin suggest useful applications in food and nutraceuticals.

AB A multi-methodological approach was applied to study red sweet peppers (Capsicum annuum L.) ecotype "Cornetto di Pontecorvo" grown in a greenhouse or in open field. This approach includes morphological analysis, chemical composition determination, and biological activity evaluation of different extracts from pepper fruits. Untargeted analyses, namely NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, allowed the comprehensive pepper metabolite profile of pepper pulp, peel and seeds hydroalcoholic and organic extracts to be determined, showing the presence of sugars, organic acids, amino acids and other secondary metabolites. Targeted analyses, such as HPLC-PDA, HPLC-TLC and spectrophotometric analyses allowed polyphenols, tannins, flavonoids and pigments content to be determined. Samples quality and freshness were verified by the low content of biogenic amines and mycotoxins, as determined using HPLC-FLD and HPLC-MS, respectively. Preliminary biological results demonstrated the ability of the organic extracts to inhibit alpha-amylase, a key enzyme in the control of glucose metabolism.

AB Chemical analyses and sensory evaluation are the most applied methods for quality control of roasted and ground coffee (RG). However, faster alternatives would be highly valuable. Here, we applied infrared-photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) on RG powder. Mixtures of specific defective beans were blended with healthy (defect-free) Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora bases in specific ratios, forming different classes of blends. Principal Component Analysis allowed predicting the amount/fraction and nature of the defects in blends while partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis revealed similarities between blends (= samples). A successful predictive model was obtained using six classes of blends. The model could classify 100% of the samples into four classes. The specificities were higher than 0.9. Application of FTIR-PAS on RG coffee to characterize and classify blends has shown to be an accurate, easy, quick and "green" alternative to current methods.

AB This study summarizes the results obtained from a systematic and long-term project aimed at the development of tools to assess the provenance of food in the oenological sector. In particular, Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios were measured on statistically representative set of soils, vine branches and wines sampled in the production district of Modena, worldwide known for the Lambrusco wines production. The obtained data were used to build strontium isotopic maps able to objectively support the Lambrusco PDO wines origin as well as other products of the Modena district.
   Finally, a strong relationship was found between the Sr-87/Sr-86 isotope ratios of soils and vine branches on a large scale, highlighting and confirming once more the idea that plants can also represent an optimal sampling device to support geographical traceability.

AB The functional chemical substances and the antioxidant activity of lipids in 21 marine algae along the Japanese coast were investigated. Principal component analysis was performed to detect any correlation between the chemical substances and algae phylum. Chlorophyta contained a high level of beta-carotene. Rhodophyta contained high amounts of cholesterol, beta-sitosterol, and saturated fatty acids. Phaeophyta were rich in fucosterol, alpha-tocopherol, fucoxanthin, and polyphenol. Phaeophyta algae also showed the highest antioxidant activity compared with other phylum. This suggests that Phaeophyta has the greatest potential to be used as a functional food. Consumption of the beneficial Phaeophyta species, such as Eisenia arborea Areschoug and Ecklonia cava Kjellman should be encouraged as not only as food products but also as nutraceuticals and dietary supplements. These beneficial ingredients should be encouraged to be studied in depth with the possibility to develop specific formulated products target to special consumer's population with added nutritional value.

AB Quinces are attracting interest due to their health and nutritional benefits. Drying kinetics, bioactive compounds, antioxidant activity, and the main sensory parameters were determined in dried quinces, cultivar Leskovac, as affected by the drying method. The highest total polyphenols content was observed in dried samples obtained after freeze drying and convective drying at 50 degrees C. The best drying treatment, considering only sensory attributes, was vacuum-microwave drying at 480 W, because it led to intermediate dark color and high intensities of basic tastes and key flavor attributes. The studied parameters were finally used to recommend convective drying at 60 degrees C as the most appropriate drying method for quinces, because it had a high content of total phenolic compounds (2nd best treatment out of 10), a good sensory profile, was cheap, and caused no negative effects on nutritional or sensory parameters; the only disadvantage was its long drying time.

AB Dramatic increase in NaCl consumption lead to sodium intake beyond health guidelines. KCl substitution helps reduce sodium intake but results in a bitter-metallic off-taste. Two disaccharides, trehalose and sucrose, were tested in order to untangle the chemical (increase in effective concentration of KCl due to sugar addition) from the sensory effects. The bitter-metallic taste of KCl was reduced by these sugars, while saltiness was enhanced or unaltered. The perceived sweetness of sugar, regardless of its type and concentration, was an important factor in KCl taste modulation. Though KCl was previously shown to increase the chemical activity of trehalose but not of sucrose, we found that it suppressed the perceived sweetness of both sugars. Therefore, sensory integration was the dominant factor in the tested KCl-sugar combinations.

AB The present paper describes the validation of a spectrophotometry method involving molecular absorption in the visible ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) region for selenium (Se) determination in the bacterial biomass produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The method was found to be suitable for the target application and presented a linearity range from 0.025 to 0.250 mg/L Se. The angular and linear coefficients of the linear equation were 1.0678 and 0.0197 mg/L Se, respectively, and the linear correlation coefficient (R-2) was 0.9991. Analyte recovery exceeded 96% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) below 3%. The Se contents in LAB ranged from 0.01 to 20 mg/g. The Se contents in the bacterial biomass determined by UV-Vis were not significantly different (p > 0.05) those determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Thus, Se can be quantified in LAB biomass using this relatively simpler technique.

AB Sensory evaluation of roasted cocoa not only revealed cocoa-specific but also more or less pronounced nutty-specific aroma notes. Essential precursors of the corresponding volatile compounds could be generated in vitro by proteolysis of the cocoa vicilin-class(7S) globulin using a mixture of cocoa aspartic protease and cocoa carboxypeptidase. Since both proteases have rather different pH optima (pH 3.5 and 5.5-6.0, respectively), we have investigated the pH-dependency of proteolysis of this protein substrate in the presence of both proteases, the liberation of free amino acids and the generated aroma potential. Our findings revealed that the precursors of the nutty aroma notes were generated at higher pH-values (pH 4.8-5.6) than the cocoa-specific precursor peptides (pH 4.4-5.2). Longer peptide fragments of the cocoa vicilin were formed by proteolysis at pH 5.2 than at pH 4.8. Furthermore, our findings indicated that cocoa-vicilin derived peptides are essential precursors of both the cocoa-and the nutty-specific aroma components.

AB Alkylmethoxypyrazines are powerful odorants in many food products. A new method for analysing 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine, 3-s-butyl-2-methoxypyrazine and 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine has been developed and applied to wine. The analytes were extracted from 5 mL of wine using stirbar sorptive extraction followed by thermal desorption and multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis in a single oven. The extraction conditions were optimized in order to obtain a high recovery of the 3-alkyl-2-methoxypyrazines (MP). The detection limits of the method in all cases were under 0.08 ng/L, well below the olfactory thresholds of these compounds in wine. The reproducibility of the method was adequate (below 10%), the linearity satisfactory and the recoveries in all cases close to 100%. The method has been applied to the analysis of 111 Spanish and French wine samples. The levels found suggest that MP have a low direct impact on the aroma properties of wines from the regions around the Pyrenean massif.

AB Transitory allergies to cow milk proteins in infants or adults have become a public health problem. Although extensively or partially hydrolyzed cow milk protein formulas are available, these products are costly. Therefore, studies into innovative enzymes to digest cow milk proteins are needed. Danaus plexippus gut peptidases were purified and examined with regard to cow milk protein hydrolysis. The peptidases hydrolyzed caseins and whey proteins. However, after heat treatment, there was a significant improvement in beta-lactoglobulin hydrolysis. The hydrolyzed cow milk proteins were not recognized by anti-casein antibodies and only reacted slightly with antibodies against whey proteins. This performance was better than that of partially hydrolyzed formulas and similar to that of an extensively hydrolyzed formula. These results suggest that D. plexippus gut peptidases are suitable and innovative enzymes to produce hypoallergenic cow milk protein formulas.

AB Previous studies of galangal (Alpinia galanga) have focussed mostly on rhizomes but seldom on flowers. A comprehensive look at galangal flowers could reveal additional benefits. The chemical composition of galangal flowers was significantly (p < 0.05) different from that of galangal rhizome. Pentadecane and alpha-humulene were identified as major compounds of galangal flower essential oil. 1'-acetoxyeugenol acetate was identified as the highest compound in flowers and exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity among all fractions, with MIC50 values of 34 mu g/ml against Staphylococcus aureus and 68 mu g/ml against Listeria monocytogenes. Galangal flowers had a 3-fold higher total phenols content than had rhizomes (10.5 vs. 3.33 mg GAE/g powder). The antioxidant activities of different flower fractions varied from 2 to 4.45 mmol trolox/g phenolics. These findings suggest that antimicrobial and antioxidant agents extracted from galangal flowers could potentially be utilized as natural food preservatives or as therapeutic agents.

AB An unprecedented characterization of free fatty acids (FFA) in the lipid extracts of fresh or thermally treated mussels of sp. Mytilus galloprovincialis, including up to 128 saturated, mono- or poly-unsaturated and 63 oxidized (i.e., modified by hydroxylic, carbonylic and/or epoxylic groups) compounds, was achieved using reverse phase chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization-Fourier transform single and tandem mass spectrometry (RPC-ESI-FTMS, MS/MS). Subsequent Principal Components Analysis (PCA) evidenced several effects of thermal treatments on the mussel FFA profiles. In particular, death-inducing low temperature treatments (freezing at -16 degrees C or refrigeration at 4 degrees C for several days) induced a peculiar increase in the incidence of FFA, whereas the effect was absent in mussels undergoing death upon prolonged storage at room temperature (25 degrees C, 6 h) or fast cooking (100 degrees C, 5 min). Alive mussels, either fresh or resulting from short term (up to 48 h) refrigeration were actually indistinguishable by PCA, although subtle seasonal effects were observed.

AB The investigation of volatile compounds in the headspace of liquid samples can often be used for detailed and non-destructive characterisation of the sample. This has great potential for process control or the characterisation of food samples, such as olive oil. We investigated, for the first time, the plume of substances released from olive oil droplets by laser desorption in a feasibility study and applied ion mobility spectrometry coupled to rapid GC pre-separation to enhance selectivity. Our investigation demonstrated that significantly more substances can be detected and quantified via laser desorption than in the usual headspace, enabling a rapid (5-10 min), sensitive (low ng/g range) and comprehensive analysis of the sample, with the potential for quality control and fraud identification. Therefore, laser desorption provides a useful sampling tool for characterising liquids in many applications, requiring only a few mu L of sample.

AB Lacy phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Borkh.) honey composition was screened by UHPLC-DAD-QqTOF-MS. The targeted analysis revealed 6 major nitrogen compounds including aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine), purine derivatives (adenine, xanthine), nucleoside (uridine) and rare non-cyanogenic cyanoglucoside, (-)-5-epi-lithospermoside ((2Z)-2-[(4R, 5R, 6S)-4,5-dihydroxy-6-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl) oxycyclohex-2-en-1-yli-dene] acetonitrile). Their identity was confirmed by different analytical tools: HRMS, co-chromatography with standard compound or comprehensive NMR experiments. All the compounds, except amino acids, were reported and determined in honey for the first time. The amount of the compounds was quantified in 16 unifloral phacelia samples: adenine (18.45 +/- 4.63 mg/kg), xanthine (10.53 +/- 2.98 mg/kg), uridine (42.84 +/- 9.26 mg/kg), tyrosine (14.66 +/- 10.22 mg/kg), (-)-5-epi-lithospermoside (70.61 +/- 31.37 mg/kg) and phenylalanine (20.41 +/- 11.99 mg/kg). The (-)-5-epi-lithospermoside content is significantly correlated with P. tanacetifolia pollen percentage (R-2 = 0.5612, p < 0.001) and it is proposed as a potential marker of botanical origin for phacelia honey.

AB A method for arsenic speciation in shark, shrimp, squid, oyster and scallop using liquid chromatography coupled to inductively coupled plasma triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS/MS) was proposed. Suitable sensitivity and selectivity by LC-ICP-MS/MS were obtained using 10 mmol L-1 (NH4)(2)HPO4 diluted in 1% methanol (pH 8.65) as mobile phase. Recoveries from 90 to 104% for arsenobetaine (AsB), arsenite [As(III)], dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and arsenate [As(V)] were obtained for all samples. A certificated reference material was also analyzed and the sum of As species was in agreement with the total As concentration. Limits of quantification (LOQ) for AsB, As(III), DMA, MMA, and As(V) were 6, 30, 6, 12 and 26 ng g(-1), respectively. Higher concentration of AsB was found in all seafood, while As(III) and DMA were found only in oyster. Arsenate was found in squid and scallops, and MMA was below the LOQ in all samples.

AB Spent coffee grounds (SCGs) are viewed as a valuable resource for useful bioactive compounds, such as chlorogenic acids and flavonoids, and we suggest an eco-friendly and efficient valorization method. A series of choline chloride-based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) were tested as green extraction solvents for use with ultrasound-assisted extraction. Extraction efficiency was evaluated based on total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content, total chlorogenic acids, and/or anti-oxidant activity. A binary DES named HC-6, which was composed of 1,6-hexanediol: choline chloride (molar ratio 7:1) was designed to produce the highest efficiency. Experimental conditions were screened and optimized for maximized efficiency using a two-level fractional factorial design and a central composite design, respectively. As a result, the proposed method presented significantly enhanced TPC and anti-oxidant activity. In addition, phenolic compounds could be easily recovered from extracts at high recovery yields (> 90%) by adsorption chromatography.

AB Milk powder is a food for malnourished African children and for healthy infants of women with HIV/AIDS. High demand and low purchasing power has resulted in a huge informal, black market in Sub-Saharan Africa. Forty-three milk powder batches were analyzed for 43 chemical elements using ICP-MS One sample (2.3%) was contaminated at a lead concentration of 240 mu g/kg dry weight exceeding the European threshold (130 mu g/kg dry weight). Macroelement contents revealed a trend decreasing in concentration through skimmed, full cream products to infant formulae. Concentration ranges by dry weight differed in respect of uncertainty intervals of +/- 10%. Median Ca, K and P concentrations declined from 11.14 g/kg to 3.21 g/kg, 14.11 g/kg to 4.95 g/kg and 9.12 g/kg to 2.75 g/kg dry mass, respectively. Milk powder samples obtained from the Tanzanian black market were comparable in respect of nutritional and chemical content to international branded full cream products.

AB In Europe, 2-acetyl-4-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroxybutyl)imidazole (THI) and 4-methylimidazole (4-MEI) are - to a certain level - allowed to be present in the food colours ammonia caramel (E 150c) and sulphite ammonia caramel (E 150d). Besides their presence in food colours, exposure to these contaminants may also include other dietary sources. This study describes the occurrence of THI and 4-MEI in a wide variety of food products (n = 522) purchased from the Belgian market and their dietary intake in Belgian consumers from 15 years old onwards. THI was found to be present in 22.4% of the investigated foods at a level up to 551 mu g/kg. For 4-MEI (57.7% quantifiable), concentrations up to 2,835 mu g/kg were observed. The average dietary intake amounted to 0.02-0.36 mu g kg(-1) bw(-1) day for THI and 0.4-3.7 mu g kg(-1) bw(-1) day for 4-MEI. Coffee, cola and beer were contributing most to the dietary THI and 4-MEI intake in Belgium.

AB ELISA/immunosensor were developed for a sensitive detection of pork adulteration in meat. Two formats of ELISA were performed. First, an extracted IgG was directly immobilized in the microplate. This assay allowed an identification of 0.01% as level of pork adulteration in 14 h15 min. In order to decrease the time of the assay, a competitive ELISA was developed by immobilizing IgG standard, which compete with the extracted IgG. This assay allowed a detection of 0.1% of pork adulteration in 45 min.
   Furthermore, two formats of electrochemical immunosensors were elaborated using the electro-entrapment of IgG in polymer modified graphite paste electrode. First, a direct immunosensor was capable of identifying 0.1 and 1% in raw and cooked meat respectively in 2 h. The second format was based on a competitive immunosensor, which was able to detect 0.01% of pork adulteration within 20 min.
   Both competitive immunoassays revealed high sensitivity, good specify and reduced analysis time.

AB Nerolidol, a naturally occurring sesquiterpene with antimicrobial activities, is a promising candidate as a natural alternative for synthetic preservatives in food. However, its application is limited by low aqueous solubility and stability. In this study, conventional liposomes and drug-in-cyclodextrin-in-liposomes (DCLs) were evaluated for the first time as encapsulating materials for nerolidol. The size, encapsulation efficiency (EE%), loading rate (LR%), photo-and storage stabilities of both systems were characterized. Moreover, the in vitro release of nerolidol from liposomes and DCLs was investigated over time. Nerolidol was efficiently entrapped in both carriers with high EE% and LR% values. In addition, DCLs prolonged the release of nerolidol over one week and enhanced the photostability more effectively than conventional liposomes. Finally, all formulations were stable after 12 months of storage at 4 degrees C (> 60% incorporated nerolidol). Therefore, DCLs are promising carriers for new applications of sesquiterpenes in the pharmaceutical and food industries.

AB Roasting is an important cocoa processing step, but has been reported to reduce the polyphenol content in the beans. We investigated the impact of whole-bean roasting on the polyphenol content, aroma-related chemistry, and in vitro pancreatic lipase (PL) inhibitory activity of cocoa under a range of roasting conditions. Total phenolics, (-)-epicatechin, and proanthocyanidin (PAC) dimer - pentamer content was reduced by roasting. By contrast, roasting at 150 degrees C or greater increased the levels of catechin and PAC hexamers and heptamers. These compounds have greater PL inhibitory potency. Consistent with these changes in PAC composition and this previous data, we found that roasting at 170 degrees C time-dependently increased PL inhibitory activity. Cocoa aromarelated compounds increased with roasting above 100 degrees C, whereas deleterious sensory-related compounds formed at more severe temperatures. Our results indicate that cocoa roasting can be optimized to increase the content of larger PACs and anti-PL activity, while maintaining a favorable aroma profile.

AB CdTe/CdS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) were synthesized in aqueous phase and conjugated with a new anti-zearalenone (ZEN) monoclonal antibody. Using this novel fluorescent probe, a fluoroimmunoassay (FLISA) and a rapid immunochromatographic strip (ICTS) were developed for the detection of ZEN in maize. Our proposed FLISA allowed for ZEN determination in the range of 0.038-0.977 ng/mL with an IC50 of 0.162 ng/mL and a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.012 ng/mL occurring in maize. The rapid ICTS had a visual LOD of 1.0 ng/mL in buffer solution and 1.5 ng/mL in maize extract. These two QDs-based immunoassays were all successfully verified by commercial ELISA kits. The results confirmed that: firstly, the FLISA can be used as a robust method for the sensitive detection of ZEN; and secondly, the ICTS is ideally suited for rapidly screening large numbers of samples.

AB Background: Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) are both licensed for administration to nursing mothers. Little is known about the potential for transmission of LAIV viruses from the mother to the infant and the comparative breast milk antibody responses to LAIV and IIV.
   Methods: We performed a randomized, double-blind study comparing the immunogenicity of LAW to IIV when administered to nursing mothers. The safety of LAIV to IIV in women and their infants was also compared. Women received LAIV + intramuscular placebo, or IIV + intranasal placebo on Day 0. Breast milk and nasal swabs (from women and infants) were collected on Days 0, 2, and 8 for detection of LAIV. Breast milk and serum antibody responses were measured at Days 0 and 28. The primary hypothesis was that LAIV would provide superior induction of breast milk IgA responses to influenza as compared to IIV when administered to nursing mothers.
   Results: Breast milk IgG, breast milk IgA (H1N1 only), serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), and serum IgG responses were significantly higher following administration of IIV compared to LAIV. Receipt of either LAIV or IIV was safe in women and their infants. One (1%) LAIV recipient transmitted vaccine virus to her infant who remained well. No influenza virus was detected in breast milk.
   Conclusions: Breast milk and serum antibody responses were higher for IIV compared to LAIV. LAIV and IIV were safe for nursing women but there was one (1%) possible transmission of LAIV to an infant. This study suggests that IIV may be the preferred vaccine for nursing mothers.

AB Background: Influenza immunization is universally recommended during pregnancy to protect mothers and their offspring. However, pregnancy-induced shifts in vaccine responsiveness remain poorly defined.
   Methods: Quantitative and qualitative shifts in the serological response to influenza vaccination were evaluated in healthy women throughout the course of pregnancy. Serum was obtained before and after vaccination among 71 pregnant and 67 non-pregnant women during the 2011-12 and 2012-13 influenza seasons. Serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay was used to investigate anti-influenza antibody responses by comparing pre-vaccine and post-vaccine geometric mean titers (GMTs) between groups for each antigen. IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4 anti-influenza titers were also evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pregnancy induced shifts in HAI titers and levels of each anti-influenza antibody isotype were evaluated using linear regression models.
   Results: Post-vaccine GMTs at day 28 were significantly reduced for women vaccinated during pregnancy for A/California (H1N1) in 2011 (p = 0.027), A/Perth (H3N2) in 2011 (p = 0.037), and B/Wisconsin in 2012 (p = 0.039). Vaccine responses progressively declined with the initiation of vaccination later in pregnancy. Anti-H1N1 IgGl, IgG2, and IgG3 titers were reduced in pregnant women compared to non-pregnant controls, and these titers declined with pregnancy progression. The most striking differences were found for anti-H1N1 IgG1, where titers decreased by approximately 7% each week throughout pregnancy.
   Conclusions: HAI responses elicited by immunization were significantly reduced during pregnancy for three different influenza vaccine antigens. Anti-H1N1 IgG1 was significantly lower in pregnant women and decreased throughout the course of pregnancy. Waning serological responsiveness to influenza vaccination with the progression of human pregnancy has important translational implications for when immunization should be optimally administered during pregnancy.

AB Background: Evaluations of oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in diverse settings. However, low vaccine uptake in some settings reduces the opportunity for prevention. This paper identifies the socioeconomic factors associated with vaccine uptake in a mass vaccination program.
   Methods: This was a three-arm (vaccine, vaccine plus behavioral change, and non-intervention) cluster randomized trial conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Socio-demographic and vaccination data were collected from 268,896 participants. A geographical information system (GIS) was used to design and implement the vaccination program. A logistic regression model was used to assess the association between vaccine uptake and socioeconomic characteristics.
   Results: The GIS supported the implementation of the vaccination program by identifying ideal locations of vaccination centres for equitable population access, defining catchment areas of daily activities, and providing daily coverage maps during the campaign. Among 188,206 individuals in the intervention arms, 123,686 (66%) received two complete doses, and 64,520 (34%) received one or no doses of the OCV. The vaccine uptake rate was higher in females than males (aOR: 1.80; 95% CI = 1.75-1.84) and in younger (<15 years) than older participants (aOR: 2.19; 95% CI = 2.13-3.26). Individuals living in their own house or having a higher monthly family expenditure were more likely to receive the OCV (aOR: 1.60; 95% CI = 1.50-1.70 and aOR: 1.14; 95% CI = 1.10-1.18 respectively). Individuals using treated water for drinking or using own tap as the source of water were more likely to receive the OCV (aOR: 1.23; 95% CI = 1.17-1.29 and aOR: 1.14; 95% CI = 1.02-1.25 respectively) than their counterpart. Vaccine uptake was also significantly higher in participants residing farther away from health facilities (aOR: 95% 1.80; Cl = 136-2.37).
   Conclusion: The GIS was useful in designing field activities, facilitating vaccine delivery and identifying socioeconomic drivers of vaccine uptake in the urban area of Bangladesh. Addressing these socioeconomic drivers may help improve OCV uptake, thereby effectiveness of the OCV in a community. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: This study evaluated the immunogenicity and safety of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine using tetanus (T) toxoid as carrier protein (MenACWY-TT) co-administered with combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) versus their separate administration in adolescents and young adults.
   Methods: In this phase III, randomized, partially-blind study (NCT01767376), healthy 11-25-year-olds (N = 660) were randomized (1:1:1) to receive MenACWY-TT and Tdap at Month 0 (Co-ad group), MenACVVY-TT at Month 0 and Tdap at Month 1 (ACWY_Tdap group) or Tdap at Month 0 and MenACVVY-TT at Month 1 (Tdap_ACWY group). Immune responses to MenACWY-TT were measured by serum bactericidal assay using rabbit complement (rSBA). Anti-diphtheria (D), anti-tetanus (T), anti-pertussis toxin (PT), anti-filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and anti-pertactin (PRN) antibody concentrations were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Non-inferiority of immunogenicity was assessed using pre-defined clinical criteria. Safety was also evaluated.
   Results: Non-inferiority of immunogenicity of MenACWY-TT and Tdap when co-administered versus their separate administration was demonstrated in terms of rSBA geometric mean titers (GMTs) for 4 meningococcal serogroups and of the percentage of participants with antibody concentrations >1 IU/ml for D and T. Among the pertussis antigens, non-inferiority criteria for geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were reached for PT, but not met for FHA and PRN. Across all groups, >= 93.2% of participants had vaccine responses to each meningococcal serogroup, >= 99.1% were seroprotected against T and D, and >= 85.5% had booster responses to each pertussis antigen. Robust increases in antibody GMTs/GMCs were observed for all antigens between pre-and post-vaccination. Both vaccines had clinically acceptable safety profiles.
   Conclusion: Immune responses to MenACWY-TT and to the T and D antigens from Tdap were not impacted by their co-administration. The lower antibody concentrations observed against the pertussis components may be of limited clinical relevance since robust anti-pertussis booster responses were observed. This study supports concurrent administration of the 2 vaccines in adolescents. (C) 2018 GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   hospitalizations in England - An interrupted time series analysis
SO VACCINE
LA English
DT Article
DE Rotavirus; Seizures; Vaccine; Convulsion
ID GASTROENTERITIS; CHILDREN
AB Observational studies have linked a reduction in childhood seizures (CS) to the introduction of rotavirus vaccination (RV). England is opportunely placed to explore this due to well-defined introduction, high uptake of RV and centralised Hospital Episodes Statistics recording all admissions. We investigated the association between seizures and vaccine use through interrupted time-series analysis of all CS admissions in children <3 years old (ICD-10 codes; G40*-G41*, R56.0*) during 2007-2017. We did not detect a statistically significant association between the introduction of RV and admission with febrile (p = 0.84), afebrile (p = 0.83) or all CS (p = 0.93), even when limited to peak rotavirus seasonality (March). This is the first ecological study in a country that exclusively uses the monovalent vaccine. Although a negative finding, we would argue that if an effect cannot be detected at this population level then it is unlikely to be clinically or economically significant but generates hypotheses of potential nonspecific effects.

   HEALTH-RISKS; GROUP-C; OUTBREAK
AB Background: Mass gatherings (MGs) such as the Hajj and Umrah pilgrimages are known to amplify the risk of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) due to enhanced transmission of the organism between attendees. The burden of IMD at MGs other than Hajj and Umrah has not previously been quantified through a systematic review.
   Methods: A systematic search for relevant articles in PubMed and Embase was conducted using MeSH terms; this was buttressed by hand searching. Following data abstraction, a narrative synthesis was conducted to quantify the burden of IMD at MGs and identify potential risk factors and mitigation measures.
   Results: Thirteen studies reporting occurrence of IMD at MGs or similar crowded settings were identified. Eight studies reported cases or outbreaks in MGs of >= 1000 people; five others reported IMD in other crowded settings; all occurred between 1991 and 2015. All age groups were involved in the identified studies; however the majority of cases (similar to 80%) were young people aged 15-24 years. The number of affected people ranged from one to 321 cases and the overall crude estimate of incidence was calculated as 66 per 100,000 individuals. Serogroups A, C, B and W were identified, with serogroups A and C being most common. Of 450 cases of IMD reported in non-Hajj/Umrah MGs, 67 (14.9%) had fatal outcomes.
   Conclusion: IMD outbreaks at non-Hajj/Umrah MGs are generally much smaller than Hajj-related outbreaks and affect mainly young people. Health education and vaccination should be considered for attendees of high risk non-Hajj/Umrah MGs, especially those involving adolescents and young adults. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Meningococcal disease is a serious public health threat given the seriousness of the illness, its disabling sequelae and its potential for epidemic spread. The disease is a concern during mass gatherings which provide conditions that facilitate transmission of infectious agents including Neisseria meningitidis. Implementation of appropriate meningococcal disease preventive measures during at-risk mass gatherings is crucial to prevent illness and outbreaks which may result in significant morbidity and mortality as well as local and international spread of the disease. These preventive measures should be informed by comprehensive risk assessments of the disease at those events and may include the use of vaccination, chemoprophylaxis and health awareness and educational campaigns, supported by efficient disease surveillance and response systems. The Hajj and Umrah religious mass gatherings in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are examples of how the implementation of such preventive measures was successful in reducing the incidence of meningococcal disease during these events as well as controlling and preventing outbreaks. Lessons learned from the Hajj and Umrah experience can inform meningococcal disease preventive strategies for other mass gatherings worldwide. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Adjuvanted herpes zoster subunit vaccine; Older adults;
   Cost-effectiveness; Hong Kong
ID POSTHERPETIC NEURALGIA; EFFICACY; THRESHOLDS
AB Background: Adjuvanted herpes zoster (HZ) subunit vaccine is recommended for adults aged >= 50 years. This study aimed to investigate cost-effectiveness of HZ subunit vaccine for older adults at different age in Hong Kong.
   Methods: A life-long Markov model was designed to simulate outcomes of four alternatives: Vaccination at model entry (age 50 years); deferring vaccination to 60 years; deferring vaccination to 70 years; and no vaccination. Outcome measures included direct cost, indirect cost, HZ and post-herpetic neuralgia incidences, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) loss, and incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER). Model clinical inputs were derived from literature. HZ treatment costs were collected from a cohort of HZ patients (n = 218). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.
   Results: In base-case analysis, vaccination at 50 years showed highest QALYs saved and increment cost (0.00258; USD166), followed by deferring to 60 years (0.00215 QALYs saved; USD102) and deferring to 70 years (0.00134 QALYs; USD62) when comparing to no vaccination. ICERs of vaccination arms versus no vaccine (46,267-64,341 USD/QALY) were between 1-3 x gross domestic product (GPD) per capita in Hong Kong (USD43,530-USD130,590). One-way sensitivity analyses found vaccine cost to be the common and most influential parameter for ICER of each vaccination strategy to become <1 x GDP per capita. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, vaccination at 50 years, deferring to 60 years and 70 years were accepted as cost-effective in 90% of time at willingness-to-pay (WTP) of 78,400 USD/QALY, 57,680 USD/QALY and 53,760 USD/QALY, respectively.
   Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness of each strategy is highly subject to the vaccine cost and WTP threshold per QALY saved. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB HIV-1 diversity and latent reservoir are the major challenges for the development of an effective AIDS vaccine. It is well indicated that Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells serve as the dominant host immune surveillance for HIV-1 control, but it still remains a challenge for vaccine design to induce broader and stronger cytotoxic T cell immunity against the virus. Genetic variation of the HIV-1 gag gene across different clades is one of the reasons for the reduction of antigenic epitope coverage. Here, we report an immunization strategy with heterologous vaccines expressing a mosaic Gag antigen aimed to increase antigenic breadth against a wider spectrum of HIV-1 strains. Priming using a DNA vaccine via in vivo electroporation, followed by boosting with a live replication-competent modified vaccinia TianTan (MVTT) vectored vaccine, elicited greater and broader protective Gag-specific immune responses in mice. Compared to DNA or MVTT homologous immunization, the heterologous DNA/MVTT vaccination resulted in higher frequencies of broadly reactive, Gag-specific, polyfunctional, long-lived cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells, as well as increased anti-Gag antibody titer. Importantly, the DNA/MVTT heterologous vaccination induced protection against EcoHIV and mesothelioma AB1-Gag challenges. In summary, the stronger protective Gag specific immunity induced by the heterologous regimen using two safe vectors shows promise for further development to enhance anti-HIV-1 immunity. Our study has important implications for immunogen design and the development of an effective HIV-1 heterologous vaccination strategy. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: This prevalence-based, cost-of-illness study estimated the health care costs of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection-associated diseases in the era before the introduction of organized HPV vaccination for 12-year-old girls in 2016, South Korea.
   Methods: The claims data provided by the National Health Insurance Service was used to estimate the prevalence of HPV-associated diseases and their direct medical costs, including costs related to hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and medications.
   Results: A total of 1.3 million men and women used medical services for HPV-attributed diseases between 2002 and 2015. Among women, the most common diseases attributable to HPV were cervical dysplasia (64.4%), anogenital warts (12.9%), cervical carcinoma in situ (10.7%) and cervical cancer (2.6%), whereas anogenital warts (80.6%), benign neoplasms of larynx (14.3%), and anal cancers (8.9%) were most common among men. In 2015, the healthcare cost attributable to HPV was 124.9 million US dollars (USD) representing 69.0% of the annual cost of all HPV-associated diseases. At a cost of 75.1 million USD, cervical cancer contributed the largest economic burden in 2015 followed by cervical dysplasia (19.4 million USD) and cervical carcinoma in situ (10.7 million USD). These three conditions represented 58.2% of the total annual cost of all HPV-associated diseases, while 84.2% of the total annual cost was attributable to HPV. Annual health care costs increased from 42.6 million USD in 2002 to 180.9 million USD in 2015.
   Conclusion: The healthcare costs associated with HPV-related diseases in Korea are substantial and increased between 2002 and 2015 mainly caused by increased number of patients. Expanding the target age for HPV vaccination of girls and introducing HPV vaccination for boys are possible ways of reducing the economic burden of HPV-associated disease and should be considered.

AB In earlier works we have described that mice immunized with outer membrane protein OmpC survive the challenge with live Shigella flexnerii 3a. We have also identified conformational epitope of this protein, that was recognized by mice antibodies. The aim of current work was to investigate whether synthetic OmpC epitope homologs can elicit immunological response sufficient in protecting mice against shigellosis. Several linear peptides containing RYDERY motif were synthesized and conjugated to poly-lysine. These conjugates appeared to be poor immunogens and to boost the immunological response an addition of the adjuvant (MPL) was required. Unfortunately, the MPL alone caused a very high immunological reaction that was masking response to peptidic epitope. Under those circumstances we used tetanus toxoid (TT) as the carrier protein for the peptides and the agent stimulating immunological response. Series of cyclic peptides, homologs of the OmpC main epitope were synthesized and conjugated to TT. The loop size in cyclic peptides varied by number of glycine residues, i.e., 1-3 residues added to the GLNRYDERYIGK motif. The linear GLNRYDERYIGC-TT was also prepared as the control. The latter conjugate gave the highest immunological response, followed by the cyclic-GGLNRYDERYIGC-TT and cyclic-GLNRYDERYIGC-TT. The third peptide, cyclic-GGGLNRYDERYIGC-TT, gave a very low response, although it was the most resistant to proteolysis. However, antibodies obtained against cyclic-GGLNRYDERYIGC-TT were more potent to recognize both OmpC and Shigella flexnerii 3a cells than the antibodies against linear GLNRYDERYIGC-11. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibodies raised against linear GLNRYDERYIGC-TT showed 20-fold lower dissociation constant (KD) than the naturally occurring polyclonal antibodies from umbilical cord sera. Monoclonal antibodies also gave a weaker signal in electron microscope than mice and human polyclonal antibodies. In overall, our results point to cyclic peptides as better candidates for a vaccine development, since they are eliciting production of the higher affinity antibodies against Shigella cells and OmpC.

AB Japanese encephalitis (JE) live attenuated vaccine SA14-14-2 is the most widely used JE vaccine in the world. Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated satisfactory safety and efficacy profiles. The establishment of genetic and attenuated neurovirulence characteristics and their stabilities of SA14-14-2 virus are important in relation to vaccine safety in humans. Therefore, several researchers have studied and analyzed the full-length gene sequences of the SA14-14-2 virus strain. However, sequencing results have shown a significant difference. Here, we further studied the full-length sequence of three class seed virus banks of the vaccine as well as two vaccine viruses with different passages in primary hamster kidney cells, and compared them with our original stored SA14 parent virus (low passage in mouse brain). The full-length gene sequence determined in this study indicates there were 57 nucleotide and 25 amino acid substitutions of the SA14-14-2 strain compared to its parental SA14 virus strain. The full-length sequences of the three class seed bank viruses and the vaccine virus PHKC8 were completely identical among them, but the working seed virus passaged in primary hamster kidney cells for 17 generations (PHKC17) had a single nucleotide change at the 5' NCR. Both KM and ICR mice tested by intracerebral (i.c.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) routes with the three class seed viruses and vaccine viruses with >= 5.7 Igpfu/mL remained healthy, but all the mice inoculated with the SA14 parental virus strain died as early as day 5 post -inoculation. The present study provided new information on the full-length gene sequence and attenuated neurovirulence of SA14-14-2. They can be used as a reference sequence for vaccine quality control and surveillance of neurovirulence reversion following vaccination. Moreover, the present results further demonstrated the high genetic and phenotypic stabilities of the SA14-14-2 virus, suggesting the neurovirulence reversion of the vaccine strain will be highly unlikely.

AB Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Protection against RSV is associated with neutralizing antibodies against the fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins. Several RSV vaccine candidates are in development, but their immunogenicity is hard to compare due to the little-understood differences between multiple RSV neutralizing antibody assays used. Existing assays utilize primarily Vero or HEp-2 cells, but their ability to detect G-neutralizing antibodies or antibodies against specific RSV strains is unclear. In this work, we developed an RSV microneutralization assay (MNA) using unmodified RSV and immortalized cell line derived from human airway epithelial cells (A549). Performance of A549-, HEp-2- and Vero-based MNA was compared under the same assay conditions (fixed amount of virus and cells) with regards to detection of neutralizing antibodies against RSV A or B viruses, G-reactive neutralizing antibodies, and effect of complement. Our results indicate that A549 cells yield the highest MNA titers, particularly in the RSV A/A2 MNA, are least susceptible to complement enhancing effect of neutralizing titer readout and are superior to Vero or HEp-2 MNA at recognizing G-reactive neutralizing antibodies when no complement is used. Vero cells, however, can be more consistent at recognizing neutralizing antibodies against multiple RSV strains. The choice of substrate cells thus affects the outcome of MNA, as some immortalized cells better support detection of broader range of neutralizing antibodies, while others facilitate detection of G-targeting neutralizing antibodies, a long thought prerogative of primary airway epithelial cells.

AB Multivalent tetanus and diphtheria toxoid containing vaccines belong to the most frequently applied vaccines. However, there is an imbalance in the degree of protection against the two antigens with insufficient long-term protection against diphtheria, particularly in the elderly population. We have previously reported a positive correlation between granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the production of diphtheria-specific antibodies. Therefore, in the present study we analyzed the effects of in vivo applied recombinant GM-CSF on immunization with multivalent tetanus/diphtheria vaccine in mice of different age. In vivo application of GM-CSF lead to enhanced production of diphtheria-specific antibodies as well as more diphtheria-specific CD4(+) T cells following vaccination with multivalent tetanus/diphtheria vaccine. In contrast, the humoral and cellular immune response to the tetanus component was unaltered. Furthermore, application of GM-CSF resulted in more splenic CD11b(+) dendritic cells (DCs) with a higher MHC-II expression. GM-CSF also induced a stronger recruitment of CD11b(+) DCs to the injected muscle. Most remarkably, GM-CSF was able to boost the diphtheria-specific immune response to the multivalent vaccine in aged mice. This study demonstrates that local administration of GM-CSF is able to improve immune responsiveness to the diphtheria component of multivalent tetanus/diphtheria vaccine in young and old mice. This information could be useful for the future design of vaccines for the elderly. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY license.

AB Objectives: To assess the prevalence of protective antibody titers to polioviruses in adults candidates for solid organ transplant (SOT), and to assess the immunogenic response to inactivated polio vaccine in this population.
   Methods: The study included SOT candidates referred to Immunization Reference Centre of Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases from March 2013 to January 2016. It was conducted in 2 phases. The first one, a cross-sectional seroprevalence study, followed by an uncontrolled analysis of vaccine response among patients without protective antibody titers at baseline. Antibody titers to poliomyelitis were determined by microneutralization assay.
   Results: Among 206 SOT candidates included, 156 (76%) had protective antibody titers to all poliovirus serotypes (95% CI: 70-81%). Proven history of oral vaccination in childhood was not associated with higher seroprevalence of protective antibody. In 97% of individuals without protective antibody titers at baseline, there was adequate vaccine response with one dose of inactivated polio vaccine.
   Conclusions: A relevant proportion of adult candidates for SOT does not have protective titers of antibodies to one or more poliovirus serotype. One dose of inactivated vaccine elicited protective antibody titers in 97% of these subjects and should be routinely prescribed prior to SOT. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Tailoring immunisation programmes: Using behavioural insights to
   identify barriers and enablers to childhood immunisations in a Jewish
   community in London, UK

AB Introduction: Due to regular vaccine preventable disease outbreaks and sub-optimal immunisation uptake in the London borough of Hackney, home to the largest Charedi Orthodox Jewish community in Europe, it was decided, in consultation with the community, to implement the WHO Tailoring Immunization Programmes approach (TIP).
   Design: The WHO Tailoring Immunization Programmes (TIP) approach was used. TIP provides a framework based on behavioural insights methodology to identify populations susceptible to vaccine preventable diseases, diagnose supply and demand side barriers and enablers to vaccination and recommend evidence-informed responses to improve vaccination coverage.
   Results: The results of the formative research and behavioural analysis challenged the assumption that a cultural or religious anti-vaccination sentiment existed within the community. Critical issues related to access to and convenience of immunisation services. Service providers in the area have challenges due to having to deliver immunisation services to the large numbers of children without additional resource. Where mothers were choosing to delay or refuse vaccinations their reasons were broadly similar to the wider population. The behavioural analysis identified potential categorisation of subgroups within the community enabling a more tailored approach to addressing concerns and meeting parents' needs.
   Conclusion: The TIP approach was an effective way of investigating factors linked to sub-optimal immunisation within the Charedi community. The use of behavioural insights enabled the categorisation of subgroups so that more targeted interventions could be developed. The comprehensive stakeholder engagement which is a key pillar of the TIP approach ensured a deeper understanding of the barriers and enablers to vaccination as well as increasing the level of ownership in the community. TIP should be considered as a useful approach to identify main facilitators and barriers to vaccination in communities with suboptimal immunisation uptake. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is an important cause of infant mortality. Here, we estimated the potential impact of maternal vaccination against RSV on life-threatening RSV infection in infants.
   Methods: We developed a mathematical model for maternal vaccine-induced antibody dynamics and used characteristics of a maternal RSV vaccine currently in phase 3 of clinical development. The model was applied to data from two cohorts of children younger than 12 months with RSV-related paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission in the United Kingdom (n = 370) and the Netherlands (n = 167), and a cohort of 211 children younger than 12 months with RSV-related in-hospital death from 20 countries worldwide.
   Results: Our model predicted that, depending on vaccine efficiency, maternal vaccination at 30 weeks' gestational age could have prevented 62-75% of RSV-related PICU admissions in the United Kingdom and 76-87% in the Netherlands. For the global mortality cohort, the model predicted that maternal vaccination could have prevented 29-48% of RSV-related in-hospital deaths. Preterm children and children with comorbidities were predicted to benefit less than (healthy) term children.
   Conclusions: Maternal vaccination against RSV may substantially decrease life-threatening RSV infections in infants. (C) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license.

AB The 13-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV13) was recommended for childhood immunization programs in 2010 in Canada and has decreased the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and changed the epidemiology of IPD in adults. This study investigated the epidemiology of IPD in adults 65 years of age and older in Canada. A total of 7282 invasive S. pneumoniae isolated from adults >= 65 years old were serotyped from 2010 to 2016 and antimicrobial susceptibility was performed on 2527 isolates. Serotyping was performed by Quellung reaction using commercial antisera and antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution. PCV7 serotypes decreased non-significantly from 2010 to 2016 from 9.1% (n = 96) to 6.7% (n = 72) while the additional six PCV13 serotypes declined significantly from 39.5% (n = 418) to 18.6% (n = 201) (p < 0.05). The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) and non-vaccine (NVT) serotypes increased from 26.3% (n = 278) to 36.2% (n = 393) (p < 0.05), and from 25.1% (n = 266) to 38.4% (n = 416) (p < 0.05), respectively. There were no significant changes in antimicrobial resistance rates from 2011 to 2016: 24.1% of the IPD from adults >= 65 years were resistant to clarithromycin (n = 609), 10.0% to doxycycline (n = 254), 11.8% to penicillin (n = 299), 5.2% to cefuroxime (n = 131), 6.6% to clindamycin (n = 168), 6.0% to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (n = 152), and 0.5% (n = 12) to ceftriaxone. Although overall incidence of IPD in adults >= 65 years has remained relatively constant from 2010 to 2016, childhood PCV13 vaccination programs have been successful in indirectly reducing IPD caused by PCV13 serotypes in adults through herd immunity effects.

AB Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is responsible for causing severe economic losses to cattle farmers throughout Africa, the Middle East, and more recently, South-Eastern Europe and Russia. It belongs to the Capripoxvirus genus of the Poxviridae family, with closely related sheeppox and goatpox viruses. Like other poxviruses, the viral genome codes for a number of genes with putative immunomodulatory capabilities. Current vaccines for protecting cattle against lumpy skin disease (LSD) based on live attenuated strains of field isolates passaged by cell culture, resulting in random mutations. Although generally effective, these vaccines can have drawbacks, including injection site reactions and/or limited immunogenicity. A pilot study was conducted using a more targeted approach where two putative immunomodulatory genes were deleted separately from the genome of a virulent LSDV field isolate. These were open reading frame (ORF) 005 and ORF008, coding for homologues of an interleukin 10-like and interferon-gamma receptor-like gene, respectively. The resulting knockout constructs were evaluated in cattle for safety, immunogenicity and protection. Severe post-vaccinal reactions and febrile responses were observed for both constructs. Two calves inoculated with the ORF008 knockout construct developed multiple lesions and were euthanised. Following challenge, none of the animals inoculated with the knockout constructs showed any external clinical signs of LSD, compared to the negative controls. Improved cellular and humoral immune responses were recorded in both of these groups compared to the positive control. The results indicate that at the high inoculation doses used, the degree of attenuation achieved was insufficient for further use in cattle due to the adverse reactions observed.

AB Background: Using a survey conducted during the 2013-2014 polio outbreak in Somalia, this study examines attitudinal and knowledge-based threats to oral polio vaccine acceptance and commitment. Findings address a key gap, as most prior research focuses on endemic settings.
   Methods: Between November 19 and December 21, 2013, we conducted interviews among 2003 care givers of children under 5 years in select districts at high risk for polio transmission. Within each district, sample was drawn via a multi-stage cluster design with random route household selection. We calculated the percentage of caregivers who could not confirm recent vaccination and those uncommitted to future vaccination. We compared these percentages among caregivers with varying knowledge and attitudes, focusing on variables identified as threats in endemic settings, using controlled and uncontrolled comparisons. We also examined absolute levels of threat variables.
   Results: Only 10% of caregivers could not confirm recent vaccination, but 32% were uncommitted to future vaccination. Being unvaccinated or uncommitted were related to multiple threat variables. For example, compared with relevant counterparts, caregivers were more likely to be unconfirmed and uncommitted if they did not trust vaccinators "a great deal" (unconfirmed: 9% vs. 2%; uncommitted: 49% vs. 28%), which is also true in endemic settings. Unlike endemic settings, symptom knowledge was related to commitment while rumor awareness was low and unrelated to past acceptance or commitment. Levels of trust and perceptions of OPV effectiveness were high, though perceptions of community support and awareness of logistics were lower.
   Conclusions: As in endemic settings, outbreak responses will benefit from communications strategies focused on enhancing trust in vaccinators, institutions and the vaccine, alongside making community support visible. Disease facts may help motivate acceptance, and enhanced logistics information may help facilitate caregiver availability at the door. Quelling rumors early may be important to prevent them from becoming threats. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: We have previously demonstrated that polyfunctional Ty21a-responsive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells are generated at the duodenal mucosa 18 days following vaccination with live-attenuated S. Typhi (Ty21a). The longevity of cellular responses has been assessed in peripheral blood, but persistence of duodenal responses is unknown.
   Methods: We vaccinated eight healthy adults with Ty21a. Peripheral blood and duodenal samples were acquired after a median of 1.5 years (ranging from 1.1 to 3.7 years) following vaccination. Cellular responses were assessed in peripheral blood and at the duodenal mucosa by flow cytometry. Levels of IgG and IgA were also assessed in peripheral blood by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Results: No T-cell responses were observed at the duodenal mucosa, but CD4(+) T-cell responses to Ty2la and FliC were observed in peripheral blood. Peripheral anti-lipopolysaccharide IgG and IgA responses were also observed. Early immunoglobulin responses were not associated with the persistence of long term cellular immune responses.
   Conclusions: Early T-cell responses which we have previously observed at the duodenal mucosa 18 days following oral vaccination with Ty21a could not be detected at a median of 1.5 years. Peripheral responses were observed at this time. lmmunoglobulin responses observed shortly after vaccination were not associated with cellular immune responses at 1.5 years, suggesting that the persistence of cellular immunity is not associated with the strength of the initial humoral response to vaccination.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB L-type lectins are involved in glycoprotein secretion and are associated with immune responses. Herein, an L-type lectin was identified in swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus). The 1347 bp PtLTL cDNA includes a 26 bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a 547 bp 3'-UTR with a poly(A) tail, and a 774 bp open reading frame encoding a 257 amino acid protein with a putative 21 residue signalling peptide. The protein includes an L-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain containing four conserved cysteines. The 714 bp cDNA fragment encoding the mature peptide of PtLTL1 was recombined into pET-21a (+) with a C-terminally hexa-histidine tag fused in frame and expressed in Escherichia coli Origami (DE3). Recombinant PtLTL1 caused agglutination of all three Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains tested. In addition, erythrocyte agglutination and LPS-binding activity were observed. PtLTL1 mRNA transcripts were most abundant in P. trituberculatus hepatopancreas and hemocytes, and expression was up-regulated in hemocytes challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus, suggesting PtLTL functions in the immune response against bacterial pathogens.

AB The medicinal leeches have been widely utilized in medical procedures for thousands of years. Recently, there were more and more transcriptomes of leech published online including the medicinal leech (Hirudo medicinalis) and some other leeches. However, leech's genetic backgrounds are still largely unknown. In this report, transcriptomes of three phylogenetically close leeches (Poecilobdella javanica, Whitmania pigra, and Haemadipsa cavatuses) were established by RNA-seq technique for studying their genetic mechanisms of environmental adaption. Over 110 million high-quality reads were generated and assembled into unique transcriptom (reads = 200 bp). 27,138 out of de novo assembled transcripts (41.77%) were assigned to one or more GO terms. Additionally, the transcripts were detected in 217 predicted KEGG pathways. The enriched genes were involved in protein metabolism, GPCRs and pathogen-resistant pathways. The results showed that the great variations existed in gene expression of olfactory transduction pathway among three leech species. The comparisons of leech species hinted at the underlying mechanism of leeches adapting well in various environments. Our study will provide useful rationales for future studies of leeches and other annelid species.

   INFORMATION
AB As one of the most important and common protein post-translational modifications, citrullination plays a key role in regulating various biological processes and is associated with several human diseases. The accurate identification of citrullination sites is crucial for elucidating the underlying molecular mechanisms of citrullination and designing drugs for related human diseases. In this study, a novel bioinformatics tool named CKSAAP_CitrSite is developed for the prediction of citrullination sites. With the assistance of support vector machine algorithm, the highlight of CKSAAP_CitrSite is to adopt the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs surrounding a query site as input. As illustrated by 10-fold cross-validation, CKSAAP_CitrSite achieves a satisfactory performance with a Sensitivity of 77.59%, a Specificity of 95.26%, an Accuracy of 89.37% and a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.7566, which is much better than those of the existing prediction method.' Feature analysis shows that the N-terminal space containing pairs may play an important role in the prediction of citrullination sites, and the arginines close to N-terminus tend to be citrullinated. The conclusions derived from this study could offer useful information for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of citrullination and related experimental validations. A user-friendly web-server for CKSAAP_CitrSite is available at 123.206.31.171/CKSAAP_CitrSite/.

AB The plant ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters are one of the integral membrane proteins responsible for uptake and allocation of a wide range of metabolites and xenobiotics including heavy metals (e.g. zinc, manganese and cadmium). They play multiple roles in plant growth, development and environmental stress responses. Although the ABC transporters have been identified in model plants such as Arabidopsis and rice, they are have not been annotated and identified in rapeseed (Brassica napus) and also, little is known about functionality of these metal transporters. B. napus is an important oil crop ranking the third largest source of vegetable oil worldwide. Importantly, it is long considered as a desirable candidate for phytoremediation owning to its massive dry weight productivity and moderate Cd accumulation. In this study, we identified 314 ABC protein genes from B. napus using bioinformatics and high-throughput sequencing. Eight subfamilies including ABCA-G and ABCI have been categorized. The ABCG proteins constitute the largest subfamily with 116 members, and the ABCB and ABCC subfamilies ranks second and third with 69 and 47 members, respectively. Analyses of ABCs in B. napus genome reveal that their evolutional expansion was through localized allele duplications. Most of the ABC genes (74.2%, 233/314) were validated by RNA-sequencing rapeseed seedlings. Among the 233 profiled BnaABCs, 132 genes were differentially expressed (> 1.5 fold change, p < 0.05) and 84 genes were significantly induced under Cd stress. Analyses of specific cis-elements in the upstream of eight representative genes show diverse motifs, which potentially respond to environmental stress, hormone responsiveness and other development signals.

ID GOATS CAPRA-HIRCUS; IDENTIFICATION; INFERTILITY; TESTIS
AB Seasonal estrus is a critical limiting factor for animal fecundity. However, estrus occurs in some seasonally estrous sheep in the non-breeding season, and this phenomenon involves changes in ovarian biology. Previous studies indicated that small RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), play important regulatory roles in ovarian biology. Differentially expressed miRNAs in the ovaries of estrous sheep were identified using Solexa sequencing technology. A total of 423 known miRNAs were identified in ovaries of estrous sheep in the breeding season and non-breeding season. In the comparison of these two groups, 48 miRNAs were identified that were differentially expressed between the two groups (including 5 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated miRNAs). KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the target genes of some differentially expressed miRNAs were involved in pathways related to reproductive hormone signaling and follicular development. Furthermore, the levels of estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were lower in anestrus sheep than in sheep during the breeding season. Upon combining the pathway enrichment analysis, target gene expression and hormone measurement results, we suggest that these differentially expressed miRNAs might influence ovarian activity in the non-breeding season by regulating the above pathways. The identification of miRNAs that are differentially expressed between ovines in the breeding season and non-breeding season will contribute to our understanding of the role of miRNAs in estrus regulation, and these data may provide a basis for regulating estrus in sheep during the non-breeding season.

AB Bacillus subtilis QST713 is extensively used as a biological control agent in agricultural fields including in the button mushroom culture, Agaricus bisporus. This last use exploits its inhibitory activity against microbial pathogens such as Trichoderma aggressivum f. europaeum, the main button mushroom green mould competitor. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of this bacterium with a genome size of 4 233 757 bp, 4263 predicted genes and an average GC content of 45.9%. Based on phylogenomic analyses, strain QST713 is finally designated as Bacillus velezensis. Genomic analyses revealed two clusters encoding potential new antimicrobials with NRPS and TransATPKS synthetase. B. velezensis QST713 genome also harbours several genes previously described as being involved in surface colonization and biofilm formation. This strain shows a strong ability to form in vitro spatially organized biofilm and to antagonize T. aggressivum. The availability of this genome sequence could bring new elements to understand the interactions with micro or/and macroorganisms in crops.

AB Cotton is an important crop that is continuously cultivated around the world. However, its production has decreased in recent times due to wide ranging insects and also current practices of using synthetic insecticides that are not precise and their residues impairing the biodiversity. Hence, the search for newer classes of efficient entomotoxic proteins continues. Genetically modified cotton crops with cry genes from Bacillus thuringiensis, have been cultivated across the world, which overcome the chewing type insect menace. In the present study, we assess the development of transgenic cotton plants by Agrobacterium, wherein the confirmed kanamycin resistant T-0 plants were advanced to T-1 generation and the gene integration was studied by molecular analysis. Western blot and ELISA assays demonstrated the expression of 0.46% lectin of the total soluble leaf proteins. In planta bioassay showed 69% of aphid, Aphis gossypii population reduction with T-1 generation plants. Whereas 100% insect mortality is occurred in Spodoptera litura larvae by 96 h. Present findings shows the potent insecticidal effect of Sclerotium rolfsii lectin on sucking (homopteran) and chewing (lepidopteron) insects, underlining its significance and strengthening genetic resources in cotton breeding against different order insect pests.

AB Even though there has been much interest in genetic engineering of microalgae, its progress has been slow due to the difficulty and limitation of available techniques. Currently, genetic modification in most microalgal strains is confined to single gene transformation. Here, a multigene expression system for the oleaginous model strain Nannochloropsis salina was developed with glycine-serine-glycine spacer linked 2A self-cleaving peptides (2A) for the first time. An efficiency test of the four most widely used 2As revealed that two different types of 2As T2A and E2A have the best performance in N. salina with a maximum cleavage rate of nearly 45%. The system was able to express the linked sequence of the selection marker shble and the fluorescence protein sfCherry with intact functions. Because 2A enabled multigene expression in the single cassette form, the use of 2A also reduced the vector size, which along with the stronger promoter resulted in a 9-fold increase in the transformation efficiency. Furthermore, confirmative screening accuracy of more than 90% was observed. Hence, the 2A applied vector system is expected to be beneficial in microalgal research field because it enables multigene expression as well as offering improved transformation and screening efficiency.

AB Tau is a multifunctional protein, originally identified as a cytoplasmic protein associated with microtubules. It is codified by the MAPT gene, and the alternative splicing, in the neuronal cells, results in six different isoforms. Tau was subsequently observed in the cell nucleus, where its function is not yet clearly understood. Here, we studied the MAPT gene and the cellular localization of the AT8 and Tau-1 epitopes of Tau protein, in the SK-N-BE cell line, which differentiates in neuronal-like cells after retinoic acid treatment. These epitopes correspond to the phosphorylated Ser202/Thr205 and unphosphorylated Pro189/G1y207 amino acid residues, respectively, possibly involved in conformational changes of the protein. Our results demonstrated the presence of the smaller Tau isoform (352 amino acids), whose amount increases in differentiated SK-N-BE cells, with Tau-1/AT8 nuclear distribution related to the differentiation process. Tau-1 showed a spot-like nucleolar localization, in both replicative and differentiated cells, while AT8 was only detected in the differentiated cells, diffusely occupying the entire nucleolar region. Moreover, in the replicative cells exposed to actinomycin-D, AT8 and Tau-1 move to the nucleolar periphery and colocalize, in few spots, with the upstream binding transcription factor (UBTF). Our results, also obtained with lymphocytes exposed to the mitogenic compound phytohaemagglutinin, indicate the AT8 epitope of Tau as a marker of neuronal cell differentiation, whose presence in the nucleolus appears to be related to rDNA transcriptional inactivation.

AB Genetic mutations in dozens of monogenic genes can lead to serious podocyte dysfunction, which is a major cause of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). The NUP160 gene is expressed in both human kidney and mouse kidney. However, whether knockdown of NUP160 impairs podocytes has not yet been established. Therefore, we knocked down NUP160 by targeted short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes and observed the effect of NUP160 knockdown on the proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy and cell migration of podocytes. We also investigated the effect of NUP160 knockdown on the expression and localization of podocyte associated molecules, such as nephrin, podocin, CD2AP and alpha-actinin-4. The knockdown of NUP160 significantly inhibited the proliferation of podocytes by decreasing the expression of both cyclin D1 and CDK4, increasing the expression of p27, and inducing S phase arrest. The knockdown of NUP160 promoted the apoptosis and autophagy of podocytes, and enhanced cell migration. The knockdown of NUP160 decreased the expression of nephrin, podocin and CD2AP in podocytes, and increased the expression of a-actinin-4. The knockdown of NUP160 also altered the subcellular localization of nephrin, podocin and CD2AP in podocytes. These results suggest that the knockdown of NUP160 impairs mouse podocytes, i.e. inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, autophagy and cell migration of mouse podocytes, and altering the expression and localization of podocyte associated molecules, including nephrin, podocin, CD2AP and alpha-actinin-4.

AB Background: The HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) is a well-known long noncoding RNA (IncRNA) that plays a critical role in biological processes in most cancers. However, the function of HOTAIR in bladder cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we hypothesize that tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) in HOTAIR are associated with bladder cancer (BCa) risk.
   Methods: We performed a hospital-based case-control study of 1050 cases and 1407 controls to investigate the associations between tagSNPs and the risk of BCa in a Chinese population.
   Results: We found that individuals with the rs874945 AG/AA genotype had a significantly increased risk of BCa compared with those carrying the GG genotype, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.04-1.46, P = 0.014]. The subsequently stratified analyses showed that the increased risk was more pronounced in subgroups of older subjects (age > 60 years), never smokers and subjects without pack-years of smoking. Interactive analysis showed that there was no interaction effect between smoking status and rs874945.
   Conclusion: Our study showed that rs874945 in HOTAIR was associated with BCa risk in a Chinese population.

AB Begomoviruses belong to the family Geminiviridae are associated with several disease symptoms, such as mosaic and leaf curling in Jatropha curcas. The molecular characterization of these viral strains will help in developing management strategies to control the disease. In this study, J. curcas that was infected with begomovirus and showed acute leaf curling symptoms were identified. DNA-A segment from pathogenic viral strain was isolated and sequenced. The sequenced genome was assembled and characterized in detail. The full-length DNA-A sequence was covered by primer walking. The genome sequence showed the general organization of DNA-A from begomovirus by the distribution of ORFs in both viral and anti-viral strands. The genome size ranged from 2844 bp-2852 bp. Three strains with minor nucleotide variations were identified, and a phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the DNA-A segments from other reported begomovirus isolates. The maximum sequence similarity was observed with Euphorbia yellow mosaic virus (FN435995). In the phylogenetic tree, no clustering was observed with previously reported begomovirus strains isolated from J. curcas host. The strains isolated in this study belong to new begomoviral strain that elicits symptoms of leaf curling in J. curcas. The results indicate that the probable origin of the strains is from Jatropha mosaic virus infecting J. gassypifolia. The strains isolated in this study are referred as Jatropha curcas leaf curl India virus (JCLCIV) based on the major symptoms exhibited by host J. curcas.

AB Objective: Cyclosporine (CsA) is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 with a narrow therapeutic index and large individual difference. CYP3A4*1B is reported to be associated with CsA pharmacokinetics parameters, but the relevance is still in dispute. Therefore, a meta-analysis was employed to evaluate the influence of CYP3A4*1B on CsA pharmacokinetics at different post-transplantation times in adult renal transplant recipients.
   Methods: Studies on evaluating the CYP3A4*1B genotype and CsA pharmacokinetics were retrieved through a systematical search of relevant database including PubMed, Emabase, Web of science, the Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials.gov and three Chinese literature databases (up to 15 October 2017). The pharmacokinetic parameters: weight-adjusted CsA daily dose (Dose), cyclosporine trough concentration (C0) and trough concentration/weight-adjusted CsA daily dose ratio (C0/Dose ratio) were extracted, and all statistical analysis were performed by using Review Manager 5.1.0.
   Results: Four studies (involving 452 adult renal transplant recipients) were included in this meta-analysis. For the C0/Dose ratio, in all included renal transplant recipients, CYP3A4*1B carriers exhibited higher C0/Dose ratio than CYP3A4*1 (WMD 7.38, 95% CI 1.26-13.51; P = 0.02). The differences between CYP3A4*1B carriers and CYP3A4*1 in Dose (WMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.85-0.12; P = 0.14), Co (WMD 10.81, 95% CI 77.72-99.34; P = 0.81) were not statistically significant. According to post-transplantation time, subgroup analysis also showed no significant statistical significance between CYP3A4*1B carriers and CYP3A4*1 carriers in Dose or Co. However, this result should be further explored because only four studies were included.
   Conclusions: CYP3A4*1B is associated with CsA C0/Dose ratio in renal transplant recipients which indicates patients with CYP3A4*1B allele require lower dose of CsA to reach target blood concentration compared with the CYP3A4*1 carriers.

AB The aim of present study was to examine whether metformin in association with quercetin has any synergistically anti-tumor effects on prostate cancer. Our findings showed that metformin in combination with quercetin synergistically inhibited the growth, migration and invasion of both PC-3 and LNCaP cells. Co-treatment of these two agents induced more apoptosis than single agent treatment. The co-treatment-induced apoptosis was caspase-dependent and accompanied by the down-regulation of Bcl-2 family members. Our data also indicated that co-treatment of metformin and quercetin strongly inhibited the VEGF/Akt/PI3K pathway. Moreover, these two agents acted synergistically to repress the growth of human prostate cancer cell xenograft in vivo in nude mice. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the combination therapy of metformin and quercetin exerted synergistic antitumor effects in prostate cancers via inhibition of VEGF/Akt/PI3K pathway. Thus, combination treatment of metformin and quercetin would be a promising therapeutic strategy for prostate cancer patients.

AB Background: Liver fibrosis results from a wound healing response to chronic injury, which leads to excessive matrix deposition. Genome wide association studies have showen transcriptional dysregulation in mild and severe liver fibrosis. Recent studies suggested that genetic markers may be able to define the exact stage of liver fibrosis.
   Aim To define genes or genetic pathways that could serve as markers for staging or as therapeutic targets to halt progression of liver fibrosis.
   Methods: The study was performed on 105 treatment naive HCV genotype 4 infected patients [F0-F2, n = 56; F3-F4, n = 49] and 16 healthy subjects. The study included PCR array on 84 fibrosis related genes followed by customization of a smaller array consisting of 11 genes that were designed on the bases of results obtained from the larger array. Genes that displayed significant dysregulation at mRNA levels were validated at protein levels.
   Results and discussion: Two major pathways exhibited high dysregulation in early fibrosis as compared with controls or when compared with late fibrosis, these were the TGF beta - related pathway genes and Matrix - deposition associated genes. Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activators i.e. TGF beta pathway genes [TGF beta 1, 2 and 3, their receptors TGF beta R1 and 2, signaling molecules SMAD genes and PDGF growth factors] were considerably over expressed at transcriptional levels as early as F0, whereas expression of their inhibitor TGIF1 was simultaneously down regulated. Matrix proteins including collagen and MMPs were upregulated in early fibrosis whereas tissue inhibitors TIMPs 1 and 2 began over expression in late fibrosis. Expression at protein levels was concordant with RNA data excluding dysregulation at post transcriptional levels.
   Conclusion: Since these 2 gene sets are closely interrelated regarding HSC activation and proliferation, we assume that the current findings suggest that they are favorable targets to further search for stage specific markers.

AB Alu elements occupy 10% of the human genome. However, although they contribute to genomic and transcriptomic diversity, their function is still not fully understood. We hypothesized that intronic Alu elements may contribute to alternative splicing. We therefore examined their effect on splicing using minigene constructs including exon 9-exon 11 inclusive of ACAT1 with truncated introns 9 and 10. These constructs contained a suboptimal splice acceptor site for intron 9. Insertion of AIuY-partial AluSz6-AluSx, originally located in ACAT1 intron 5, in an antisense direction within intron 9 had a negative effect on exon 10 inclusion. This effect was additive with that of an exonic splicing enhancer mutation in exon 10, and was canceled by the substitution of G for Cat the first nucleotide of exon 10 which optimized the splice acceptor site of intron 9. A sense ALuY-partial AluSz6-AluSx insertion had no effect on exon 10 inclusion, and one antisense AluSx insertion had a similar effect to antisense AluY-partial AluSz6-AluSx insertion. The shorter the distance between the antisense Alu element and exon 10, the greater the negative effect on exon 10 inclusion. This distance effect was more evident for suboptimal than optimal splice sites. Based on our data, we propose that intronic antisense Alu elements contribute to alternative splicing and transcriptomic diversity in some genes, especially when splice acceptor sites are suboptimal.

AB Propofol, a widely used intravenous anesthetic, was previously considered as a neuroprotective agent. Recently, however, accumulating evidence suggests that it may cause neurotoxicity, especially in the development of neural stem cells (NSCs). The potential mechanisms contributing to propofol-induced neurotoxicity during neurogenesis, such as those involving microRNAs (miRNAs), are still unknown. In this study, a total of 27 differentially expressed miRNAs were identified in our initial screen and 6 miRNAs were validated by qRT-PCR. Three miRNAs were up-regulated (miR-377-5p, miR-194-3p and miR-143-5p), and three were down-regulated (miR-3583-3p, miR-466b-5p and miR-410-5p). Following gene ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, Gabbr1, Canca1b and Gabbr2, which are enriched in the GABAergic synapse pathway, were selected as genes potentially playing a role in propofol-induced neurotoxicity. Gabbr1 and Cacna1b, which are targeted by miRNAs that are up-regulated following propofol exposure, showed decreased expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Gabbr2, targeted by miRNAs that were down-regulated following treatment with propofol, was up-regulated at both the levels of mRNA and protein expression. The two clusters of miRNAs that show differential expression following propofol exposure may act in a synergistic manner to regulate several genes simultaneously during the development of NSCs. Our results may contribute to clarify the molecular mechanism and provide potential therapeutic targets for propofol induced neurotoxicity.

AB Daphnia pulex is an important food organism that exhibits a particular mode of reproduction known as cyclical parthenogenesis (asexual) and sexual reproduction. Regulation of the aging process by microRNAs (miRNAs) is a research hotspot in miRNA studies. To investigate a possible role of miRNAs in regulating aging and senescence, we used Illumina HiSeq to sequence two miRNA libraries from 1-day-old (1d) and 25-day-old (25d) D. pulex specimens. In total, we obtained 11,218,097 clean reads and 28,569 unique miRNAs from 1d specimens and 11,819,106 clean reads and 44,709 unique miRNAs from 25d specimens. Bioinformatic analyses was used to identify 1335 differentially expressed miRNAs from known miRNAs, including 127 miRNAs that exhibited statistically significant differences (P < 0.01); 92 miRNAs were upregulated and 35 were downregulated. Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR experiments were performed for nine miRNAs from five samples (1d, 5d, 10d, 15d, 20d and 25d) during the aging process, and the sequencing and qRT-PCR data were found to be consistent. Ninety-four miRNAs were predicted to correspond to 2014 target genes in known miRNAs with 4032 target gene sites. Sixteen pathways changed significantly (P < 0.05) at different developmental stages, revealing many important principles of the miRNA regulatory aging network of D. pulex. Overall, the difference in miRNA expression profile during aging of D. pulex forms a basis for further studies aimed at understanding the role of miRNAs in regulating aging, reproductive transformation, senescence, and longevity.

AB Fatty acids (FAs) constitute a considerable fraction of all lipid molecules with a fundamental role in numerous physiological processes. In animals, the majority of complex lipid molecules are derived from the transformation of FAs through several biochemical pathways. Yet, for FAs to enroll in these pathways they require an activation step. FA activation is catalyzed by the rate limiting action of Acyl-CoA synthases. Several Acyl-CoA enzyme families have been previously described and classified according to the chain length of FAs they process. Here, we address the evolutionary history of the ACSBG gene family which activates, FAs with > 16 carbons. Currently, two different ACSBG gene families, ACSBG1 and ACSBG2, are recognized in vertebrates. We provide evidence that a wider and unequal ACSBG gene repertoire is present in vertebrate lineages. We identify a novel ACSBG-like gene lineage which occurs specifically in amphibians, ray finned fishes, coelacanths and cartilaginous fishes named ACSBG3. Also, we show that the ACSBG2 gene lineage duplicated in the Theria ancestor. Our findings, thus offer a far richer understanding on FA activation in vertebrates and provide key insights into the relevance of comparative and functional analysis to perceive physiological differences, namely those related with lipid metabolic pathways.

SNPs rs10994336 and rs9804190 in ANK3 and rs1006737 in CACNA1C have emerged as the most highly replicated SNPs significantly associated with BD. The aim of the present study was to assess the association of these SNPs with BD in the Pakistani population, which has never before been examined. A total of 120 BD and 120 control individuals from Pakistan were examined in this analysis. Genotyping results indicated that rs1006737 in CACNA1C was significantly associated with BD, while rs10994336 or rs9804190 in ANK3 was not significant when examined individually. However, risk score assessment found that the presence of two or more risk alleles was significantly associated with disease, indicating that risk alleles from ANK3 and CACNA1C may additively contribute to BD. A protein-protein interaction network was generated using STRING to probe the relationship between ANK3 and CACNA1C interactors and their associations with BD. While none of the interactors are directly linked to BD, they play a role in pathways linked to BD, including oxytocin and dopamine signaling pathways. Collectively, these results reveal a significant association of CACNA1C with BD among the Pakistani population, extending results from other ethnic groups to the Pakistani population for the first time.

AB Objective: To analyze and preliminarily validate the lncRNA expression profiles in the stenosis tissue of arteriovenous fistula (AVF).
   Methods: A total of 54 uremic patients administered in the department of nephrology in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University between February 2017 and March 2017 were included in the study and subsequently categorized as experimental group, which included 12 patients with confirmed diagnosis of AVF, and control group which included 42 patients with no vascular stenosis. The experimental group inclusion criteria include: AVF used > 3 months; The blood flow of AVF < 200 mL/min; the degree of the stenosis was > 50%, excluded obvious thrombosis; The ultrasonographic data of AVF stenosis is complete. The controls were randomly selected from uremic patients who were primary AVF operation, excluded obvious vascular stenosis and vascular diseases. Among them, 4 sample in the experimental group and 4 controls were used in LncRNA sequencing. RNA in vascular tissue was extracted by Trizol and IncRNA sequencing was used to establish the expression profiles of lncRNA in the stenosis tissue of AVF.9 difference expression 1ncRNA were collected for validating in AVF stenosis cases by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRTPCR). Moreover, Cluster analysis, gene functional analysis and pathway analysis were used to explore the function of difference expression lncRNA.
   Results: Among the 27,692 lncRNA transcripts examined, 247 lncRNAs were found to be significantly differentially expressed (P < 0.05, fold change >= 2) in the experimental group and control group, with 141 being up regulated and 106 down-regulated. The expression levels of 9 lncRNAs validated by subsequent qRT-PCR were shown to be highly consistent with the sequencing data.
   Conclusion: Our study revealed lncRNAs expression profiles in the stenosis tissue of AVF by LncRNA sequencing. These lncRNAs and its related signaling pathways may play a key role in the occurrence and progression of AVF stenosis.

AB The MYH9 gene encodes the heavy chain of non-muscle myosin IIA, a widely expressed cytoplasmic myosin that participates in a variety of processes requiring the generation of intracellular chemomechanical force and translocation of the actin cytoskeleton. Non-muscle myosin IIA functions are regulated by phosphorylation of its 20 kDa light chain, of the heavy chain, and by interactions with other proteins. Variants of MYH9 cause an autosomal-dominant disorder, termed MYH9-related disease, and may be involved in other conditions, such at chronic kidney disease, non-syndromic deafness, and cancer. This review discusses the structure of the MYH9 gene and its protein, as well as the regulation and physiologic functions of non-muscle myosin IIA with particular reference to embryonic development. Moreover, the review focuses on current knowledge about the role of MYH9 variants in human disease.

AB Genetic variants at the interferon lambda (IFNL) locus have been associated with several human phenotypes in both disease and health. In chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, where the IFNL variants were first identified to be associated with response to interferon-alpha-ribavirin therapy, the available data clearly suggests that the causal variant could be the dinucleotide polymorphism rs368234815 that causes an open reading frame shift in the IFNL4 gene resulting in expression of a functional IFN-lambda 4, a new type III IFN. In other human diseases/phenotypes where IFNL variants have been recently associated with, the causal mechanism remains unclear. In vitro evidence has shown that other IFNL variants (rs28416813, rs4803217) may regulate expression of another type III IFN, IFN-lambda 3. Therefore, expression of a functional IFN-lambda 4 and quantitative differences in IFN- lambda 3 expression are two potential causal mechanisms behind the observed phenotypes. Since these two potential causal mechanisms involve features of mutual exclusivity and overlapping functions, it is difficult to differentiate one from the other, in vivo, in absence of other implicating evidences. In addition, the strong linkage disiequilibrium (LD) observed in many populations at the IFNL locus makes it difficult to tease out the actual functional/causal variants responsible for the phenotypes. The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisal rs117648444 that alters the activity of IFN-lambda 4 and the LD structure in the IFNL region which leads to a confounding effect of rs117648444 on other IFNL variants, provide us with additional tools in case-control studies to probe the role of IFN-lambda 4.

AB Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a common skeletal disorder whereby genetic factors play a role in etiology. Multiple genes have been reported to be associated with the occurrence of DDH. WISP3 gene was found to be a causative gene for progressive pseudorheumatoid dysplasia (PPD). Reports of WISP3 gene in association with DDH are lacking. We conducted a case-control candidate gene association study enrolling three hundred and eighty-six patients with radiology confirmed DDH and 558 healthy controls. Additional haplotype-analysis was conducted to find the significant haplotype for DDH. Five SNPs rs69306665 (upstream of WISP3), rs1022313 (WISP3), rs1230345 (WISP3), rs17073268 (WISP3) and rs10456877 (downstream of WISP3) were identified for association with DDH, showing significant difference of allele frequencies with similar odds ratio ranging from 0.71 to 0.77 (p < 0.01) between cases and controls. Two haplotypes were identified between cases and controls through haplotype analysis: AAAAA with an odds ratio of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.60-0.98, p = 0.032299) and GGCGG with an odds ratio of 1.67 (95% CI: 1.37-2.04, p = 3.67 * 10(-7)). The results suggested WISP3 gene was associated with DDH in Chinese Han population. GGCGG haplotype might be a biomarker for DDH.

AB L-phenylglycine is a rare non-proteinogenic amino acid, which only occurs in a few natural compounds, such as the streptogramin antibiotics pristinamycin I and virginiamycin S or the bicyclic peptide antibiotic dityromycin. Here we report on the biochemical characterization of the aminotransferase PglE that catalyzes the transamination from phenylglyoxylate to L-phenylglycine, which represents the final reaction step during phenylglycine biosynthesis. Enzyme assays with the purified PglE enzyme revealed that L-phenylalanine is used as an amino group donor for the transamination reaction, leading to the formation of phenylpyruvate, which may re-enter phenylglycine biosynthesis as a precursor. Based on these results, we postulate a novel L-phenylglycine biosynthetic pathway.

AB Furfural and HMF are known for a negative impact in different bioprocesses, including lactic acid fermentation. There are already some methods described to remove these inhibitory compounds from the hydrolysates. However, these methods also reduce the yield of sugars from the hydrolysis and increase the process costs. In this work, the detoxification of sugarcane-derived hemicellulosic hydrolysate was performed by Lactobacillus plantarum during the fermentation time. At the end of the fermentation, a decrease of 98% of furfural and 86% of HMF and was observed, with a final lactic acid titer of 34.5 g/L. The simultaneous fermentation and bio-detoxification simplify the process and reduce operational costs, leading to economic competitiveness of second-generation feedstock for lactic acid production.

AB Gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) is an important bio-product used in pharmaceuticals, functional foods, and a precursor of the biodegradable plastic polyamide 4 (Nylon 4). Glutamate decarboxylase B (GadB) from Escherichia. coli is a highly active biocatalyst that can convert L-glutamate to GABA. However, its practical application is limited by the poor thermostability and only active under acidic conditions of GadB. In this study, we performed site-directed saturation mutagenesis of the N-terminal residues of GadB from Escherichia coli to improve its thermostability. A triple mutant (M6, Gln5Ile/Val6Asp/Thr7Gln) showed higher thermostability, with a 5.6 times (560%) increase in half-life value at 45 degrees C, 8.7 degrees C rise in melting temperature (Tm) and a 14.3 degrees C rise in the temperature at which 50% of the initial activity remained after 15 min incubation (T-50(15)), compared to wild-type enzyme. Protein 3D structure analysis showed that the induced new hydrogen bonds in the same polypeptide chain or between polypeptide chains in E. coli GadB homo-hexamer may be responsible for the improved thermostability. Increased thermostability contributed to increased GABA conversion ability. After 12 h conversion of 3 mol/L L-glutamate, GABA produced and mole conversion rate catalyzed by M6 whole cells was 297 g/L and 95%, respectively, while those by wild-type GAD was 273.5 g/L and 86.2%, respectively.

AB Microbial immobilization can be used to prepare encapsulated inoculants. Here, we characterize and describe the preparation of Ca-alginate-perlite microbeads loaded with cells of plant growth-promoting Pseudomonas putida A (ATCC 12633), for their future application as agricultural inoculants. The microbeads were prepared by dropwise addition of a CaCl2-paraffin emulsion mixture to an emulsion containing alginate 2% (w/v), perlite 0.1-0.4% (w/v) and bacterial suspension in 0.9% NaCl (10(10) CFU/mL). For all perlite concentrations used, microbead size was 90-120 mu m, the trapped population was 10(8) CFU/g microbeads and the increase in mechanical stability was proportional to perlite concentration. Microbeads containing 0.4% (w/v) perlite were able to release bacteria into the medium after 30 days of incubation. When we evaluated how P. putida A (ATCC 12633) entrapped in Ca-alginate-perlite (0.4% (w/v)) microbeads colonized the Arabidopsis thaliana rhizosphere, an increase in colonization over time was detected (from an initial 2.1x10(4) to 9.2x10(5) CFU/g soil after 21 days). With this treatment, growth promotion of A. thaliana occurred with an increase in the amount of proteins, and in root and leaf biomass. It was concluded that the microbeads could be applied as possible inoculants, since they provide protection and a controlled release of microorganisms into the rhizosphere.

AB Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) form a rapidly growing class of biopharmaceuticals which attracts a lot of attention throughout the industry due to its high potential for cancer therapy. They combine the specificity of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) and the cell-killing capacity of highly cytotoxic small molecule drugs. Site-specific conjugation approaches involve a multi-step process for covalent linkage of antibody and drug via a linker. Despite the range of parameters that have to be investigated, high-throughput methods are scarcely used so far in ADC development.
   In this work an automated high-throughput platform for a site-specific multi-step conjugation process on a liquid-handling station is presented by use of a model conjugation system. A high-throughput solid-phase buffer exchange was successfully incorporated for reagent removal by utilization of a batch cation exchange step. To ensure accurate screening of conjugation parameters, an intermediate UV/Vis-based concentration determination was established including feedback to the process. For conjugate characterization, a high-throughput compatible reversed-phase chromatography method with a runtime of 7 min and no sample preparation was developed. Two case studies illustrate the efficient use for mapping the operating space of a conjugation process. Due to the degree of automation and parallelization, the platform is capable of significantly reducing process development efforts and material demands and shorten development timelines for antibody-drug conjugates.

AB Annual influenza vaccination campaigns emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated against influenza. These campaigns offer potential opportunities to raise awareness of all vaccines. We explored the peak timing of the receipt of influenza and other routinely recommended vaccinations.
   We examined administrative claims data of 31 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, eligible to receive vaccinations administered from 2013 to 2015 from Medicare Part B (medical insurance) and Medicare Part D (prescription drug benefit).
   From 2013 to 2015, 88% of over 50 million influenza vaccination claims occurred in September, October, and November. Claims for pneumococcal (42%), herpes zoster (36%), and tetanus-containing (32%) vaccines were also concentrated during these months. For pneumococcal vaccines, this concentration occurred across various provider settings, including traditional doctor's offices, pharmacies, and hospitals. Herpes zoster (92%) and tetanus-containing (72%) vaccines were largely administered in the pharmacy.
   Annual influenza vaccination efforts offer additional opportunities to assess, recommend, and administer other recommended vaccinations. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
