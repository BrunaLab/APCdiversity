ID DISCHARGE; STAGE
AB Accurate forecast stages at river sections is of paramount importance to properly address Flood Forecasting and Warning Systems (FFWSs) operating in real-time. The forecast values can be provided by flood wave routing models to be implemented when gauged sections are operative along the channel. Different models have been proposed in the literature and the forecast can be approached by neglecting or involving the contribution of lateral inflows. Among the latter, recently STAFOM-RCM (STAge FOrecasting Model-Rating Curve Model) has been proposed assuming a lateral contribution uniformly distributed along the reach. Therefore, the model application is not suitable for future stage prediction at hydrometric sections located just downstream river confluences. To overcome this issue, we propose a methodology that exploits the probabilistic forecast estimated at a gauged site on a tributary through a Bayesian approach and the probabilistic relationship between the stages recorded here and the ones at a downstream site located along the main channel, where the forecasted stage estimate is of interest.
   The Paglia River basin, in central Italy, is selected as case study. The results indicate that the procedure can be useful to address real-time hydraulic risk management even at river sections located downstream important confluences, provided that gauged sites are operative along the tributary.

   AMAZONIA; SOIL; PASTURE; EROSION
AB Decades of logging and slash-and-burn agriculture have turned vast tracts of land in tropical South-east Asia into unproductive fire-climax grasslands whose hydrological functioning is poorly known. To help fill this knowledge gap, a 3.2 ha landslide-affected Imperata grassland micro-catchment with perennial flow on Leyte Island (Philippines) was instrumented and monitored for a year. The area was hit by typhoon Haiyan on 8 November 2013, one of the largest events on record. Landslide surfaces covered 3.4% of the catchment prior to typhoon Haiyan and contributed to 'direct runoff' (Q(q)). This basic 'contributing area' increased to 7.7% by activation of old landslides and formation of new ones during typhoon Haiyan. Median storm runoff coefficients (Q(q)/P) based on straight-line hydrograph separation were 9% and 23% before (48 events) and after the typhoon (43 events), respectively, but the ratios of period-total Q(q) and P were much larger (24% and 47%, respectively). Both storm runoff volumes and peak discharge increased rapidly once a mid-slope water storage threshold for the upper 60 cm of soil of 250 mm was exceeded. Storm runoff contributions above those generated on landslides were most likely in the form of overland flow given the prevailing very low soil hydraulic conductivities. Post-typhoon water use of the heavily disturbed vegetation was reduced initially by nearly 70%, recovering to nearly 80% of the pre-typhoon value after similar to 3 months. The high annual sediment yield (similar to 27 t ha(-1)) was heavily dominated by post-Haiyan sediment transport (94%); bedload contributed similar to 8% of the total sediment yield.

AB Radioactive pollutants enter the subsurface hydrology environment commonly because of operation or accidental leakage from nuclear sites. In some occasions, heterogeneity in the groundwater system controls the fate of water transport in the aquifer; it determines how contaminated groundwater change at site boundary. Assumption of uniform and homogeneous conditions in subsurface hydrology will lead to unpredictable errors in the decision when initiating a protection program for groundwater. This study presents a novel process to establish a practical procedure of reliability and risk assessment for a Quaternary aquifer relating to hypothetical nuclear facility installed on the ground surface. This research performs reliability and risk analysis considering specified limit as resistance and in situ groundwater condition as load; it shows a safety state of the studied site regarding the records of radioactivity in the aquifer. It demonstrates a novel result of groundwater at different observation locations and natural environment discharge point associated to reliability issue, and represents recommendation for the use of groundwater or environmental monitoring as safety protection of the studied site.

AB Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) cause environmental problems and health risks, but poor guidance exists on the use of rainfall data for sizing optimal CSO control solutions. This study first reviews available types of rainfall information as input for CSO modelling and, secondly, assesses the impacts of three rainfall data selection methods (continuous simulation, historical rainstorms selected based on rainfall depth or maximum intensity and IDF-derived storms) on the estimation of CSO volume thresholds to control in order to reach specific seasonal CSO frequency targets. The methodology involves hydrological/hydraulic modelling of an urban catchment in the Province of Quebec (Canada). Continuous simulation provides the most accurate volume estimations and shows high sensitivity to the number of simulated years. Alternatively, when historical events extracted from rainfall data separated by a minimum inter-event time (MIT) criterion are selected based on their total rainstorm depth, the CSO volumes are underestimated significantly; whereas an analysis based on rainstorm maximum intensities over durations similar to the time of concentration provides more conservative volumes. Finally, synthetic storms constructed from multiple points of an IDF curve tend to underestimate slightly the CSO volumes, but provide acceptable results compared to single point derived storms. It was found that the overflow structures local characteristics had a marginal influence on results obtained from continuous simulation compared to event-based simulation. The use of design rainfall events should thus be restricted to preliminary assessment of CSO volume thresholds, and the final volume estimation for solution sizing should be reviewed under continuous simulation. The innovative contribution lies in the improvement of modelling procedures for solutions design to achieve a maximum CSO frequency, such as specified by many regulating agencies.

AB The macroscopic effects of soil textural heterogeneity and fine-scale soil layering on unsaturated flow remain poorly understood. In this study we used the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to numerically generate artificial particle packings of heterogeneous sands from which the pore structure can be extracted. Packings were generated from known grain size distributions following sand grain mixing and fine-scale profile layering. Five sands with different mean grain sizes were used to investigate the effects of heterogeneity on their pore structure, including changes in the permeability and soil water retention (SWR). Heterogeneous media were created by mixing a relatively fine sand with coarser sands. In addition, we created layered media having sharp as well as transitional interfaces between the two sand samples. Mixing fine and coarse sand caused reductions in the average pore body and pore throat sizes of the coarser sands, and hence also in their intrinsic permeability. The layered media with a transitional interface showed lower porosities at the interface because of penetration of small particles into the larger pores, while the porosities increased at sharp interfaces. The nonlinear relationships between permeability and the average pore body and throat radii were explored using different unimodal sands. Mixing fine and coarse sand caused a decrease in the capillary pressure at a given water content of the new medium, and hence larger values of the van Genuchten a parameter. The SWRCs of the layered soils with a sharp interface were best described using bimodal functions. Sharp interfaces caused a non-monotonic change in the drainage curve due to discrepancies between the pore throat radii of the two adjacent sands. This change was influenced by d(50) of the sands used for the layered media. In contrast to the sharp interface, a monotonic (smooth) change in the drainage curve was observed for two sands having small differences in their d(50) values. The study gave considerable insight into how particle heterogeneity and layering affects the hydraulic properties of unsaturated media.

DE Groundwater; Energy subsidies; Common property; Optimal behavior
ID MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEMS
AB The present paper studies the effects of alternative modifications of a subsidy for electricity used to pump groundwater on the behavior of profit maximizing groundwater users. It proposes a stylized model for groundwater extraction, and then numerically derives general results by simulation. The model is applied to aquifers in Leon, Guanajuato, Mexico and Kern County, California. The performance of two traditional policy intervention measures-subsidy elimination and reduction-are compared to a new, innovative modification policy, namely, decoupling the subsidy from the electricity bill; this policy is arguably more politically acceptable. The results of extensive simulations suggest that the rate of aquifer water extraction, and the consequent level of water in the aquifer, can be improved significantly by changing the subsidy structure.

AB In tropical karstic regions, knowledge about the timing and quantity of land-ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes is important, as those nutrients may affect sensitive coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs. High permeability of karst aquifers, combined with high discharge during heavy rain events, lead to a close connectivity between groundwater in the hinterland and the coastal zone. Alteration between dry and wet periods can lead to a temporal variability of groundwater discharge volume and its associated nutrient fluxes. We studied the seasonal variability of land-ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes in the tropical karstic region of Gunung Kidul (southern Java, Indonesia) from November 2015 to December 2016. Satellite thermal infrared imagery revealed two major areas of direct submarine and coastal groundwater discharge. Nutrient fluxes were estimated at the largest coastal spring using a discharge dataset from a subsurface river dam and a monthly record of nutrient concentrations sampled from the spring. Nitrate fluxes ranged from 6 x 10(6)-245 x 10(6) mol/day, dissolved silicon fluxes from 58 x 10(6)-546 x 10(6) mol/day and phosphate fluxes from 17 x 10(3)-1571 x 10(3) mol/day. Nutrient fluxes are mostly controlled by discharge and show a high variability through time. Extraordinarily high nitrate and phosphate fluxes were observed after a period of constant and heavy rain. Most likely a nutrient pool in the top soil in the hinterland from untreated sewage or fertilizer is flushed during rain events through the aquifer to the coast. In tropical karstic regions sudden inputs of large amounts of nutrients via groundwater discharge may affect coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs making them especially vulnerable during high discharge events.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Precipitation; Asymmetric dependence; Empirical copula
ID GENERATION MODEL; RAINFALL FIELDS; SIMULATION; SINGAPORE; COEFFICIENT
AB Precipitation plays an important role in any hydrological analysis. The aim of this study is to empirically investigate the behaviour of spatial dependence of precipitation fields. This would determine whether the Gaussian assumption is fulfilled in regard to symmetric spatial dependence structure between low and high precipitation values. An asymmetry function that can incorporate zero precipitation amounts is introduced on the basis of empirical bivariate copulas. The asymmetry function is calculated by integrating the empirical bivariate copula density in the upper right and the lower left parts for any given quantile thresholds. Zero precipitation amounts are handled as latent variables and the thresholds, therefore, are set to be bigger than probability of zero. The Gaussian simulations based testing is applied for determining the degree of uncertainty. The empirical bivariate copulas are constructed using the concept of regionalized variables in spatial random process with a given separating distance. For any selected time interval, the precipitation over the region of interest is assumed to be a single realization of a spatially stationary random process. The investigations are conducted in Singapore and Bavaria. To take temporal characteristics and seasons into account, precipitation occurrences with different time scales for different seasons are analysed.
   The empirical evidence proves that the precipitation events tend to follow the positive asymmetric spatial dependence structure, particularly at a short separating distance. This implies that precipitation amounts with higher intensities tends to be more spatially correlated than that with lower intensities because precipitation occurrences tend to occur in a clustered manner. Consequently, spatial precipitation models that are based on the symmetric Gaussian dependence could result in an underestimation of the spatial extent of actual precipitation extremes. Moreover, this pattern is higher for smaller time scales (hourly to daily).

AB Surrogate-assisted simulation-optimization technique is an effective approach for identifying aquifer remediation strategies. Using surrogate models to replace high-fidelity groundwater simulation models is key to reduce computing time. Inevitably, uncertainties persist in surrogate model structure and parameters and may lead to poor accuracy in prediction. However, past studies often adopt one surrogate to capture the original model response and rarely investigate uncertainties and approximation accuracy of surrogate models. In this study, we present an ensemble surrogate modeling approach to address uncertainty in surrogate model predictions for saltwater intrusion mitigation designs using a hypothetical horizontal scavenger well. Firstly, polynomial response surface surrogate models are constructed to capture the relationship between chloride concentrations and saltwater extraction rates of a horizontal well. Secondly, a stochastic optimization model that includes multiple ensemble surrogates is developed to determine the optimal saltwater extraction schedule. Chance-constrained (CC) programming is used to account for model selection uncertainty in probabilistic nonlinear concentration constraints. Akaike information criterion correction (AICc) based Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method is adopted to determine required statistics of concentrations in the chance constraints. Finally, a set of saltwater intrusion mitigation strategies are obtained through an interior point optimization algorithm. The proposed methodology is applied to the saltwater intrusion problem in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. A high-fidelity flow and solute transport model is developed, but requires 16 h for one model run. The study shows that the developed surrogate models perform well and have strong predictive capabilities with respect to the solute transport model response, while considerably reducing computation time. Including model selection uncertainty through multimodel inference and model averaging provides more reliable remediation strategies compared with the single surrogate assisted approach.

AB Areal reduction factors (ARFs) transform an estimate of extreme rainfall at a point to an estimate of extreme rainfall over a spatial domain, and are commonly used in flood risk estimation. For applications such as the design of large infrastructure, dam safety and land use planning, ARFs are needed to estimate flood risk for very rare events that are often larger than the biggest historical events. The nature of the relationship between ARFs and frequency for long return periods is unclear as it depends on the asymptotic dependence structure of rainfall over a region, i.e., the extent to which rainfall from a surrounding region is extreme as rainfall at a point becomes more extreme. Miscalculating this for very rare events could lead to poor design of infrastructure. To investigate this, spatial rainfall processes are simulated using asymptotically dependent and independent models, and the implications for ARFs of the asymptotic assumptions are explored in a synthetic study. The models are then applied to a case study in Victoria, Australia, using 88 daily rainfall gauges with 50 years of data. The analysis shows that the observed data follow the behaviour of an asymptotically independent process, leading to ARFs that decrease with increasing return period. The study demonstrates that the use of inverted max-stable process models to simulate ARFs can provide a rigorous alternative to empirical approaches, particularly for long return periods requiring significant extrapolation from the data.

AB Short-term prediction of hydrological time series using chaotic dynamical systems approach has gained popularity. However, noise can severely affect the prediction accuracy of any data driven modelling approach. Noise reduction processes attempted in chaotic hydrological time series analysis were later questioned by Elshorbagy et al. (2002) for their appropriateness for noise reduction processes. Only a few studies on noise reduction have appeared since then, and these too were limited to introducing new noise reduction methods.
   Most of the past studies on chaotic time series noise reduction shared a general perception that the noise reduced data trained models can give better predictions; they used off line noise reduction methods to obtain a 'noise reduced data set' which was then used to make prediction models. However, the results of this study showed that this was not necessarily true and often flawed, when the input data was noisier. Instead, noise reduced data inputs, were shown to yield higher prediction accuracy even with noisy data trained models. Thus, the study showed a real need to use real-time noise reduction methods instead of off-line noise reduction methods that had previously been used.
   The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), a popular nonlinear state estimation method from controls literature, was introduced as a real-time noise reduction method and its effectiveness was demonstrated on both synthetic chaotic time series and real river flow time series. EKF produced prediction improvement as high as 15%-40% on the benchmark time series with noise levels varying from 1% to 30%. Two river flow series, with low average flows, showed prediction improvement whereas three other flow series, with relatively large average flows, did not. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models were used as the state-space models in EKF, and adopting them to time delays different from 1 unit was also demonstrated. The study demonstrated an 'indirect' validation method to verify the effectiveness of noise reduction when several interrelated time series were available; this was supported in observed discharge time series of the Ciliwung River in Jakarta, Indonesia.

   RESPONSES; DRY; PRECIPITATION
AB Plant water use is an important component in the function of Earth's critical zone and this can be examined by decomposing isotope composition of xylem water into contributions from precipitation stored in shallow soil layers and deeper groundwater. The usual procedure for estimating the proportional use of groundwater by plants is to sample the isotope composition of soil and groundwater and determine the most probable mixing coefficients from all potential sources. Here we propose and test a novel method for achieving the same goal without sampling soil water. The method is based on analyzing variability in the stem water isotope ratios of several members of a community and the known isotope ratio of groundwater to 'triangulate' the unknown isotope ratio of stored rainwater. Using a simple water balance model, parameterized to produce the best fit between actual and estimated stem water isotope ratios, we simulated seasonal variation in the volume and isotope ratio of rainwater storage, along with species-specific groundwater use ratios. The method was applied to eight woody plant species growing on two rocky outcrops in the South China karst. Estimated average proportional groundwater use over two seasons varied between 14% and 62% and was site-dependent. For the majority of species, groundwater use increased as estimated stored rainwater volume declined. The two species with highest groundwater use were taller, deciduous or semi-deciduous trees with lower wood densities. While the new method was inspired by the inability to sample water stored in the rocky outcrops, it may have broader use in any environment where the spatial variability of soil water isotope composition is a barrier to estimating average groundwater use ratios. The broader adoption of this or equivalent methods would greatly improve the study of the Earth's critical zone.

AB In this work, we conducted two laboratory column experiments on an undisturbed sandy soil. The first deals with a percolation-drainage experiment whereas the second deals with an infiltration of a constant water flux at the surface of the unsaturated soil. A Bayesian assessment of the soil parameters is performed for both experiments with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method using measurements of pressure head inside the column and cumulative outflow collected during the experiments. The results show that both experiments can be well reproduced with the mathematical model based on the Richards equation and the van-Genchten/Mualem models. Furthermore, the inversion of the two laboratory experiments yields similar results in terms of mean estimated parameter values but strong discrepancies occur between confidence intervals used to quantify uncertainty on the estimated parameters. Compared to the percolation-drainage experiment, the infiltration experiment yields more accurate parameters with narrower uncertainty regions.

AB Operative distributed/semi-distributed rainfall-runoff formulations need a mathematically tractable component for estimating the expected areal-average infiltration rate,  I , while point infiltration models are usually adopted for this purpose. A model for  I , suitable for hydrological applications, was proposed by Morbidelli et al. (2006, Hydrological Processes, 20: 1465-1481). The main model tenet is the use of cumulative infiltration as an independent variable and replacement of time by its expected value. While this model- as with many other models for field-scale infiltration- was tested through Monte Carlo methods, it remains untested with experimental observations. In this study, a reassessment of the model's applicability is conducted through experimental evidence from several rainfall-runoff events observed under natural conditions at the plot scale over a slight slope characterized by a silty loam soil. During each experiment rainfall rate, surface runoff at the plot outlet and soil water content vertical profiles were monitored at short time intervals. An overall analysis of our results suggests that the model reliably simulates  I  and surface runoff as functions of time and is also suitable for applications under time-dependent rainfall events. The process of redistribution under rainfall hiatus is not addressed by this model.

AB During the complex dynamic interactions between rainfall and basin properties, different portions of the basin produce runoff at different moments. Capturing this spatiotemporal variability is important for flood analysis, but knowledge of this subject is limited. The presented research aims at improving the understanding of runoff contributing areas (RCA; hillslope sections from which water flows, reaches the stream network, and consequently the basin outlet) and at examining their relationship with the magnitude of a flash flood's peak discharge. A distributed hydrological model (GB-HYDRA) that enables computing RCA and flood discharge was developed. The model was applied to four medium-size basins (18-69 km(2)) in a Mediterranean climate and 59 flash flood events were analyzed. The correlation between basin input flux (basin area multiplied by the basin maximal rain intensity averaged over the time of concentration) and output flux (observed peak discharge) was poor (R-2 = 0.16). However, using a newly developed index, termed IRCA, to calculate the input flux accounting only for the RCA extent and rainfall intensity over it, resulted in a substantially higher correlation (R-2 = 0.64) across a wide range of flood magnitudes. The highest correlation was found using a 50-min time window, which is shorter than the time of concentration. Flood events were categorized according to their magnitude and the differences of several factors among the groups were examined. Pre-storm soil moisture content was found to be similar for all event magnitudes; however, pre-peak soil moisture content was substantially different between moderate and large extreme events. Other important properties that differed between magnitudes were: RCA extent and its averaged rain intensity and ratio of convective rainfall. Finally, areas with land-uses characterized by low runoff potential became dominant and contributed mainly during large and extreme events. Although the RCA and its extent full potential is yet to be fulfilled, it is proposed as a significant tool for understanding processes of flash flood generation at the basin scale in future research.

Groundwater level (GWL) variations of the studied site (a 17 km(2) topographic hill located in Burgundy, France) are monitored hourly through 18 boreholes, 3 karstic resurgences and the outlet river discharge of the catchment basin (40 km2). The Gerke and Van Genuchten double porosity model is implemented in the METIS code and used to simulate GWL variations with a matrix and a fracture medium. Model parameters are calibrated by fitting a simulated fracture medium GWL to measured GWL for four boreholes that are representative of the topographic hill hydrodynamics. The double medium approach succeeds in reproducing measured fast GWL responses, after recharge events that are not reproduced by a single medium approach. Investigating the model parameters' impact on simulated GWL variations and the exchange flow between the two media allows the conceptualization of the physical structure and the hydrodynamic mechanisms of the fissured karst aquifer. The spatial organization of parameters is observed and indicates areas of higher fracture density producing rapid GWL responses in contrast to lower fracture density areas, which produce slower and higher GWL responses. The fracture medium hydraulic parameters and the exchange parameter controlling the matrix/fracture interface properties are the most influential parameters for the simulated fracture medium GWL and the exchange flow between the matrix and the fracture medium during a recharge event. Calibrated fracture medium hydraulic conductivity and effective porosity vary respectively from 6.3E to 05 m.s(-1) and 0.3% to 3.2E-04 m.s(-1) and 2.4%, and the exchange parameter varies from 2.9E-10 m(-1).s(-1) to 6.5E-10 m(-1).s(-1). Matrix medium hydraulic conductivity variations have little impact on the simulation results while matrix medium effective porosity affects slightly simulated GWL, values vary from 11% to 17%. Finally, this study shows the Gerke and Van Genuchten double porous medium validity for the simulation of groundwater level in a fissured karst aquifer.

AB The Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS) model was used to derive estimates of suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) and suspended-sediment load (SSL), their dependence on discharge, and their trends with confidence intervals, for one site each on the lowermost Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers. The WRTDS model reduces uncertainty in SSCs related to variable streamflow conditions. Flow-normalized SSCs in each river were similar, and decreased from about 260 mg/L to 130 mg/L from 1980 through 2015; combined annual SSL in the two rivers decreased from about 200 Megatons per year (MT/y) to about 100 MT/y. Declines in SSC and SSL were more gradual from 2005 through 2015 and show signs of stabilizing. Our estimates of SSL in 2015 differ markedly from several recently published estimates of current and projected future Mississippi River SSLs, which were generally around 200 MT/y. However, these values came mostly from a different site upstream on the Mississippi River. The relationship between SSC and streamflow differed in an important way between the two rivers. SSC increased as streamflow increased for the entire range of observed streamflow in the Atchafalaya River. In the Mississippi River, SSC followed the same pattern during low and moderate streamflow but decreased at the highest streamflow that tended to occur between January and July. Since much of the water flowing in the Atchafalaya originates from the Mississippi River, the difference suggests a within-basin source of suspended sediment for the Atchafalaya River that is absent in the lower Mississippi River. These findings have important implications for the restoration of deltaic wetlands in coastal Louisiana. Accurate estimates of the SSL available in each river are crucial for understanding how effective diversions of river water into adjacent estuaries will be in sustaining these wetlands. Our study demonstrates that there might be far less sediment available than previously reported. Further, the difference in the relationship between SSC and streamflow in the two rivers is highly relevant to the ongoing discussion of coastal restoration strategies because the delta building that is occurring at the mouth of the Atchafalaya River is frequently used as a model of what could be expected with controlled diversions in the lower Mississippi River delta. The differences in the SSC behavior with changes in streamflow between the two rivers needs to be considered when results from the Atchafalaya River system are projected to those of the Mississippi River.

AB Downscaling is the process by which output from global climate models is translated to finer resolution regional scale projections often used in impact studies. Many fundamentally different techniques can be used, each with different capabilities of resolving or representing sub-gridscale processes. The different formulations can lead to variations in the downscaled output with consequential impacts in the interpretation of future change. Here, future runoff is estimated for six catchments in the Australian state of Victoria using five different regional rainfall projection products. We investigate how differences in rainfall input manifest in a selection of regionally important hydroclimate metrics. Overall, annual runoff is projected to decline under most methods, but seasonal changes are more uncertain reflecting differences in the rainfall change signal for different downscaled products. Whilst change in flow metrics are mostly consistent with rainfall change factors, changes in low flow (e.g. 7-day minimum flow) show considerable uncertainty, especially for drier, ephemeral catchments. Results from empirical (simple) scaling of climate observations generally lie within the range of more complex downscaling methods. However, empirical scaling is unable to provide meaningful information on spatial heterogeneity in the change signals, as well as for several metrics of rainfall and runoff. Other downscaling methods can potentially provide information on these, but the large uncertainty remains a problem, as well as our currently poor understanding of method-related biases.

AB This study presents a new approach for complex networks-based analysis of temporal streamflow dynamics. The novelty comes in the form of using nonlinear dynamic concepts to construct the temporal streamflow network. The approach involves three steps. First, the single-variable streamflow time series is represented in a multidimensional phase space using delay embedding, i.e. phase space reconstruction. Next, this reconstructed phase space is treated as a network, with the reconstructed vectors (instead of the streamflow values themselves) serving as the nodes and the connections between them serving as the links. Finally, the strength of each node in the network is determined using a distance metric. The approach is employed independently to monthly streamflow time series observed over a period of 53 years (January 1950-December 2002) from each of 639 stations in the contiguous United States. For each time series, different delay time values for phase space reconstruction are considered and the optimum embedding dimension is determined using the false nearest neighbor (FNN) method. The results indicate the usefulness of the phase space reconstruction-based network construction for examining the temporal connections in streamflow. The distribution of the strengths of nodes for any streamflow network is used to identify the type of the underlying network. The average node strength of each of the 639 streamflow networks are also interpreted: (1) to identify similarities and differences between the stations; (2) to explain the role of catchment and flow properties (drainage area, elevation, and flow mean) on network strength; and (3) to assess the influence of time (i.e. month of the year) on network strength.

AB Given the high cost of data acquisition in soil water problems, it is becoming increasingly essential to collect the measurements as cost-efficient as possible. By introducing the data-worth analysis framework coupled with Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), this real-world case study attempts to assess the worth of potential soil moisture observations before data collection. A field experiment was implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of quantifying the effect of future data on uncertainty reduction under real circumstances in a sequential way. The data worth of future observations is defined regarding soil hydraulic parameter estimation or soil moisture profile retrieval. Four information measures, including the trace (T-r), Shannon entropy difference (SD), relative entropy (RE) and degrees of freedom for signal (DFS), are introduced to quantify the information content. The sequential data worth analysis framework is examined by a number of cases, including under different irrigation intensities, with different prior data (existing observations that have already been collected), and with data of various depths and different measurement errors. We demonstrated the ability, and the challenge as well, of quantifying the data worth sequentially. Our results showed that data worth assessment regarding soil moisture profile retrieval is more difficult than that regarding parameter identification. Variance-type and covariance-type metrics have relatively loose accuracy requirement on potential observations (future possible observations to be collected), while mean-covariance-type metrics require higher accuracy. The vertical covariance of soil moisture is susceptible to the effect of atmospheric boundary condition, which eventually imposes a challenge on the quantification of data worth with covariance involved indices. The match between the expected and reference data worth can be improved by assimilating more prior data. However, more prior data cannot compensate for the damage from possible model structural error due to the changed scenarios between the prior stage and the posterior or preposterior stage. Shallow soil moisture data generally has larger data worth than deep observations in our study, but evaluating data worth with shallow data is subject to considerable uncertainty if covariance-type or mean-covariance-type index is employed. Smaller measurement error does not always lead to improved data worth estimation.

AB The objective of this research is to improve the understanding and recognition of the management challenges to flash flooding hazards and the potential adaptive measures within the arid urban areas through a socio-hydrological framework. Considering the capital of Sudan, Khartoum, as an example of urban arid areas with increasing flash flood risk, the analysis was founded on expert views and opinions collected from a range of different flood management actors following the 2013 and 2014 flash flood events. The qualitative research methods included participant observation, expert interviews and focus groups. The main themes of management challenges recorded included weak institutional capacity, bad governance, limited resources, and poor urban planning. These four themes, in turn, included different types of challenges, among which lack of: civil society engagement and coordination of actors, political will, data and tools, and effective urban development strategy shared the highest number of comments from the professional actors in each theme, respectively. These findings presented a management perspective to the lessons previously established and learned from an impact assessment. Accordingly, the amalgamation of all the lessons learned from the flood research findings enabled a suitable Master Flash Flood Management Plan (MaFFMaP) to be proposed as a final product. This plan would operate within an Integrated Flash Flood Management (IFFM) framework. The facets of the MaFFMaP include steps toward improving the quantity and quality of data resources regarding this hazard, aspects for use of these new datasets within a mixed-measure (structural and non-structural) approach from the authorities, and programmes for building community and civil society capacity through improving awareness and engagement. Furthermore, it is intended that this plan would be a replicable design, which could therefore be adopted and implemented in the wider context of the urban arid regions.

ID ATOLL ISLANDS; MANAGEMENT; CHALLENGES; DYNAMICS; AQUIFER; CLIMATE;
   RESOURCES
AB Groundwater on islands occurs in the form of freshwater lenses that serve as an important water resource for local inhabitants. These lenses are highly vulnerable to salinization due to natural recharge variations and groundwater abstraction. Determining the sustainable yield from freshwater lenses is challenging because the lens response during drought periods and the long-term effects of pumping are both difficult to predict. The exceptionally detailed and long data record for Bonriki Island of the Tarawa atoll (Kiribati) made it possible to develop a three-dimensional variable-density model of the island. Field data and modelling results highlight the strong control of rainfall variability and pumping on the temporal dynamics of the freshwater lens. The model reproduces the salinity observations in both monitoring and pumping wells reasonably well, and provides a rare example of physically based island simulation based on an extensive data set. It enables the analysis of freshwater volume and fluxes of submarine groundwater discharge, which is impossible based on the field observations alone. Under natural as well as abstraction conditions, submarine groundwater discharge responds rapidly and almost proportionally to recharge. Theoretical model scenarios with scaled abstraction rates show that lens contraction caused by pumping is a nearly linear function of the total pumped volume, whereby the abstraction rate and the timing of depletion are approximately inversely proportional. Modelling indicates that when monthly recharge inputs fall below around 2500 m(3)/d (i.e., a flux of 1.7 mm/d) plus the abstraction rate, the lens tends to contract. Thus, despite the highly distributed and extensive abstraction network on Bonriki Island, a significant amount of recharge is eventually lost to submarine groundwater discharge. The long-term freshwater storage trend indicates that Bonriki Island's lens is still contracting after 27.5 years of pumping, and lens thinning is threatening to impact the water supply salinity. This means that even permeable, small islands like Bonriki may take at least two decades to realise new equilibrium conditions that reflect pumping stresses, which is an important consideration in assessing the sustainable yield of small islands, in particular those less resilient to pumping than Bonriki.

However, as climatic drivers change over time, homogeneous regions should vary when the intra-annual patterns are of interest. In this paper we investigate the regionalization and changing patterns of maximum daily temperature in China based on the maximum air temperature (Tmax) derived from the CN05.1 daily surface air temperature gridded data from 1981 to 2010. We also propose an objective variable-based regionalization approach by combining the rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) method and K-means clustering analysis, to determine homogeneous regions effectively for such a large volume of daily grid data. The REOF approach is not able to identify discrete regional boundaries easily, but it is efficient at determining the number of regions and their rough spatial location. Furthermore, while clustering analysis suffers from convergence when the number of observations is large, it is able to provide clean boundaries between regions. The hybrid method tends to overcome their individual disadvantages while maintaining their individual advantages. The results show that the patterns of homogeneous regions have distinct features in both summer and winter seasons. The reasonableness of regionalization is then examined by the first principal component within regions, which shows the homogeneity within regions, and the scatterplots of Tmax time series between regions, which show the heterogeneity between regions. Furthermore, the boxplots of normalized Tmax within regions for both summer and winter seasons also clearly show the different characteristics of inter-annual variability in each region. In order to reveal detailed process of the change in the number and pattern of regions, we further conducted the regionalization for individual months and explored the potential linkages between regionalization and climatic conditions over time. This research is noteworthy in promoting research on regionalization with consideration of seasonal and intra-annual variation as well as extreme temperature events. The proposed hybrid regionalization method is broadly applicable to other regionalization studies.

AB The standard ensemble data assimilation schemes often violate the dynamical balances of hydrological models, in particular, the fundamental water balance equation, which relates water storage and water flux changes. The present study aims at extending the recently introduced Weak Constrained Ensemble Kalman Filter (WCEnKF) to a more general framework, namely unsupervised WCEnKF (UWCEnKF), in which the covariance of the water balance model is no longer known, thus requiring its estimation along with the model state variables. This extension is introduced because WCEnKF was found to be strongly sensitive to the (manual) choice of this covariance. The proposed UWCEnKF, on the other hand, provides a more general unsupervised framework that does not impose any (manual, thus heuristic) value of this covariance, but suggests an estimation of it, from the observations, along with the state. The new approach is tested based on numerical experiments of assimilating Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and remotely sensed soil moisture data into a hydrological model. The experiments are conducted over different river basins, comparing WCEnKF, UWCEnKF, and the standard EnKF. In this setup, the UWCEnKF constrains the system state variables with TWS changes, precipitation, evaporation, and discharge data to balance the summation of water storage simulations. In-situ groundwater and soil moisture measurements are used to validate the results of the UWCEnKF and to evaluate its performances against the EnKF. Our numerical results clearly suggest that the proposed framework provides more accurate estimates of groundwater storage changes and soil moisture than WCEnKF and EnKF over the different studied basins.

AB Bayesian inference provides a mathematically elegant and robust approach to constrain numerical model predictions with system knowledge and observations. Technical challenges, such as evaluating a large number of models with long runtimes, have restricted the application of Bayesian inference to groundwater modeling. To overcome such technical challenges, we use Gaussian process emulators to replace a transient regional groundwater MODFLOW model for computing objective functions during model constraining. The regional model is designed to assess the potential impact of a proposed coal seam gas (CSG) development on groundwater levels in the Richmond River catchment, Clarence-Moreton Basin, Australia. The emulators were trained using 4000 snapshots derived from the MODFLOW model and subsequently used to replace the MODFLOW model in an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) scheme. ABC was deemed the more appropriate choice as it relaxes the need to derive an explicit likelihood function that the formal Bayesian analysis requires. The study demonstrated the flexibility of the Gaussian process emulators, which can accurately reproduce the original model behavior at a fraction of the computational cost (from hours to seconds). The gain in computational efficiency using the proposed approach allows the global calibration and uncertainty algorithms to become more feasible for computationally demanding groundwater models. Based on the ABC analysis, the probability for the simulated CSG development causing a water table change of more than 0.2 m was less than 5%. In addition to a probabilistic estimate of the prediction, an added value of emulator-assisted ABC inference is providing information on the extent to which observations can constrain parameters and predictions, as well as the flexibility to include various quantitative and qualitative parameter constraining information.

AB Prediction of soil moisture is critical for water resources management. With Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellites by NASA, spatio-temporal interrelation between rainfall and soil moisture fields (at different extents) will be of great value for satellite product calibration/ validation and other hydrologic science investigations. In this study, we explored a non-parametric evolutionary algorithm for prediction of soil moisture from a time series of spatially-distributed rainfall across multiple weather locations under two different hydro-climatic regions. A new genetic algorithm-based hidden Markov model (HMMGA) was developed to estimate long-term soil moisture dynamics at different soil depths using precipitation data as a proxy. Also, we tested transposability of our approach across time under different climatic conditions. To test the new approach, we selected two different soil moisture fields, Oklahoma (130 km x 130 km) and Illinois (300 km x 500 km), during 1995-2009 and 1994-2010, respectively. We found that the newly developed framework performed well in predicting soil moisture dynamics at different spatial extents. Although our approach has limitations in predicting daily values, it estimates well the weekly soil moisture across the spatial and temporal domains with predictable uncertainties. Furthermore, this approach could provide advantages for good transposability under different weather conditions compared to those of physically-based hydrological models. Overall, our suggested approach could predict weekly soil moisture estimates with precipitation and soil moisture histories and showed the potential of transposability under different weather and land surface conditions. Since the proposed algorithm requires only precipitation (and historical soil moisture data) from existing, established weather stations, it can serve an attractive alternative that can forecast soil moisture using climate change scenarios.

AB Sulphur Springs Cave is an extensive phreatic cavity that produces a large, historic spring in the middle of metropolitan Tampa, Florida, USA. The city of Tampa extracts groundwater from the spring to supplement municipal water supply and to support low-salinity habitat in the estuarine Hillsborough River. Extraction at this site has occurred for many decades, but has intensified since the early 2000s, rapidly increasing the salinity of the spring and cave water. The purpose of this study was to address the potential sources and mechanisms of saltwater intrusion at this site using historical and current hydrochemical data published in the literature and online by government agencies. We also explored the cave to identify point-sources of intrusion, and collected water and biological samples from inside the cave to identify potential ecosystem impacts of increasing cave salinity. From 1946 to present, Sulphur Springs water shifted from being fresh (specific conductance < 500 mu S cm(-1)) and of calcium-sulfate type to being brackish (specific conductance similar to 5000 mu S cm(-1) and higher) and of sodium-chloride type. We found numerous vents in the cave that issue saline, thermal, sulfidic water and host distinct microbial mat communities. These vents are likely connected to bedrock fractures that provide preferential flow-paths along which confined, deep-sourced saline water enters the freshwater portion of the aquifer, probably originating from the coastal mixing zone. Salinity increased at the spring during dry-season pumping activity and after wet-season recharge events, which likely increased artesian pressure in confined saline aquifer units. Salinization of Sulphur Springs may disrupt the cave microbe and stygobite communities and eventually make the spring unsuitable to maintain low-salinity habitat in the Hillsborough River.

AB High level of arsenic-containing groundwater has been used for irrigation purposes for several decades in Asia, leading to fluctuating water table and redox conditions in the unsaturated zone, thereby potentially affecting the mobilization of arsenic in the unsaturated and saturated zones. A field plot experiment was conducted in the arsenic - affected area of the Datong Basin, China to determine the effects of irrigation return flow on the hydrogeochemical behavior of arsenic and iron in the unsaturated zone. High-arsenic groundwater was extracted from a shallow aquifer far from the irrigation site and used as irrigation water. Soil water/shallow groundwater and soil/sediment samples were collected at different depths from the field site during the experiment. Water samples were analyzed to determine hydrochemical properties and arsenic concentrations, and soil/sediment samples were analyzed to determine total iron and arsenic. Infiltration of irrigation water into the unsaturated zone led to fluctuations in the water table, varying redox conditions, and the redistribution of arsenic and iron in the near-surface soil/sediment. Soil/sediment bulk geochemical analysis results indicate obvious increases of arsenic and iron in topsoil after irrigation. Infiltration of irrigation water carrying organic matter, sulfate, and nitrate into the subsurface affects the (bio)geochemistry of the unsaturated and saturated zones, and ultimately the behavior of arsenic and iron. Geochemical modeling results suggest desorption and leaching processes are responsible for the temporal changes of arsenic concentrations in both pore water, groundwater and sediment during irrigation. The results of this study indicate that flood irrigation using arsenic-contaminated groundwater should be controlled and gradually replaced by drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation or irrigation using non-contaminated water resources to mitigate arsenic accumulation in the unsaturated zone and shallow groundwater.

AB Efficient simulation of rainfall-runoff relationships is one of the most complex problems owing to the high number of interrelated hydrological processes. It is well-known that machine learning models could fail in simulating streamflows from only meteorological variables in the absence of antecedent streamflow values. The main reason for this could be low and lagged relationships between streamflow and meteorological variables. To overcome this inefficiency, for the first time, we developed a simulation framework by coupling a base flow separation method to three machine learning methods. It was demonstrated that separating streamflow into different components such as base flow and surface flow can be useful for improving simulation and forecasting capabilities of machine learning models. We simulated streamflow in four rivers in the United States with Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forest (RF) as a function of precipitation (P), temperature (T) and potential evapotranspiration (PET). We concluded that the base flow separation method improved the simulation performances of the machine learning models to a certain degree. Apart from the simulation scheme, we also employed a forecasting scheme by using the antecedent observed discharge values in addition to P, T, and PET. We discussed performances of models in simulation and forecasting of streamflow regarding model types, input structures and catchment dynamics in detail.

AB Evaporation is an essential component in hydrological processes, and accurate estimation of evaporation is of importance for sustainable management of water resources. This study conducted a national-scale assessment of different models for pan evaporation (E-pan) estimation at 178 meteorological stations across different climatic zones of China, including the temperate continental zone (TCZ), temperate monsoon zone (TMZ), mountain plateau zone (MPZ) and subtropical monsoon zone (SMZ). Firstly, three data-driven models, including extreme learning machine (ELM), artificial neural networks optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO-ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA-ANN), were trained with nine input combinations of climatic variables. The performance of the 27 proposed models along with the empirical Stephens and Stewart (SS) and physically-based PenPan models were investigated and compared using relative root mean square error (RRMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and mean absolute error (MAE). The three statistical indicators were further normalized to global performance indicator (GPI), by which all the evaluated models can be easily ranked. The results showed that the data-driven models with complete inputs generally obtained more accurate E-pan estimation, where the ELM model with full input data provided the best accuracy, with average RRMSE of 12.5%-15.2%, NS of 0.909-0.936 and MAE of 11.7-19.9 mm/m. Air temperature was found to be the most influential parameter to data-driven models, followed by sunshine duration, wind speed and relative humidity. The SS model provided slightly better results in MPZ and TCZ, and slightly less accurate results in SMZ and TMZ, compared with the data-driven models under the same input conditions. Overall, ELM was recommended as the best model for E-pan estimation when all the selected climatic data are available, while temperature-based PSO-ANN is recommended in MPZ and SMZ and temperature-based GA-ANN is recommended in TCZ and TMZ when the other climatic data are missing.

AB The Yellow River subaqueous delta (YRSD), once the most rapid depo-center among river deltas worldwide, has been under the risks of subsidence and degradation due to the new regime of riverine delivery affected by human interventions. Utilizing hydrologic and bathymetric surveying datasets, we examined the latest regime of river input from the perspective of water-sediment relationship, and the responding morphological evolutionary processes of active YRSD over a period of 20 years between 1996 and 2016. Results show that the new discharge regime is strongly interfered by the Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS), characterized by a more drastic decline of sediment load than that of water discharge; more harmonious relationship between water and sediment discharges in the lower reach of the river to the sea; coarser sediment delivery and low suspended sediment concentration (SSC). We identified inverse erosion-accretion trends in the subaqueous region: net accretion of 0.15 m/yr in the active Yellow River mouth (AYRM) and severe erosion of - 0.1 m/yr in the Gudong littoral zone (GDLZ). As the primary sink for sediment delivery, AYRM received approximately 68% of sediment delivery during the study period and sedimentation was mainly occurred in the shallower area where water depth was less than 10 m. In addition, recent morphological evolution of AYRM is found to have undergone through four stages, namely: moderate accretion (1996-2002), rapid accretion (2002-2007), reduced accretion (2007-2015) and rapid erosion (2015-2016). The new regime of riverine delivery presents multiple spatiotemporal scales in shaping deltaic morphology. Compared with the previous research, we present the morphological evolution of deltaic system over decadal timescale is strongly influenced by reduction of sediment supply derived from basin-scale human impacts, and the variability of subaqueous portion during the study period is closely related to inter-annual variability of river input. Besides, the building of AYRM is shaped by event-scale WSRS induced-floodwater, and decade-scale change of sediment pathway governed by frequent mouth channel migration. The results show, for the first time, that AYRM has experienced a significant erosion since the implementation of WSRS, with a decline of 99% sediment delivery in 2016 compared to the natural mode during 1950s. The results also indicate that to maintain the erosion-accretion balance of AYRM, an estimation of 41.4-62.3 Mt/yr sediment delivery should be kept. Due to the fluvial regime change from the natural to the highly human-regulated modes, the AYRM, as well as the whole YRSD, is expected to be transforming from the accretion to erosion states.

AB The overarching goal of this study is to intercompare the newly released Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Version 05 (V05) products with its former Version 04 (VO4) and Version 03 (V03) products and also assess any differences and improvements, with cross-evaluation against the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Version 2.3, Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) Version 2.1 and the dense gauge networks in China. Firstly, the gauge-adjusted products (Final run) of V03, VO4 and V05 are compared over the globe. Then, the near-real-time products without gauge adjustments (Early and Late run) and Final run products of all versions are evaluated against ground-based observations comprised of more than 30,000 gauges over Mainland China at 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees grid and hourly and daily temporal scales. The primary conclusions are: (1) globally, both VO4 and V05 Final run show significant differences and improvements from V03. Particularly, the overall mean oceanic precipitation of VO4 and V05 increases by +31.36% and + 28.81% respectively from that of V03 and much closer to GPCP and MSWEP; (2) over Mainland China, the Early and Late run products of the same version (V03 or VO4) generally have similar performance, while VO4 Early and Late run have better performance in most regions than the corresponding run of V03 except in the arid Xinjiang Province and the mountainous Tibetan Plateau; and (3) VO4 and V03 Final run show comparable performance, while V05 Final run generally improves upon both VO4 and V03 and has the best performance among the seven standard IMERG products. The improvement of V05 Final run is particularly evident in southeastern and western China. At a timely matter, the study provides first-hand global and regional assessment feedback to IMERG algorithm developers and also sheds insights for GPM precipitation product users across the world.

AB Aiming at resolving the numerical problems caused by the improper friction source term treatment when simulating overland flow using 2D shallow water flow models, a proposed implicit method computing the friction source term is developed in this work. The method is able to not only accurately evaluate the tricky thin overland flow by considering the flow velocity varying in a single time step, but also eliminates the redundant iterations for regular implicit approach through converting the implicit scheme to an explicit equation. It is therefore an improved one in terms of accuracy and efficiency comparing to the existing methods. Furthermore, it is an independent part and can be straightforwardly and universally incorporated into any FVM based shallow water flow model. Such performances are validated against three test cases involving theoretical and practical overland flow problems. The results prove the proposed method treating friction source term could simulate overland flow problems in a relatively more accurate and efficient way, and therefore can effectively help extend the applicability of the shallow water models reliably computing both the open channel and overland flows.

AB The permanent wilting point (PWP) is the minimal point of soil moisture a plant requires not to wilt. If moisture decreases to this, or any lower point, a plant wilts, and can no longer recover its turgidity when placed in a saturated atmosphere for 12 h. The PWP is an essential physical property that has a powerful influence on other soil properties and is important for agricultural production, including irrigation water use efficiency and crop yield. However, there are few published datasets on the PWP of cultivated land in the arid and semi-arid regions of Northeast China. Direct measurements of PWP are time-consuming and expensive; therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate how environmental variables could be used in spatial predictions of PWP in an arid and semi-arid region based on boosted regression tree (BRT) and multiple linear stepwise regression (MLSR) analyses. Seventy soil samples and nine covariates (including topography and vegetation variables) were collected and analyzed. Cross-validation procedure was used to evaluate model performance and uncertainty. Accuracy evaluation results showed that the BRT model had better predictive performance than the MLSR. PWP content decreased from the southwest to the northeast of the study area, and average values of both models were 26%. BRT and MLSR models should be compared and calibrated to obtain the best prediction effect of PWP spatial distribution in similar areas. Elevation, slope gradient, profile curvature, topographic wetness index, and landuse variables are the main environmental indicators that should be included when generating PWP maps of regions with a dry, continental climate. Such information could aid local land managers and government agencies with evaluating soil quality and water sequestration potential. In conclusion, this study could be used as a reference for predicting the hydrological parameters of the topsoil in other similar ecological environments.

AB Glacier recession and formation of glacial lakes along with outburst flood hazards are increasing in response to changing climate in the Himalayan region. This study describes evolution of Dalung and Padam glaciers and their associated lakes employing multi-temporal datasets of Landsat (MSS, TM, ETM + ), Indian Remote Sensing LISS-III, Google Earth (TM), ASTER GDEM and Survey of India topographic maps. The Dalung Glacier (DG) and Lake (DL) are present in Suru River catchment whereas the Padam Glacier (PG) and Lake (PL) are present in Tsarap River catchment of Zanskar basin, western Himalaya. From 1962 to 2015; the DG and PG have shrunk at different rates. The DG has shrunk by 2.6 +/- 0.56 km(2) (19.2 +/- 4.1%) at a rate of 0.05 +/- 0.01 km(2) a(-1) whereas, the PG has shrunk by 3.4 +/- 0.65 km(2) (12.7 +/- 2.4%) at a rate of 0.06 +/- 0.01 km(2) a(-1). The frontal recession was recorded as 1.240 +/- 0.02 km (15.7 +/- 2.0%) at a rate of 20 +/- 0.4 m a(-1) for DG and 2.690 +/- 0.5 m (21.3 +/- 2.1%) at a rate of 50.7 +/- 0.1 m a(-1) for PG. Consequently, the proglacial glacial lakes have formed indicating an expansion of 20 +/- 3.4% (DL) and 58 +/- 4.5% (PL) during 1990-2015. Using integrated criteria of standard indices for the identification of potentially dangerous glacial lakes (PDGLs), the lakes were found to be vulnerable and have a potential to cause breaching in the coming years. In order to provide inputs for the emergency action plan, one dimensional MIKE 11 Model was used to generate the peak flood hydrographs at the lake and other vulnerable sites downstream. Highest peak discharge of 3361.7 m(3) s(-1) (DL) and 4210.3 m(3) s(-1) (PL) were estimated at the lake sites which has reduced to 1520.9 m(3) s(-1) and 1722.4 m(3) s(-1) respectively at the outlet sites. The reduced discharge at downstream sites still bears the potential to create dangerous flood hazards.

AB Green roofs are valuable solutions for rain management improvements in urban areas as they can partly store and delay rainfall water. Here, we point out that green roofs cannot be considered as static systems, which performances remain constant over time. This work is based on the cross-use of a lab-scale experiment and a modelling approach to evaluate the hydraulic performances of a green roof substrate over time. Experiments were conducted on new and aged materials, after 30 months of in situ aging. The experimental device was designed and implemented to simulate irrigation or rainfall and accurately monitor hydraulic fluxes. An estimation of hydraulic parameters was obtained by using inverse modelling of experimental data with HYDRUS-1D software. Comparisons between measured and modelled data demonstrated the reliability of the model for simulating the hydraulic behavior of the green roofs. Considering an incoming water event - which mimics a heavy rainfall - of 43 mm h(-1) and similar water content initial conditions, our simulations indicate that the retention capacity and the delay effect were always higher for the new substrate than for the aged one. Both of these performance indicators strongly vary with the initial water content of the substrates. Whereas the relation is linear for the retention capacity ranging from 100% of retention for the drier conditions to 0% for the saturated substrates, it is more complex for the delay effect. Such performances were comparable to analogous data from the existing literature. Furthermore, this comparison confirmed that green roofs are submitted to an early aging in terms of structure, i.e. porosity. In our study, the aged substrate presented less favorable performances thus highlighting the key role of the composition of green roof substrate not only on the initial performances but also on their sustainability.

AB Globally, water quality degradation severely threatens the security of water resources. Understanding a river's capacity to accommodate pollutants (or water environmental capacity: WEC) can help efficiently protect rivers. However, the requirement for comprehensive ground-observed hydrological and water quality data in previous methods makes it difficult to estimate WEC in areas with limited ground observations. This paper proposes a new framework for WEC estimation in data-scarce areas based on remotely sensed skin water temperature and limited ground observations. Two new models were developed to calculate the two critical parameters for WEC estimation: water temperature, and integrated pollutant degradation coefficients (k). Images of ASTER Surface Kinetic Temperature (AST 08) 90 m grid product were used to retrieve water temperatures. The above results were subsequently used to calculate a river's capacity to accommodate pollutants, or WEC, in agriculturally dominated areas. The use of remote sensing techniques enables the methods to be applied over large spatial scales and to areas with limited ground observations. The application and testing of the framework in four rivers, including two Chinese rivers (the Huai and the Wei Rivers) and two Australian rivers (the Ovens and the Gwydir Rivers), suggest that the models performed well to calculate the real-time water temperature and the coefficient k based on limited ground-observations. Uncertainty analysis on water temperature calculated from remotely sensed land surface temperature and ground-observed meteorological air temperature suggests that remotely sensed water temperature had high concurrence with ground observations (RMSE = 3.08 degrees C with R-2 = 0.88), while the sparse-spatially distributed meteorological stations reduced the accuracy in estimating water temperature (RMSE = 4.39 degrees C with R-2 = 0.91). We found that the coefficient (k) increased with water temperature over different seasons in an exponential form but in a logarithmical form with streamflow velocity. Comparison with previous research and other models with abundant data revealed the practicability and effectiveness of our models, which can be easily applied to rivers with insufficient ground observations across the globe.

AB Various types of regionalization approaches have been proposed in the last several decades for predictions in ungauged basins. The most commonly used methods are based on the proximity of catchment centroids and physiographic and/or climatic conditions of the catchments. However, the proximity of the catchment centroids and catchment physical attributes do not necessarily translate into similarities in hydrologic behavior. It is also difficult to identify the key attributes that favor hydrologic similarity. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a new method called catchment runoff-response similarity (CRRS), in the view of reducing the hydrologic process predictive uncertainty and to solve the problem of the key attributes identification that favor hydrologic similarity. The CRRS has a two-step approach: 1) the commonly used regionalization approach is used to temporarily transpose the calibrated model parameter from gauged to ungauged catchments, and 2) the runoff response of each smaller delineated subbasin of the gauged and ungauged basins are obtained based on the parameter value computed in the first step. The similar subbasins of the gauged and ungauged basins are then identified based on their runoff response similarity. The final parameter value in the ungauged subbasins are determined based on the notion that similar subbasins with runoff responses to similar input rainfall could have similar model structure settings. The applicability of the proposed approach was verified for the Geum River Basin (GRB) of South Korea and the Lake Tana Basin (LTB) of Ethiopia. Leave-one-out evaluations of the proposed parameter transfer approach at various test-gauging stations showed that the CRRS approach outperformed the other widely used methods. The CRRS in the GRB and LTB, reached 91% and 77% during the calibration and 86% and 67% during the validation period, respectively, of the at-site calibrated model performance on average over the test stations. The overall worth of the CRRS over the second best commonly used regionalization approach were also found to be 10% and 14% during the calibration and 7% and 4% during the validation period in the GRB and LTB, respectively. In general, it can be concluded from the overall result that the runoff predictive uncertainty in the ungauged catchments of the two study basins was significantly reduced by the CRRS approach. Therefore, the proposed approach can be used as an alternative method for runoff prediction in the ungauged basins worldwide.

AB A double-sided stochastic chance-constrained linear fractional programming (DSCLFP) model is developed for managing irrigation water under uncertainty. The model is developed by incorporating double-sided stochastic chance-constrained programming (DSCCP) into a linear fractional programming (LFP) optimization framework. It can address ratio optimization problems with double-sided randomness (i.e. both left-hand and right-hand sides). More importantly, it also improves upon the existing stochastic chance-constrained programming for handing random uncertainties in the left-hand and right-hand sides of constraints simultaneously. A non-equivalent but sufficient linearization form of the DSCLFP is provided and proved, which will greatly reduce the computational burden. Then, the model is applied to a case study in Yingke Irrigation District (YID) in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin, northwest China. Four confidence levels (e.g. alpha = 0.85, 0.90, 0.95 and 0.99) are provided to examine and compare the results. The objective function values are slightly decreased from 5.284 Yuan/m(3) to 5.276 Yuan/m(3) when alpha(i) level is raised from 0.85 to 0.99. The results from the DSCLFP can identify desired irrigation water allocation plans under the objective function of maximizing water productivity under different confidence levels. Therefore, the results can provide tradeoffs among water productivity, confidence level and constraint-violation risk level. Moreover, comparisons with double-sided stochastic chance-constrained linear programming (DSCLP) model and deterministic model are introduced to highlight advantages and feasibility of the developed model. Therefore, these results can provide decision-support for managers in arid areas.

AB Recently, a combination of model predictive control and a reduced genetic algorithm (RGA-MPC) has shown to be an efficient control technique for real-time flood control, making use of fast conceptual river models. This technique was so far only tested under ideal circumstances of perfect model predictions. Prediction errors originating from hydrodynamic model mismatches, however, result in a deterioration of the real-time control performance. Therefore, this paper presents two extensions of the RGA-MPC technique. First, a new type of conceptual model is introduced to further increase the computational efficiency. This reduced conceptual model is specially tailored for real-time flood control applications by eliminating all unnecessary intermediate calculations to obtain the flood control objectives and by introducing a new transport element by means of flow matrices. Furthermore, the RGA-MPC technique is extended with a flexible data assimilation approach that analyzes the past observed errors and applies an appropriate error prediction scheme. The proposed approach largely compensates for the loss in control performance due to the hydrodynamic model uncertainty.

AB Water movement in hillslopes is determined by the subsurface characteristics that control flow paths connecting precipitation to stream flow. The hydrological response of hillslopes is notoriously non-linear and non-stationary; with the relative importance of vertical and lateral flow paths also depending on event characteristics and antecedent conditions. In northern boreal regions, climate change projections indicate that wetter and warmer winter conditions are likely to generate more extreme flood events. Here, we report a study from an upland catchment in northern Scotland where a monitoring year provided an opportunity to contextualise observations during the hillslope response to a winter rainfall event that locally caused the most extreme flooding for over 200 years. Monitoring the hillslope water table, soil moisture and isotopes in precipitation, groundwater and stream flow provided invaluable insight into hillslope-riparian coupling. Groundwater with a shallow water table ( < 0.05 m deep) in poorly drained valley bottom drift deposits maintained almost fully saturated and stream-connected peat soil profiles in riparian areas. In the wettest periods, the groundwater beneath the peat was artesian. On steeper hillslopes, soils were drier and the water table was generally deeper (0.5-1 m below ground level), though the profile could fully saturate and groundwater levels reach the surface during the wettest period. Groundwater in deeper wells typically showed an anti-clockwise hysteresis compared to stream flow, and peak levels typically lagged behind the stream by a few hours in the valley bottom and > 1 day in the upper hillslope. In contrast, shallower wells in the soil profiles in the riparian area showed a more responsive perched groundwater system with transmissivity feedback in the upper soil layers resulting in much more rapid responses which generally peaked before the stream and exhibited clockwise hysteresis. Analysis of stable isotopes in precipitation, groundwater and streamflow, indicated that groundwater was remarkably well mixed with limited fractionation effects, inferring precipitation on the upper, unconfined hillslopes was the dominant source of recharge - particularly during the winter. The study shows that groundwater plays two roles in generating stream flow: a constant baseflow supply to the stream and time varying-exfiltration into the edge of the riparian zone, which contributes to surface runoff during storm events.

AB In this work, we have used the Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to examine streamflow variability of the Lower Mekong River Basin (LMRB) associated with changes in the Upper Mekong River Basin (UMRB) inflows. Two hypothetical experiments were formulated and evaluated for the LMRB, where we conducted runoff simulations with multiple inflow changes that include upstream runoff yield increase and decrease scenarios. Streamflow variability of the LMRB was quantified by two streamflow metrics that explain flow variability and predictability, and high flow disturbance. The model experiments were performed for the Lower Mekong River Basin with identical climate, soil, and other watershed characteristics data. Remote sensing precipitation (Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission, TRMM, and Global Precipitation Measurement mission, GPM), meteorological data as well as spatial data that include a digital elevation model, newly developed soil information (Harmonized World Soil Database, HWSD), and land use and land cover were processed as input to the LMRB model simulations. Observed daily streamflow data along the Lower Mekong River from Chiang Sean, Thailand to Kratie, Cambodia were used for calibration and validation. Our work results suggest that the Lower Mekong River streamflow is highly variable and has a low predictability (Colwell index of about 32%). We found that releasing more water from upstream Mekong during rainfall months by 30% would result in a reduction in the Lower Mekong streamflow predictability by about 21%. This reduction in predictability is mainly attributed to a decrease in the Contingency index. Our work shows that the ability to predict floods/droughts at the Lower Mekong River would be reduced if there is any anticipated change (i.e., increase/decrease) from UMRB releases. Our results also show that releasing more flows from the upstream Mekong would also affect flood duration and the frequency of flood occurrences downstream. The results of this work thus help to quantify the sensitivity of streamflow variability at the Lower Mekong River Basin to upstream anthropogenic changes.

AB Tidal asymmetry in deltas is caused by both the intrinsic asymmetry, resulting from the combination of astronomical tides, and by nonlinear tidal interactions that occur in shallow water. The relative importance of these sources of tidal asymmetry in delta channel networks have remained poorly studied, partly due to the limitations of classical harmonic analysis (HA) in hindcasting nonstationary tides. The Pearl River Delta (PRD) is a multichannel system with rapidly changing bathymetry, subject to severe human interventions. This work applies a nonstationary harmonic model (NS_TIDE) to hydrological data from 15 stations in the PRD spanning the period 1961-2012. The spatiotemporal variation of multiple sources of tidal asymmetry is quantified by a skewness metric, revealing how similar or dissimilar the development of alternative sources of tidal asymmetry develop in the delta subject to study. A relative sensitivity coefficient (RSC) is introduced to decompose the contribution of tidal amplitude variations to multiple tidal asymmetries. Analytical results show the development of tides becoming gradually more asymmetric as they propagate into delta channel networks, and how this depends on the river flow. Variation in the orientation of tidal asymmetries induced by different combinations of tidal constituents leads to a complex pattern of the overall tidal asymmetry in the PRD. Our results show that tidal asymmetry in deltas can be significantly dependent on the river flow.

AB The study aims to examine the effect of ponds on changes in water quality in a young glacial river catchment. The goal was to identify situations where a periodic hydrographic network is formed in outflow-free areas, which is connected with a higher order receiving area, as well as to study the circulation of matter in this type of system. This study answers the following key question: Do ponds affected by areal pollution substantially affect water quality in streams in periods where they become joined with the hydrographic network? The purpose of the research was to identify patterns associated with the functioning of ponds in young glacial areas in northern Poland on the example of the Borucinka catchment. Ponds were selected in order to generate a study sample characterized by different types of land use, local hydrology, and pond surface area. The study focused on the effects of catchment land use on pond water quality and the effects of periodic changes in local hydrology (linkage of surface flows with bodies of water) on pond water quality. Research has shown that land use in a pond catchment yields a substantial effect on pond water quality. The basic reason for the higher concentration of selected ions is close proximity to farms that generate wastewater, which reaches bodies of water in the study area. Seasonal changes in the concentration of biogenic substances were not observed in ponds. Only notable changes in the concentration of total nitrogen were observed due the episodic formation of a hydrographic network consisting of a collection of linked depressions. One of the more surprising findings was that permanently isolated ponds, which theoretically collect catchment pollutants all the time, are characterized by good hydrochemical conditions.

AB Potential influences of climate change on water quality, riverine suspended sediments, nitrogen and organic matter loads in temporally frozen rivers, which have ice-covered flow and snow-affected basins, are poorly understood. However, before being able to understand potential future changes, the impact of ice and snow needs to be investigated more thoroughly for years which were hydrologically different. We investigated seasonal and event scale concentration-discharge (C-Q) dynamics of total suspended solids/turbidity, nitrate-N (NO3-N) and chemical oxygen demand (COD), which is indicative of the amount of organic matter in river water. In particular, the influence of ice cover, contrasting spring thaw, and soil frost conditions on infra-annual fluxes and the C-Q response of the three solutes are detected based on over four years of hourly data. Seasonally flow-weighted suspended solids and NO3-N concentrations were at their highest in either the autumn or spring thaw, but COD concentrations were the highest each year in autumn. NO3-N and COD levels typically decreased during winter. The ice-covered river water was less turbid compared to open-channel water at an equivalent river discharge likely due to in-stream factors. Storms during the freshet period introduced flushing of organic matter and suspended solids. The ratio of organic matter yield to water yield was similar each freshet and was independent of the amount of precipitation as snow or soil frost status. The freshet NO3-N yield per water yield was higher during the years with a thick snowpack and the consequent thawed soil compared to a year with soil frost and minor snowpack. 91 storm events studied revealed differences and similarities in storm dynamics in between the three variables. Anti-clockwise hysteresis was most common for the variables, with turbidity peaking faster than the COD or NO3-N concentration in most of the storms. Snowmelt storms showed highly variable C-Q responses inbetween the variables. However, spring thaw-related COD concentration peaks abated more slowly compared to turbidity or NO3-N. NO3-N showed a strong dilution pattern during several autumn storms during an extremely wet year, indicating limited N sources for flushing from the catchment. As a result, the flow-weighted mean NO3-N concentration was not the largest during the year of largest water yield instead which was true for suspended solids and COD. We found no evidence that wanner winters with precipitation as rain instead of snow would increase suspended sediment, organic matter and NO3-N load at entire winter-spring season or annual timescales.

AB A comprehensive framework composed of stormwater indices (e.g., stormwater runoff, runoff pollution) and anthropogenic heat is proposed to facilitate selection of key areas for sponge-like urban reconstruction based on the integration of emergy analysis and GIS models. A case study in Shenzhen is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in aiding the implementation of sponge city reconstruction. Specifically, natural and man-made releases are identified and accounted for in emergy units (seJ). When compared to the emergy values of natural releases (4.99E + 14-7.59E +14 seJ) and man-made releases (1.79E + 14-5.8E +16 seJ) within the Shenzhen Basic Ecological Control Line (designated as an ecological preservation area), the emergy values of both types of releases outside the Basic Ecological Control Line are higher, ranging from 7.59E+ 14 seJ to 8.32E +14 seJ for the former and from 5.8E +16 seJ to 1.86E + 17 seJ for the latter. Nine sub-districts in Shenzhen, China, such as industrial parks, transportation and bare land for construction are preliminarily chosen as areas for potential sponge-like urban reconstruction on the basis of man-made releases, and are then confirmed by examining natural releases. The proposed emergy-GIS framework can bridge the gap between empirical studies and standardize research to ensure that the results of the green infrastructure plan live up to the rhetoric.

AB Plastic mulching has been widely used in arid regions because it can decrease soil water evaporation and raise soil temperature. Previous studies, however, treated soil water evaporation under plastic mulch to be negligible, assuming that the plastic mulch can prevent water exchange between soil and atmosphere completely. In order to demonstrate validity of this assumption, experiments were conducted from 2014 to 2016 under irrigated maize (Zea mays) field in Northwest China, comparison experiments of soil water evaporation between mulched soil and the bare soil between mulches were carried out in two seed maize fields with different irrigation method, i.e. border irrigation under mulch (Site BM) and drip irrigation under mulch (Site DM), with micro-lysimeters placed under the plastic mulched soil and the bare soil between mulches to evaluate soil water evaporation of each experiment maize field. Our observations indicated that the soil water evaporation under plastic mulch (E-ms) was about 4.04-7.07% of the total evapotranspiration, among which E-ms in the daytime accounted for 3.58-5.37% of the total evapotranspiration and 0.99-2.10% of the total evapotranspiration in the nighttime. Thus E-ms was considered not to be negligible. For two experiment sites, soil water evaporation under bare soil between mulches (E-bs) was obviously higher than the soil water evaporation under plastic mulch (E-ms) in daytime, but the former was lower than the latter in the nighttime. At night, the mean soil temperature in the mulched soil was higher than that in the bare soil because of the warming effect of the plastic mulch. A soilmulch-canopy-atmosphere model is used to consider the effects of the mulch, and the modeling results further support this finding. These results provide a new insight for understanding the effect of plastic mulch on water use efficiency.

The Brinkman's model is a hybrid formulation that allows the use of a single transport equation to model fluid flow in both the free-flow and porous regions of a karst aquifer, by transitioning between the Stokes equation and the Darcy's law. However, the Brinkman's model is computationally expensive, requiring the solution of four different equations to obtain the pressures and velocities in a three-dimensional aquifer. Darcy's model provides a cheaper alternative, because it allows the substitution of the Darcy's equation into the mass conservation equation and thus requires the solution of only one parabolic equation. However, while the Darcy's model produces accurate results within the porous medium, it fails to provide satisfactory results in the free-flow regions of the karst aquifers. We propose a sector modeling approach to model fluid flow in karst aquifers. The sector modeling approach takes advantage of both the computational inexpensiveness of the Darcy's model and the accuracy of Brinkman's model in the caves. This method was compared to the Brinkman's model and the Darcy's model. Three examples are presented to study the effectiveness of the sector modeling technique. The first example is a simple model consisting of a straight conduit surrounded by porous regimes on either side while the second and third examples are more complicated structures consisting of complex geometrical caves embedded in a highly heterogeneous porous medium. Results show that the sector modeling approach provides an excellent match to the Brinkman's model and with much faster computations. Specifically, sector modeling was 4.6 times faster than the Brinkman's model in the first example, 13 times faster in the second; and 25 times faster in the third example. We also observed negligible deterioration in accuracy of results from sector modeling when the size of the extracted sector relative to the full-field is reduced.

AB Quantifying and reducing uncertainties in physics-based hydrological model parameters will improve model reliability for hydrological forecasting. We present an uncertainty quantification framework that combines the strengths of stepwise sensitivity analysis and adaptive surrogate-based multi-objective optimization to facilitate practical assessment and reduction of model parametric uncertainties. Framework performance was tested using the distributed hydrological model Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST) for daily streamflow simulation over ten watersheds. By identifying sensitive parameters stepwisely, we reduced the number of parameters requiring calibration from twelve to seven, thus limiting the dimensionality of calibration problem. By updating surrogate models adaptively, we found the optimal sets of sensitive parameters with the surrogate-based multiobjective optimization. The calibrated CREST was able to satisfactorily simulate observed streamflow for all watersheds, improving one minus Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (1 -NSE) by 65-90% and percentage absolute relative bias (vertical bar RB vertical bar) by 60-95% compared to the default. The validation result demonstrated that the calibrated CREST was also able to reproduce observed streamflow outside the calibration period, improving 1 - NSE by 40-85% and (vertical bar RB vertical bar) by 35-90% compared to the default. Overall, this uncertainty quantification framework is effective for assessment and reduction of model parametric uncertainties, the results of which improve model simulations and enhance understanding of model behaviors.

AB Land-use change and climate variability have the potential to alter river flow and groundwater resources dramatically, especially by modifying actual evapotranspiration. Seven catchments with intermittent flow dominated by either winter-active perennial pastures (4 catchments) or Eucalyptus globulus plantations (3 catchments), located in 3 geologic settings of southeastern Australia, were studied for over 6 years to determine the primary controls on water resources. Groundwater levels in the pasture sites were stable through the 2011-2016 study period, while levels in the plantations declined in the same period. Streamflow occurred mainly during winter. Annual streamflow showed no difference clearly attributable to pasture versus plantation land use. The presence of grass buffers along streams enhances groundwater recharge and saturation-dependent overland flow, reducing the impacts of the plantations on streamflow. Site water balances indicated that the average annual actual evapotranspiration was 87-93% of precipitation for pasture catchments and 102-108% of precipitation for plantation catchments. Actual evapotranspiration greater than precipitation at the plantations was attributed to uptake of groundwater by the root system in parts of the catchments. Thus, change to groundwater storage is a critical component in the water balance. Actual evapotranspiration from pasture catchments was higher than previously estimated from global pasture and cropping data, instead matching global precipitation versus actual evapotranspiration curves for treed catchments.

AB The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is the world's largest hydrological project. However, the response of thallium (Tl) in TGR sediments to reservoir operation remains highly uncertain. Here, we investigated the pollution characteristics of Tl in TGR sediments during five consecutive water seasons. Geochemical baseline concentrations (GBCs) were used to distinguish the anthropogenic input of Tl and to quantitatively estimate the Tl anthropogenic contribution in TGR sediments. The results showed that the average Tl concentration in TGR sediments was 0.72 +/- 0.14 mg/kg (ranging from 0.26 to 1.07 mg/kg) during five consecutive water seasons. The average Tl content in tributary sediment was higher than that in mainstream sediment. In the mainstream, Tl in TGR sediments showed an accumulation tendency from the upstream to downstream. Additionally, the temporal variation revealed that the mean value of Tl in TGR sediments in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season during 2015-2016. Furthermore, the average GBCs of Tl (0.71 mg/kg) was higher than background values (BVs) in the Yangtze River sediments. Using the GBCs of different water seasons to calculate the anthropogenic input of Tl in the TGR, the average anthropogenic contribution was found to be approximately 6.43% (2.81%-9.12%). The assessment results by two different methods (geo-accumulation index and potential ecological risk index) used GBCs as the BVs, indicating that TGR sediments were at "uncontaminated" level and close to the "low ecological risk", respectively. Comparing to the GBC of Tl, the assessment of Tl pollution in TGR using BVs in the Yangtze River sediments may be over-evaluated. This study is beneficial for assessing Tl pollution in TGR sediments response to consecutive water seasons and estimating the anthropogenic contribution of Tl.

AB Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) of surface soil changes substantially with space and time, and it is of great importance for many ecological, agricultural, and hydrological applications. In general, K is measured in the laboratory, or more commonly, predicted using soil water retention curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity. In the field, K can be determined through infiltration experiments. However, none of these approaches are capable of continuously monitoring K in-situ at fine depth scales. In this study, we propose and investigate an approach to continuously estimate fine depth-scale K dynamics under field conditions. Evaporation rate and change in water storage in a near-surface soil layer are measured with the heat pulse method. Then, water flux density at the lower boundary of the soil layer is estimated from evaporation rate, change in water storage, and rainfall or irrigation rate using a simple water balance approach. Finally, K values at different soil depths are derived using the Buckingham-Darcy equation from water flux densities and measured water potential gradients. A field experiment is performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. K values at 2-, 4-, 7.5-, and 12.5-cm depths are estimated with the new approach. The results show that in-situ K estimates vary with time following changes in soil water content, and the K-water content relationship changes with depth due to the difference in bulk density. In-situ estimated K-matric potential curves agree well with those measured in the laboratory. In-situ K estimates also show good agreement with the Mualem-van Genuchten model predictions, with an average root mean square error in log(10) (K, mm h(-1)) of 0.54 and an average bias of 0.17. The new approach provides reasonable in-situ K estimates and has potential to reveal the influences of natural soil conditions on hydraulic properties as they change with depth and time.

AB To improve the behavioural realism of a water resource model, this study coupled hydrologic modelling with stated preference research, thereby incorporating an empirical estimate of behavioural parameters to represent residents' landscape decisions in an urban environment. The stated preference data came from a discrete choice experiment in which residents were asked to choose among several possible lawn plots - varying in size, turf variety, and aesthetic qualities. The discrete choice experiment also included subsidies for lawn replacement, and information about estimated water use and watering costs for each lawn choice. We prepared a behavioural model utilizing coefficients from a mixed logic model estimated from the stated preference data, and then coupled it with a water resources model of the Okanagan Basin using the Water Evaluation and Planning System. We then conducted a scenario analysis using the coupled socio-hydrological model to simulate the extent to which residents would adopt alternative lawns under varying incentives and subsequently computed corresponding changes in water demand. The results indicate that proposing alternative lawn configurations to residents and providing site-specific information about the potential for reduced watering costs, along with a small subsidy, could lead to considerable reduction of outdoor water use through voluntary adoption. Under a scenario in which the attributes of the suggested lawn configuration matched those most preferred by residents in the choice experiment, the suggested configuration was widely adopted in the Okanagan, but a scenario with a more extreme water conserving lawn configuration reduced overall outdoor water use by a greater amount even though the configuration was adopted by a smaller percentage of residents. This study illustrates the relationship between lawn preferences and water use and supports calls to integrate hydrological and social modelling in order to capture the complex interactions between human behaviour and water use.

AB Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a promising proximal soil sensing technique to estimate soil moisture at intermediate scale and high temporal resolution. However, the signal shows complex and non-unique response to all hydrogen pools near the land surface, providing some challenges for soil moisture estimation in practical applications. Aims of the study were 1) to assess the uncertainty of CRNS as a stand-alone approach to estimate volumetric soil moisture in cropped field 2) to identify the causes of this uncertainty 3) and possible improvements. Two experimental sites in Germany were equipped with a CRNS probe and point-scale soil moisture network. Additional monitoring activities were conducted during the crop growing season to characterize the soil-plant systems. This data is used to identify and quantify the different sources of uncertainty (factors). An uncertainty analysis, based on Monte Carlo approach, is applied to propagate these uncertainties to CRNS soil moisture estimations. In addition, a sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol' method is performed to identify the most important factors explaining this uncertainty. Results show that CRNS soil moisture compares well to the soil moisture network when these point-scale values are weighted to account for the spatial sensitivity of the signal and other sources of hydrogen (lattice water and organic carbon) are added to the water content. However, the performance decreases when CRNS is considered as a stand-alone method to retrieve the actual (non-weighted) volumetric soil moisture. The support volume (penetration depth and radius) shows also a considerable uncertainty, especially in relatively dry soil moisture conditions. Four of the seven factors analyzed (the vertical soil moisture profile, bulk density, incoming neutron correction and the calibrated parameter N o ) were found to play an important role. Among the possible improvements identified, a simple correction factor based on vertical point-scale soil moisture profiles shows to be a promising approach to account for the sensitivity of the CRNS signal to the upper soil layers.

AB The sediment delivery ratio (SDR) is a bond of slope erosion and channel sediment transport but exhibits poor dynamic applicability, which makes it difficult to accurately identify the spatio-temporal evolutions of sediment yield in an ecological restoration watershed with different governance degrees. i) An innovative piecewise SDR algorithm considering the multi-stage effects of the comprehensive governance degree from 1991 to 2013 was embedded in a dynamic sediment yield model to solve the complex dynamic applicability problem of the SDR in sediment yield predictions. ii) The main advantages of the improved SDR algorithm over the existing models are small data requirements, dynamic mechanism, wide application range, reduced complexity, ease of use and better accuracy. iii) The erosion intensities of sloping farmland and orchards in the Yangou River watershed were both intensive at the early stage of governance in 1997. The trends in erosion and sediment yield were closely related to the watershed management measures. The soil erosion modulus in this watershed decreased from 5657 t/km(2) in 1997 to 906.2 t/km(2) in 2012, a total decrease rate of 84%. The sediment yield modulus decreased from 4500 t/km(2) in 1997 to 51.9 t/km(2) in 2012, a total reduction rate of 98.8%. iv) The annual dynamics of the SDR values were not completely affected by the random fluctuations in rainfall erosivity but showed an obvious decreasing trend from 0.932 in 1992 to 0.057 in 2012 due to the soil conservation measures. The annual average SDR in 1991-2013 was approximately 0.38, indicating that the average sediment yield after ecological restoration was significantly less than the average soil erosion in the Yangou River watershed. The results of this study may provide a better understanding of dynamic SDR studies and reveal the profound insights needed to guide watershed soil conservation planning.

AB High-resolution gridded precipitation products are rare globally, particularly below a daily time-step, yet many hydrological applications require, or can be improved by, a higher temporal resolution of rainfall data. Here, we present a new 1 km resolution gridded hourly rainfall dataset for Great Britain (Gridded estimates of hourly areal rainfall for Great Britain (1990-2014) [CEH-GEAR1hr]) using data from over 1900 quality controlled rainfall gauges, which improves upon the current UK national gridded precipitation datasets at daily time-step. We extend and automate a quality control (QC) procedure to permit the use of hourly data for 1990-2014 and independently validate the QC using daily rainfall data and recorded historic events. Our two-tiered validation approach, at daily and hourly timescales, indicates that spurious extreme values are excluded from the resultant dataset, while legitimate values are preserved. We use a nearest neighbour interpolation scheme to derive gridded hourly rainfall values at 1 km resolution, to temporally disaggregate the CEH-GEAR daily gridded dataset and produce an hourly dataset with consistent daily totals. This provides a unique resource for hydrological applications in Great Britain. The CEH-GEAR1hr dataset, associated metadata and QC information, will be freely available from the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) and hosted alongside the daily and monthly CEH-GEAR product.

AB Most hydrological models simulate snowmelt using a degree day or simplified energy balance method, which usually requires a calibration of snow-related parameters using discharge data. Despite its apparent efficiency, this method leads to empirical relations which are not proven to remain valid in a changing climate. The direct application of robust physically-based snow models in hydrological modeling is difficult due to the high number of not easily available input variables this model type requires. The objective of this study is to test the robustness of a physically-based snowpack model that requires only a limited number of common meteorological parameters. The MASiN model computes the energy and mass balance of multiple layers of the snowpack using hourly air temperature, relative humidity and wind speeds, as well as daily precipitations. MASiN was tested at 23 sites across Canada and Sweden, using a unique set of parameters fixed at a single site. At each site, the snow depth simulated by MASiN was compared against measurements. Robustness was challenged by comparing MASiN's performance to that of three other models on three different criteria. MASiN showed the highest robustness among the tested models. With a unique set of parameters, it showed better results than the three reference models when used in similar conditions and matched their performances when reference models were calibrated at each site. The results prove non-data intensive physically based models to be promising tools for hydrological and other snow cover-related studies.

AB With rapid urbanization, rainstorm-induced inundation losses are becoming increasingly severe. Research on urban inundation response to rainstorm patterns can help engineers and governments make appropriate decisions and mitigate property losses. This paper introduces a new hydrodynamic model that couples the storm water management model (SWMM) and the shallow water model (SWM) and applies the validated model to the Haidian Island case to determine the inundation response to rainstorm patterns. The results show that the coupled model can predict rainstorm-induced inundation well, and that different rainstorm patterns would result in different inundation patterns. With increasing rainstorm peak position coefficients, urban inundation events become more severe and inundation peaks appear sooner. However, the times at which inundation occurs do not change. To determine the reasons for the differences in inundation among different rainstorm patterns, correlations between the inundation volume and the fully-filled pipes ratio were analyzed. Correlation analysis showed that inundation events are significantly related to the working state of the sewer system, indicating that a higher fully-filled pipes ratio prior to the rainstorm peak will result in more severe inundation. This conclusion suggests that the range of rainstorm peak position coefficients in China is quite reasonable. This result can provide insights to engineers and the government for urban design planning and maintenance.

AB Water stage variations are complicated in tidal rivers due to the combination of upstream flood and downstream tide. This study proposed a bidirectional stage routing model (BSR) for tidal rivers by considering the stage hydrograph as the overlay of bidirectional propagation of upstream flood wave and downstream tidal wave. The basic stage routing equations derived from the storage equation and water balance equation are used to calculate the upstream flood wave routing and the downstream tidal wave propagation, respectively. The lateral inflow can be directly specified as an additive term in the basic equation of BSR model or indirectly estimated by a lateral flow rate reflecting the proportion of lateral inflow to the upstream water. Parts of the model parameters are time-variable to account for the effect of water surface slope on water stage. The model inputs include stage hydrographs at the upstream and downstream boundaries. The channel geometric characteristics data are not required when the average channel width is estimated as a parameter. The case study results in the tidal reaches of the Caoe River and Qiantang River in China demonstrate that the BSR model performs well in water stage simulation. With relatively simple structure, modest data requirement and stable performance, the physically-based BSR model has the potential for water stage routing in tidal rivers when channel geometry data are not available.

AB Urban pluvial flooding is a global challenge that is frequently caused by the lack of available infiltration, retention and drainage capacity in cities. This paper presents RUFIDAM, an urban pluvial flood model, developed using GIS technology with the intention of rapidly estimating flood extent, depth and its associated damage. RUFIDAM integrates a 1D hydraulic drainage network model (SWMM or MOUSE) with an adapted version of rapid flood inundation models. One-metre resolution topographic data was used to identify depressions in an urban catchment. Volume-elevation relationships and minimum elevation between adjacent depressions were determined. Mass balance considerations were then used to simulate movement of water between depressions. Surcharge volumes from the 1D drainage network model were fed statically into the rapid inundation model. The model was tested on three urban catchments located in southeast Melbourne. Results of flood depth, extent and damage costs were compared to those produced using MIKE FLOOD; a well-known 1D-2D hydrodynamic model. Results showed that RUFIDAM can predict flood extent and accumulated damage cost with acceptable accuracy. Although some variations in the simulated location of flooding were observed, simulation time was reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to MIKE FLOOD. As such, RUFIDAM is suitable for large-scale flood studies and risk-based approaches that rely on a large number of simulations.

AB Water-use efficiency and uncertainty treatment are foci in the modeling of agricultural water management systems. To address these challenging issues, a robust fractional programming (RFP) method that coupled fractional programming with robust optimization was developed in this study to improve agricultural water-use efficiency under uncertainty. RFP improved upon the fractional programming by being able to tackle highly uncertain information without known distributions. It also extended the capability of the robust optimization method in addressing ratio optimal problems. To demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability, RFP was applied to a long-term agricultural water resources management problem in arid north-west China, where water scarcity and low water-use efficiency hindered local development. It generated benefit- and risk-explicit plans for crop pattern adjustments. Vegetables were recommended as the preferred crop. A number of scenarios combining different fluctuation and protection levels were analyzed and interpreted with practical implications. It was observed that higher water-use efficiency could be achieved through reducing parametric uncertainty and risk-aversion levels. Simulation experiments validated that the benefits claimed by the RFP model were sufficiently conservative and could be reliably achieved. The comparisons of RFP results against the baseline operations and those from two other alternatives demonstrated that, RFP could result in higher resource-use efficiency and controllable system-violation risks. The developed approach is also applicable to other optimization problems aiming at enhancing resource-use efficiency under uncertainty.

AB On the Tibetan Plateau, climate change, particularly increases in air temperature, significantly affects cryospheric and hydrological processes. Based on 5 typical future climate scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) under emission scenario RCP4.5 and a distributed ecohydrological model (GBEHM), this study analyzes the potential characteristics of future climate change (from 2011 to 2060) and the associated effects on the cryospheric and hydrological processes in the upper Heihe River Basin, a typical cold mountain region located on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The precipitation, air temperature, and frozen ground elasticities of runoff/evapotranspiration are then estimated based on the simulation results. The typical future climate scenarios suggest that air temperature will increase at an average rate of 0.34 degrees C/10a in the future and that precipitation will increase slightly by 6 mm/10a under the RCP 4.5 emission scenario. Based on the GBEHM-simulated results, due to the increase in air temperature, glaciers would be reduced to less than 100 million m(3) by 2060, the permafrost area would shrink by 23%, the maximum frozen depth of seasonally frozen ground would decrease by 5.4 cm/10a and the active layer depth of the frozen ground would increase by 6.1 cm/ 10a. Additionally, runoff would decrease by approximately 5 mm/10a, and evapotranspiration would increase by approximately 9 mm/10a. The estimated elasticities indicate that annual runoff would decrease at an average rate of 24 mm/degrees C and evapotranspiration would increase at an average rate of 21 mm/degrees C with rising air temperature in the future. The impacts of increased air temperature on hydrological processes are mainly due to changes in frozen ground. The thickening of the active layer of the frozen ground increases the soil storage capacity, leading to decreased runoff and increased evapotranspiration. When the active layer depth increases by 1 cm, annual runoff decreases by approximately 1.3 mm, and annual evapotranspiration increases by approximately 0.9 mm. In addition, the shift from permafrost to seasonal frozen ground increases groundwater infiltration, which decreases surface runoff. Compared to that over the past 50 years, the effect of increased air temperature on the frozen ground in the upper Heihe River Basin will be greater in the future, which would result in a faster reduction in runoff in the future considering the effects of global warming.

AB Understanding the space-time structure and characteristics of drought is crucial for drought risk mitigation and forecasting efforts. In this paper, the drought events are identified by an improved 3-dimensional clustering algorithm. The 3-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI3) is calculated based on the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) dataset from January 1966 to December 2015 to construct the longitude-latitudetime space. The characteristics of these identified events are described by a series of indicators such as duration, severity, intensity, affected area, centroids and track path after which the spatial pattern and temporal evolution are studied. In addition, the Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Temperature Condition Index (TCI) are also included to investigate the possible impact of drought on the vegetation health. Results show that a total of 60 persisting drought events for at least 3 months have been identified in Central Asia. The most severe drought event occurred between May 1974 and January 1976 with a duration of 21 months and an affected area of 5.77 million km(2). Most events have a duration between 3 and 5 months. In addition, the droughts in Central Asia tend to have an east-west trajectory. Seasonally, the study area experienced more drought months in spring and summer. During the recent 35 years, there has been a slowly increasing thermal stress and a significantly decreasing soil moisture stress that causes an overall decreasing drought stress on vegetation health.

AB A multivariate stochastic soil moisture (SM) estimation approach based on a Gaussian-mixture nonstationary hidden Markov model (GM-NHMM) is introduced in this study to spatially disaggregate the AMSR2 SM data for multiple locations in the Yongdam dam watershed in South Korea. Rainfall and air temperature are considered as additional predictors in the proposed modeling framework. In GM-NHMM, a six-state model is constructed with three predictors representing an unobserved state associated with SM. It is clearly seen that the rainfall predictor plays a substantial role in achieving the overall predictability. Using weather variables (i.e., rainfall and temperature) can be effective in picking up some of the predictability of local SM that is not captured by the AMSR2 data. On the other hand, larger scale dynamic features identified from the AMSR2 data seem to facilitate the identification of regional spatial patterns of SM. The efficiency of the proposed model is compared with that of an ordinary regression model (OLR) using the same predictors. The mean correlation coefficient of the proposed model is about 0.78, which is significantly greater than that of the OLR at about 0.49. The proposed GM-NHMM method not only provides a better representation of the observed SM than the OLR model but also preserves the spatial coherence across all stations reasonably well.

AB Understanding changes in water quality over time and landscape and anthropogenic factors affecting them are of paramount importance to human and ecosystem health. We analyzed the seasonal trends of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand, and total suspended solid (SS) in the Han River Basin (HRB) of South Korea using the Mann-Kendall test. We explored the effects of anthropogenic (land cover and population) and natural factors (topography and soil) on the trends by using Moran's Eigenvector based spatial filtering regressions at four different spatial scales. Water quality of the HRB generally improved from the early 1990s to 2016 with decreasing summer nutrient and winter SS concentrations. Water quality trends were spatially autocorrelated with distinct spatial variations within the basin. Some stations close to the Seoul metropolitan area, however, still exhibited poor water quality conditions. Approximately 20-70 percent of spatial variation of different water quality trends were explained by some combination of current agricultural land cover, forest land cover, % area covered by water, change in those land covers and slope variations. The 100 m buffer and one-kilometer upstream scale analyses generally showed higher explanatory power than the sub-watershed scale analyses, while the effect of seasons differed for different parameters. The significant factors in each regression model typically differed among different scales but not among different seasons of the same scale. The spatial filtering approach removed the residual spatial autocorrelation and thus significantly increased the explanatory power of water quality trend models.

AB Rainfall event simulation can be very useful in many hydrological and hydraulic practices such as darn design. The aim of this study is to propose a new single-site stochastic model for generating daily rainfall events. The model has two components: Copula-based joint simulation of rainfall characteristics and rainfall temporal pattern simulation. Compared with prevailing stochastic rainfall models, this new model can not only preserve the dependence relationship between rainfall duration and rainfall depth by using Copula functions, but also take different temporal rainfall patterns that can cause various hydrological responses of watersheds into consideration. Additionally, the internal clustering validation index is introduced in this study to objectively determine the number of representative rainfall patterns in this model. Lastly, a framework is designed to apply the developed stochastic model to 39 gauged meteorological stations in Zhejiang Province, East China and to extend its application to one ungauged site for validation. The final validation results were sound and indicated that the developed stochastic model is robust and can be applied at both gauged stations and ungauged sites for generating long rainfall records.

AB Equitable distribution of agricultural and ecological water is a great challenge, which has important implications for food safety, with models required to calculate agricultural economic losses caused through protection of the ecological basic flow of rivers. A new model has been used to calculate agricultural economic losses caused by river ecological basic flow in the Baoji Section of the Weihe River, which is the largest tributary of the Yellow River, China. Results show that agricultural economic losses were negatively correlated to high levels of water runoff, with the agricultural water sector often unable to safeguard river ecological basic flow systems when annual food safety guarantee levels of 400 kg per person were met. Water-saving measures could be used to help protect river ecological basic flow, based on policies of agricultural ecological compensation, water rights transactions and encouraging the public to employ appropriate water-saving measures. However, whilst recommendations from this study enabled the agricultural water department to decrease economic losses and improve food safety guarantee levels, they could not provide full protection of river ecological basic flow.

AB Traditional methods for characterizing horizontally anisotropic aquifers are all based on pumping tests. In this paper, we present a new method for the identification of horizontal anisotropy using cross-hole slug tests, which is much more easily accessible comparing to pumping tests. Through scaler transform, an anisotropic medium was converted into an equivalent isotropic medium. When applying the analytical solutions derived for isotropic media to interpret cross-hole slug tests performed in anisotropic media, the estimated transmissivity is the geometrical mean of the anisotropic transmissivity tensor, regardless of sampling direction. However, the apparent storativity calculated from different observation wells, is equal to the true storativity scaled by a factor defined by the formation anisotropy. Thus, anisotropy can be resolved through apparent storativity that bears directional information. The proposed method was first validated by a numerical experiment and then applied to field data. It was found that the tensor results obtained by this new method with cross-hole slug tests are consistent with that obtained by applying the classical Papadopulos' method with cross-hole pumping tests conducted in the same wells. When applied to heterogeneous media, tensor results produced by the new method may be subject to considerable errors. This is because the results are strongly sensitive to the connectivity between measurement boreholes and the formation medium. To reduce the error level, responses from a large number of observation wells located in various directions around the source well are needed. In addition to the adopted KGS solution for confined aquifers, the proposed methodology can be applied to incorporate other analytical methods for a variety of aquifer types, as long as the characteristic relationship between the measure scale and the aquifer storativity can be established.

AB We use synoptic surveys of stream discharge, stable isotopes, and dissolved noble gases to identify the source of groundwater discharge to the Verde River in central Arizona. The Verde River more than doubles in discharge in Mormon Pocket over a 1.4 km distance that includes three discrete locations of visible spring input to the river and other diffuse groundwater inputs. A detailed study of the Verde River between Mormon Pocket and the USGS Clarkdale Gage was conducted to better constrain the location of groundwater inputs, the geochemical signature and constrain the source of groundwater input. Discharge, water quality parameters (temperature, pH, specific conductance, and dissolved oxygen), stable isotopes (delta O-18 and delta H-2), noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe), and radon (Rn-222) from river water were collected. Groundwater samples from springs and wells in the area were collected and analyzed for tracers measured in the stream along with some additional analytes (major ions, strontium isotopes (Sr-87/Sr-86), carbon-14, delta C-13, and tritium). Groundwater isotopic signature is consistent with a regional groundwater source. Groundwater springs discharging to the river have a depleted stable isotopic signature indicating recharge source up to 1000 m higher than the discharge location in the Verde River and are significantly fresher than stream water. Spring water has a radiocarbon age of several thousand years and some areas have tritium less than the laboratory reporting level or low concentrations of tritium (1.5 TU). The strontium isotopes indicate groundwater interaction with tertiary volcanic rock and Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Along the study reach with distance downstream, Verde stream water chemistry shows increased Rn-222, freshening, increased He-4, and isotopic depletion with distance downstream. We estimated total groundwater discharge by inverting a stream transport model against Rn-222 and discharge measured in the stream. The salinity, He-4, and stable isotope composition of discharging groundwater was then estimated by fitting modeled values to observed in-stream values. Estimated groundwater inflow to the stream was well within the ranges observed in springs, indicating that the main source of streamflow is deep, regional groundwater. These results show that synoptic surveys of environmental tracers in streams can be used to estimate the isotopic composition and constrain the source of groundwater discharging to streams. Our data provide direct field evidence that deep, regional groundwater discharge can be a significant source of streamflow generation in arid, topographically complex watersheds.

AB The shortage of water resources and the increasing competition among water users have highlighted the importance of the water allocation problem. Water availability is crucial for water resource allocation and changes frequently, leading to the necessity to predict available water. This paper develops a framework aimed to plan regional water allocations under different representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios using an interval parameter conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) two-stage stochastic programming model. This framework combines prediction and optimization to reflect climate change, the uncertainty of water system and the coordination between water resources allocation and risk. The feasibility and practicality of the framework are demonstrated by its application in a real-world case study in the Lower Songhua River Basin in northeast China. Comparison between the results of the developed model and actual conditions show that 11.61 x 10(8) m(3) volume of water supply can be saved after optimization, indicating that the developed model tends to allocate water in a more efficient way. The ratio of surface water to groundwater is reduced from 2:1 to 1.62:1. The proposed model has practical relevance for saving water and alleviating groundwater overexploitation. The approach is applicable to most areas with severe water shortages and groundwater overexploitation, and decision makers can determine the appropriate options for water resources allocation based on risk preferences and actual conditions.

AB Land use changes may modify ecohydrological processes in soil, altering groundwater quantity and quality in arid and semi-arid regions. The effects of land use change were well documented on flatlands, but the effect of rooting depth on groundwater recharge is poorly understood. This study is to evaluate how conversion of shallow-rooted to deep-rooted vegetation affects groundwater recharge at different landscape positions (i.e. tableland, upslope, midslope, and downslope). Two adjacent transects were selected for a paired plot design: one was covered with shallow-rooted perennial grasses and the other was planted with deep-rooted apple trees or apricot trees in 1990s. Soil cores (as deep as 13-25 m) were collected at each of the four landscape positions along the two transects for the determination of soil water contents, root distributions, and soil tritium contents. Groundwater recharge rates beneath shallow-rooted vegetation were determined from the tritium peak method, and that beneath deep-rooted vegetation were calculated by subtracting the annual soil water deficit from recharge rates beneath shallow-rooted vegetation. Results show that, there is no significant difference in groundwater recharge between the four landscape positions under shallow-rooted vegetation (p > 0.05); however, there is a substantial difference between different slope positions along the other transect (p < 0.05). Cross comparison between the two transects show that conversion from the shallow-rooted to deep-rooted vegetation resulted in a significant reduction of groundwater recharge (p < 0.05) which reduced to virtually zero when the rooting depth is deeper than 15 m. Therefore, we conclude that rooting depth is a major control of groundwater recharge. This study is the first attempt to evaluate the effect of deep-rooted vegetation in the deep unsaturated zone on groundwater recharge on hillslopes with terraces, having important implications to afforestation and to understanding ecohydrological processes in natural ecosystems.

AB Soil water infiltration can be described with the quasi-analytical Haverkamp et al. (1994) equation, defined by the hydraulic conductivity (K-s), sorptivity (S) and the beta parameter. K-s and S are commonly estimated from the transient cumulative infiltration curve, using a constant beta value. The objective of this work was to study the influence of beta on the estimation of K-s and S. The study was first performed on synthetic 1-D infiltration curves generated at different infiltration times for loam sandy, loamy and silty soils, and next extrapolated to a 3-D loam synthetic soil and on 10 infiltrations curves measured on the field with a disc infiltrometer on different types of soils. The infiltration measurements lasted between 600 and 900 s. The results showed that, while early infiltration times (i.e. 100 s) promoted good estimations for S, longer infiltrations (i.e. 1.000 s) were required to estimate accurately K-s. Only very long infiltration (i.e. 10.000 s) allowed defining the actual beta value. A similar behaviour was observed for the 3-D infiltration measurements. Except for f, significant relationships (R-2 = 0.99) were obtained between the K-s and S of the three theoretical soils and the corresponding values calculated by optimizing the three hydraulic parameters on 2.000 s 1-D infiltration curves. The large confidence interval observed in beta (between 0.3 and 2.0) resulted from the fact that beta had a small effect on the infiltration curve. A significant relationship (R-2 = 0.99) was also obtained between the K-s and S optimized from the experimental curves using a beta = 1.1 and the corresponding values obtained by simultaneous optimization of the three hydraulic parameters. These results demonstrated that S and K-s can be accurately estimated using a constant beta and that downward infiltration is not an appropriate procedure to estimate beta.

AB Natural soils and aquifers are inherently heterogenous and chemical transport through them is anomalous characterized by an early arrival followed by a persistent tail. How to describe such anomalous phenomena has been an interest and, as a result, a number of approaches have been proposed over the past few decades. Among others, the fractional advection-dispersion equation (FADE) is a model able to describe anomalous transport when the dispersion is regional rather than local as presumed in the classical advection-dispersion equation. Practical application of FADE needs numerical solutions, which is challenging because its spatial discretization gives rise to a full coefficient matrix. In this paper, we propose a Lattice Boltzmann model to solve the two-dimensional FADE. Given that the anomalous dispersion in soils and aquifers is hydrodynamic and caused by spatial variation in water velocity across the pore space and that the chemical plume spreads preferentially along the mean water-flow direction, the dispersion coefficient and the order of the fractional derivative should be both anisotropic. The anisotropies are solved by the two-relaxation time Lattice Boltzmann model using different relaxation parameters in different directions. Compared with existing numerical methods for the FADE, the proposed model has advantages that it is explicit, second-order accurate in both time and space, mass-conservative, and free of numerical dispersion; its stability is independent of dispersion coefficient. We verify the model against the analytical solution of a benchmark problem and then apply it to simulate Cl- movement in a tracer experiment conducted on an up-catchment hillslope. The results show that the FADE with backward skewness can reproduce the breakthrough curves measured from the experiment.

AB The regulating function is the least understood but probably most valuable service provided by an ecosystem. To estimate the impact of externalities on the regulating function of a wetland, we modelled the interdependence between activities that affect wetland characteristics and land utilization patterns. Nature-based solutions (NBS) can provide benefits for society, the economy and nature. The NBS solution for wetland bioremediation is proposed through a combination of ecosystem value provided by nature-based or artificial arable land. We constructed a model to simulate the dynamic spatial and temporal changes in the regulating function of a wetland to study the impact of agricultural and fishing activities on the functions and services of a wetland ecosystem. The model was used to determine the relationship between land use change, wetland range, water quality, and fish stocks. Huangqihai Lake (HQHL) is a relatively isolated lake in an area interlaced with agriculture and pasture zones. From 1973 to 2014, the "shrinkage" of the water area of HQHL approached 60%. Under the influence of humans and natural disturbances, the HQHL wetland faced enormous ecological risks, water pollution, area reduction, sharp biodiversity reduction, and fish extinction. The phosphorus (P) concentration seems to be a key factor affecting both the reed growth in the nearshore areas of the Huangqihai Lake wetland and the breeding of phytoplankton in the core lake water area. Dividing this value by the 25,821 ha of the core wetland area affected by the reclamation, the cost per unit of lost fish production is USD$166/ha/yr. After deducting the externalities of the fishery, the net sustainable income from the conversion is USD$1717/ha. The spatial distribution of nutrient load externalities varies with the use of wetlands. In terms of fishery value, the additional nutrient load associated with the conversion of wetland uses would result in a reduction of at least 8% of the maximum sustainable yield. The conversion of wetland uses resulted in the loss of nutrient buffering functions. To compensate for the farmland's nutrient load buffer service, the government should provide arable land farmers USD$8.1 M/yr. It is theoretically feasible to implement an ecosystem service payment system that can effectively compensate for the loss of nutrient buffer function caused by the conversion of wetlands. The approach based on BNS we described may also have value in other ecosystems where regulatory functions include similar mechanisms.

AB The atmospheric water supply and demand dynamics determine a region's potential water resources. The hydrologic ratios, such as, aridity index, evaporation ratio and runoff coefficients are useful indicators to quantify the atmospheric water dynamics at watershed to regional scales. In this study, we developed a modeling framework using a machine learning approach to predict hydrologic ratios for watersheds located in contiguous United States (CONUS) by utilizing a set of climate, soil, vegetation, and topographic variables. Overall, the proposed modeling framework is able to simulate the hydrologic ratios at watershed scale with a considerable accuracy. The concept of non-parametric elasticity was applied to study the potential influence of the estimated hydrologic ratios on various drought characteristics (resilience, vulnerability, and exposure) for river basins located in CONUS. Spatial sensitivity of drought indicators to hydrologic ratios suggests that an increase in hydrologic ratios may result in augmentation of magnitude of drought indicators in majority of the river basins. Aridity index seems to have higher influence on drought characteristics in comparison to other hydrologic ratios. It was observed that the machine learning approach based on random forests algorithm can efficiently estimate the spatial distribution of hydrologic ratios provided sufficient data is available. In addition to that, the non-parametric based elasticity approach can identify the potential influence of hydrologic ratios on spatial drought characteristics.

AB Sorption is an important means for pollutant migration in aquatic environments and an important mechanism of pollutant transfer and transformation. Thus, understanding the sorption/desorption of organic pollutants in an aquatic environment is vital to predicting pollutant fate. In this study, Bisphenol A (BPA) was selected as the target pollutant for an investigation of sorption characteristics on three sediments in the Lanzhou section of the Yellow River, with examination of sorption thermodynamic parameters and the effects of temperature, pH, and sediment particle size. Sorption is described well by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, occurring at two stages, fast (0-6 h) and slow (6-16 h), with equilibrium reached within 16 h. The results suggested that the intraparticle diffusion was dominant in the sorption process. Sorption thermodynamics was nonlinear, fitting well with the Freundlich isotherm model. Physical sorption is the likely mechanism, combining the contributions of pi-pi interaction and hydrophobic interaction. Thermodynamic parameter analysis showed that Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy were less than zero, showing that it is spontaneous, exothermic, and chaos-decreasing. Among tested influence parameters, pH values, ionic strengths, temperatures, and particle sizes were found to considerably influence the sorption of BPA. Sorption capacity decreased as sediment particle size increased and as pH increased. Sorption capacity increased with increasing Ca2+ and decreased with increasing Na+. The results have important implications regarding the impact of sorption/desorption at different environmental factors and fate of BPA in Yellow River.

AB An empirical (geo)statistical modelling scheme is developed to address the challenges of modelling the severity and distribution of groundwater droughts given their spatially and temporally heterogeneous nature and given typically highly irregular groundwater level observations in space and time. The scheme is tested using GWL measurements from 948 observation boreholes across the Chalk aquifer (UK) to estimate monthly groundwater drought status from 1960 to 2013. For each borehole, monthly GWLs are simulated using empirical mixed models where the fixed effects are based on applying an impulse response function to the local monthly precipitation. Modelled GWLs are standardised using the Standardised Groundwater Index (SGI) and the monthly SGI values interpolated across the aquifer to produce spatially distributed monthly maps of SGI drought status for 54 years for the Chalk. The mixed models include fewer parameters than comparable lumped parameter groundwater models while explaining a similar proportion (more than 65%) of GWL variation. In addition, the empirical modelling approach enables confidence bounds on the predicted GWLs and SGI values to be estimated without the need for prior information about catchment or aquifer parameters. The results of the modelling scheme are illustrated for three major episodes of multi-annual drought (1975-1976; 1988-1992; 2011-2012). They agree with previous documented analyses of the groundwater droughts while providing for the first time a systematic, spatially coherent characterisation of the events. The scheme is amenable to use in near real time to provide short term forecasts of groundwater drought status if suitable forecasts of the driving meteorology are available.

AB Changes in hydrological processes in large watersheds may heavily impact the dynamics of downstream aquatic ecosystems such as lakes and reservoirs. In general, simple approaches that neglect the spatial heterogeneity of watersheds impede understanding of the many processes occurring in these downstream aquatic ecosystems. In most cases, observed river discharges are used as the boundary condition for lake/reservoir modeling, which limits analyses of different situations and of areas that are ungauged or water bodies with little data available. Therefore, coupling hydrological models with hydrodynamic models seems to be a promising approach to allow one to understand how catchment features (e.g., land use, topography) and river discharges impact the dynamic patterns, including local circulation patterns, water levels and water quality in large water bodies in response to basin-wide forcing factors. In this study, we used a complex, spatially explicit, integrated approach to assess the hydrological responses to external forcing factors such as wind and river discharges, in the hydrodynamics of a large shallow subtropical lake. A large-scale integrated system composed of several sub-watersheds and a lake was analyzed by coupling a large-scale hydrological model with a hydrodynamic model. Our findings indicated that (i) the integrated model improved the capacity for representing the spatial and temporal variability of lake water-surface levels; (ii) the main hydrodynamic processes (water levels and flow structure) are controlled on a seasonal scale (months) by the river discharges, and on a short time scale (days) by wind influence (intensity and direction); and (iii) the modeling strategy allowed evaluation of anthropogenic stressors such as irrigation withdrawals on lake levels. This approach is an attempt to develop a physically based management model to simulate complex systems as a whole, allowing one to understand the main factors controlling the hydrodynamic processes and water levels, and accounting for internal (e.g., recirculation, horizontal mixing) and external factors (e.g., anthropogenic stressors, irrigation).

AB A probabilistic approach is presented to assess the performance validity of the empirical Curve Number (CN) and physically-based Green and Ampt (G&A) rainfall-runoff methods in the SWAT model. Specifically, the effects of modeling uncertainties on characterization of the hydrologic budgets and streamflow regimes at various spatial scales and upstream land use conditions are investigated. A Bayesian total uncertainty assessment framework, which explicitly accounts for uncertainties from model parameters, inputs, structure, and measurement data, was employed to explore uncertainties in streamflow simulation using SWAT with different rainfall-runoff methods in a mixed-land use watershed. While the models were trained for streamflow estimation only at the watershed outlet, the performances of the models were compared at different stream locations within the watershed. At the watershed outlet, the CN method had a slightly better, but not significant, performance in terms of streamflow error statistics. Similar results were obtained for the predominantly forested and agricultural tributaries. However, in tributaries with higher percentage of developed land, G&A outperformed the CN method in simulating streamflow based on various performance metrics. In general, the 95% prediction intervals from the models with G&A method covered a higher percentage of observed streamflow especially during the high flow events. However, they were approximately 20-45% wider than the corresponding 95% prediction intervals from the CN methods. Using 95% prediction interval for estimated flow duration curves, results indicated that the models with CN methods underestimated high flow events especially in tributaries with highly developed land use. However, the CN methods generated higher water yields to streams than the G&A method. The results of this study have important implications for the selection and application of appropriate rainfall-runoff methods within complex distributed hydrologic models particularly when simulating hydrologic responses in mixed-land use watersheds. In the present study, while CN and G&A methods in the SWAT model performed similarly at the outlet of a mixed-land use watershed, G&A captured the internal processes more realistically. The subsequent effects on the representation of internal hydrological processes and budgets are discussed.

AB In predicting how droughts and hydrological cycles might change in a changing climate, change of pan evaporation (E-pan) is one crucial element to be understood. The derived partial differential (PD) form of the PenPan equation is a prevailing attribution approach worldwide. However, small biases exist and the application of PD method is limited within the derivation of partial differential form of the equation, which impede the attribution analysis in hydrology. Here we designed a series of numerical experiments by detrending each climatic variable, i.e., an experimental detrending (ED) approach, to attribute changes of E-pan over China. We compared the attribution results using these two methods and further analyzed the plausible advantages of ED approach. The comparison shows that both ED approach and PD method perform well in attributing changes of E-pan and to the input meteorological variables in China over 1960-2017. The first advantage of ED approach is that it can help make robust adjustment for the PD method in attribution analysis. Another advantage lies in its ability to attribute to the observed meteorological variables in China, when the PD method fails to quantify the contribution of relative humidity and air temperature in net radiation in E-pan attribution analysis. We highlight that the ED approach is recommended in attribution analysis for hydrologic research. Together with the adjusted PD method, both methods can assist a better understanding and prediction of water-energy cycles change in a changing climate.

AB Water quality networks usually do not include observations on a continuous timescale over a long period. Statistical models that use streamflow and mechanistic models that use meteorological information and land-use are commonly employed to develop continuous streamflow and nutrient records. Given the availability of long meteorological records, mechanistic models have the potential to develop continuous water quality records, but such predictions suffer from systematic biases on both streamflow and water quality constituents. This study proposes a multivariate bias correction technique based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) - a dimension reduction technique based on multivariate multiple regression - that reduces the bias in both streamflow and loadings simultaneously by preserving the cross-correlation. We compare the performance of CCA with linear regression (LR) in removing the systematic bias from the SWAT model forced with precipitation and temperature for three selected watersheds from the Southeastern US. First, we compare the performance of CCA with LR in removing the bias in SWAT model outputs in predicting the observed streamflow and total nitrogen (TN) loadings from the Water Quality Network (WQN) dataset. We also evaluate the potential of CCA in removing the bias in SWAT model predictions at daily and monthly time scales by considering the LOADEST model predicted loadings as the predictand for CCA and LR. Evaluation of CCA with the observed dataset and at daily and streamflow time scales shows that the proposed multivariate technique not only reduces the bias in the cross-correlation between streamflow and loadings, but also improves the joint probability of estimating observed streamflow and loadings. Potential implications of the proposed bias-correction technique, CCA, in water quality forecasting and management are also discussed.

AB This study establishes an innovative systematic optimization model for megacity flood mitigation by combining multiple Low Impact Development (LID) devices, taking into consideration a Benefit-Cost (B/C) Analysis. The contributions provided by this study include: (1) analysis of flooding consequences on a developing megacity; (2) development of a technical approach enabling an automatic and effective optimization process, linking with an embedded Storm Water Management Model (SWMM); and (3) proposal of adaptive solutions using a combined layout design scheme. Our investigation sets the Benefit/Cost ratio as the objective function to deal with flooding in all return periods (RPs). The decision variables correspond to the allocated areas and quantity of LID devices, including porous pavements, bioretention cells, infiltration trenches, rain barrels, vegetable swales, green roofs, and tree boxes. Under such layout, the flooding loss was simulated with SWMM, and the optimal solution was solved by employing a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm. Min-Sheng Community in Taipei is chosen as a study area for demonstrating the applicability of the developed model. Results show that the B/C ratio of identified optimal design can reach 1.448, with green roofs and bioretention cells as main devices, and rain barrels and porous pavements as secondary supplies. Regarding rainfalls in all RPs, the peak flows and delay of peak times at Fu-Yuan Pumping Station can decrease significantly in the range of 5.75-29.80% and 12.50-20%, respectively; and 9.52%-23.49% and 12.50%-37.5% at the subcatchments. The efficiency of flood detention is higher for low RPs than high RPs, while the time-delay ability is smaller.

AB Droughts cause significant socio-economic and environmental impacts, so it has become an extremely important element in decision-making within water resource systems. For this reason, the research in this field has increased considerably over the last few decades. In order to be capable of making early decisions and reducing drought impacts, it is necessary to predict the occurrence of such events months or even years in advance. In this sense, various methods have been used to predict the occurrence of droughts. At present, seasonal forecast data can be used to forecast meteorological, hydrological, agricultural and operational droughts. However, the seasonal forecast data of these dynamical ocean-atmosphere coupled models must be analyzed in an exhaustive way, since it is known that these models may not adequately represent the climatic variability at river basin scale. Hence, this paper presents a new methodology for assessing the skill of a climate forecasting system in order to predict the occurrence of droughts by using contingency tables. The indices obtained from the contingency tables are necessary to perform the analysis of the predictive ability of the model in a semi-distributed way. All this taking into account the intensity of droughts using different scenarios based on the threshold below which it is considered to be in drought. Finally, a single value is obtained to determine the predictive ability of the forecasting model for the entire basin. The proposed methodology is applied to the Jucar river basin in Spain. It has been found that the analyzed forecast model shows better results than those obtained using an autoregressive model. Further work is needed to enhance climate forecasting from the perspective of water resources management, however, it should be mentioned that this type of data could be used for drought forecasting, allowing possible mitigation measures.

TI Prediction of pollutant remediation in a heterogeneous aquifer in

   concentration data
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English

AB For large contaminant plumes in groundwater, Pump and Treat (PT) is usually applied, not only to remediate the aquifer, but also to control the spreading of the plume. The aquifer structure, as well as the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume, are typically subject to uncertainty. This uncertainty can highly effect the remediation predictions. Geostatistical tools combined with Monte-Carlo simulations can be used to quantify those uncertainties and to provide a more established basis for decision makers regarding the remediation strategy. Here, we focus on a case study of a polluted aquifer and inspect its response to remediation by a PT scheme using two pumping wells. The aquifer structure is combined of 4 lithological units and indicator realizations were generated using a modified sequential indicator simulation (SIS) approach. Then, the initial plume prior to remediation was estimated by a forward predictive model. As a result, each realization had a unique spatial distribution of the contaminant at the onset of the remediation. Spatio-temporal measurements of head and contaminant concentration were used to screen inappropriate realizations. Our results have shown that conditioning the realizations to the head alone has a minor effect upon the uncertainty regarding the remediation efficiency (RE). On the other hand, by conditioning the realizations to both head and concentrations, the uncertainty was reduced by more than 35% in terms of the standard deviation of RE.
   Risk analysis for the migration of the plume showed that the ability of the current configuration of the remediation wells to control the plume is limited to the top layers of the aquifer. Thus, with the present monitoring network, there is a significant risk that the plume will migrate downstream towards production wells, without being noticed.

AB Multiple optima seriously confine the solution accuracy of stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) for non-concave maximization models of reservoir operation. To address the problem, a two-stage optimization algorithm combining traversing and search is proposed to obtain an optimal decision at each state combination. Single or multiple promising regions where a local optimal solution may exist are identified through coarse traversing in the whole feasible region, and a local search algorithm is used to local optimization in each promising region. Energy maximization model is used to analyze the multiple optima problem and test the method. In the model, quadratic and concave penalty functions are used to address the total power constraint for smaller shortages and fewer shortage periods respectively. The total power constraint increases the probability of multiple local optima existence and intensifies the difficulty in finding optimal decisions. The proposed model and method are applied to the cascaded reservoir system on middle-lower Lancang River in China. Numerical results show that the total power constraint is well addressed, the computing time can be reduced by more than 50% using the two-stage algorithm in getting operating rules with similar performance comparing to only traversing, and the multi-point search algorithm is superior to traversing and single point search in solving the proposed model.

DE Discharge measurement; Streamgauging; Rating curves; Rivers; Velocity
   measurements
AB Traditional methods for the calculation of rating curves from measurements of water level and discharge are criticised as being limited and complicated to implement, such that manual methods are still often used. Two methods for automatic computation are developed using least-squares approximation, one based on polynomials and the other on piecewise-continuous splines. Computational problems are investigated and procedures recommended to overcome them. Both methods are found to work well and once the parameters for a gauging station have been determined, rating data can be processed automatically. For some streams, ephemeral changes of resistance may be important, evidenced by scattered or loopy data. For such cases, the approximation methods can be used to generate a rating envelope as well, allowing the routine calculation also of maximum and minimum expected flows. Criticism is made of current shift curve practices. Finally, the approximation methods allow the specification of weights for the data points, enabling the filtering of data, especially decreasing the importance of points with age and allowing the computation of a rating curve for any time in the past or present.

AB Due to the significant costs associated with stream health monitoring, hydrological modeling is widely used to calculate ecologically-relevant hydrologic indices to better understand the overall condition of streams within large and diverse watersheds. However, hydrologic modeling's ability to replicate these indices is limited, especially when calibrating models by optimizing a single objective function or when selecting a single optimal solution. Hence, this study evaluates the performance of multi-objective model calibration in representing 167 hydrologic indices of ecological interest using the median values of different Pareto-optimal solution sets. For this purpose, two strategies based on three Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiencies (NSE), and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) with explicit hydrograph partitioning, were implemented. Additionally, the k-means clustering technique was employed to define subsets of Pareto-optimal solutions representing high, medium, and low flow conditions. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was set up for the Honeyoey Creek-Pine Creek Watershed, located in Michigan, USA, and was calibrated using a single streamflow gauging station and the recently proposed multi-objective optimization algorithm - Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III (NSGA-III). The results show that the NSE- and RMSE-based calibration strategies can represent 128 and 123 indices within a range of +/- 30% relative errors, respectively. In addition, the results of this study demonstrated that using different set of solutions, instead of a single optimal solution, introduces more flexibility in the predictability of different hydrologic indices of ecological interest. Moreover, it is suggested that a multi-objective calibration approach allows the systematic identification of groups of poorly represented and closely related indices. Knowing these poorly represented indices would facilitate the formulation of additional objective functions intended to improve model performance or to detect structural inadequacies.

ID SUSPENDED SEDIMENT; MODEL
AB Consideration is given to a novel approach for resuspension and control of sediment in reservoirs which nowadays and after more than six decades of research remains as the most serious technical problem faced by dam industry. Here, it is proposed the generation of mild surface waves in the reservoir which - because the physical nature of the waves, will spread throughout the reservoir. Then, by using a farm of point absorbers - or technology akin as used in ocean energy conversion, the energy transported by the waves can be transformed into a continuous injection of water flow in the riverbeds balancing the gravitational settling and then in the resuspension and control of sediment settlement. Utilizing a simplified physical model an estimation of the area of riverbed covered in comparison with the area of point absorber needed was derived as function of several parameters. Methods for wave generation were briefly discussed and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) simulations performed being in good agreement with the theoretical estimations. The proposed concept is presented as a promising alternative technique which can contribute to mitigate the serious global problem of land loss in the river deltas as well as increasing the storable capability and life of large dams.

AB Coastal bays with fresh submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) have been found to provide a favorable environment to shellfish (e.g., oysters). Significant variability in the spatial distribution and magnitude of SGD may occur because of subsurface heterogeneity. We investigated the relationship between stratigraphic controls (i.e. paleovalley systems) and the spatial distribution of SGD in relation to oyster reefs. In Copano Bay, South Texas, major oyster reefs have been shown to be oriented perpendicular to shore, along interfluves, and near paleovalley margins. A novel combination approach of radioactive geochemical tracers, stable isotopes, geophysical and petrophysical techniques were used to identify estuarine depositional environments for individual hydrogeologic characterization and evaluation of SGD distribution with implications to ecological features such as oyster reefs. A 1-km(2) area within a paleovalley system, in Copano Bay, yielded discernible differences in sediment type, apparent resistivity, and SGD rates among four different depositional environments: paleovalley, paleovalley margin, oyster reef and interfiuve. Electrical resistivity tomography revealed a direct connection between the oyster reef and the underlying, more permeable interfiuve, and the presence of a fresher SGD component in the subsurface. Measurements of SGD from stationary and mobile continuous radon-222 surveys across each depositional environment showed that, by and large, areas in proximity to reefs have larger SGD rates (62.6 +/- 11.3 cm/d in January and 28.7 +/- 10.8 cm/d in July) when compared to paleovalleys (31.9 +/- 8.9 cm/d in January and 19.5 +/- 7.2 cm/d in July). The role of depositional environments as hydrologic controls on SGD to oyster reefs revealed in this study is further confirmed by significant differences in stable and radioactive isotopes observed over small spatial scales offshore when compared to the entire estuary. Although constant mixing and radon-222 degassing of bay waters are likely altering the relationships between the different depositional environments and magnitude of SGD, this study provides an improved understanding of possible pathways of freshwater and solute inputs to oyster reefs for more informed decisions on reef restoration efforts.

AB Despite increasing knowledge on the spatio-temporal dynamics of river temperature, a master water quality variable, it remains a challenge to identify the landscape variables influencing thermal heterogeneity along entire river courses. The present study investigated the spatial heterogeneity of stream temperature (ST), and the role of landscape variables, at 20 locations along the 195 km course of the intensively managed lowland River Spree (NE Germany) over a period of nine months. Along the river, four distinct thermal sections were identified, created by thermal discontinuities induced by lakes and an urban area. Three approaches, namely heat budget modelling (estimating the unresolved residual heat flux), both in Eulerian and Lagrangian form, semi-empirical air2stream modelling, and statistical correlations were applied to quantify the observed thermal heterogeneity and the role of climatic (air temperature) and landscape variables (land use, lakes, stream azimuth). Urban areas and lakes were identified as heat sources (in summer), which induced ST discontinuities at different time scales (daily, monthly and during the entire study period). Statistical correlations showed that heat inputs and ST increased with increasing urban area and decreased with distance from lakes. Furthermore, comparison of observed STs and those simulated via the Lagrangian model revealed that heat advection was the dominant thermal process in a lake-influenced section and persisted over a distance of up to 20 km. Simulations showed that this effect could not be significantly diminished even by complete riparian shading along the section, as the sub-daily ST reduced by an average of only 1.5 degrees C. Hence, plantation of riparian buffers should be complemented with additional mitigation measures such as improving the groundwater table recharge, managing the temperature of urban discharges, to mitigate climate change impacts on ST.

AB In this study, we aim to characterise natural variability of water temperature in surface waters of the Tatra Mts. and determine the dominant factors controlling its spatial diversity and seasonal patterns. For this purpose, a total of 33 time series of water temperature representing lakes, vaucluse springs and streams were analysed using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The periodicity analysis were conducted with the Morlet wavelet on hourly sampled data covering a period of 5 years. The principal components analysis (PCA) has been applied to describe the relationships among variables and extract potential sources of water temperature variability. The results showed an extremely high heterogeneity in temporal patterns of water temperature fluctuations among streams when compared to lakes and vaucluse springs. Wavelet analysis of water temperature time series revealed the presence of seven different configurations of periodical patterns. The lowest variability was observed among vaucluse springs that are supplied by groundwaters. Temporal fluctuations of water temperature in lakes contained four different types of oscillations. Streams were among the most diversified in terms of water temperature patterns exhibiting low, medium and high frequency behaviour. The PCA analysis confirmed the dependence of water temperature on weather conditions, catchment characteristics and flow rate explaining 88.97% of the total variability in the data. The results obtained from this study emphasize the importance of continuous data collection for capturing the long-term dynamics and consistent temporal patterns in time series. The study also demonstrates that wavelet analysis is helpful to identify cyclical patterns in time series of water temperature, and therefore may be useful in the classification of thermal regimes in surface waters.

AB The groundwater contribution to streamflow along a lowland alluvial stream in Denmark was estimated using a variety of methods and at different spatial scales. At the point-scale (less than a few metres), groundwater discharge to the stream was measured using seepage meters. At the reach-scale (0.5-1.5 km), groundwater discharge to the stream was estimated using differential streamflow gauging. And at the catchment-scale ( > 1.5 km), groundwater discharge to the stream was estimated using hydrograph separation. The estimates of groundwater discharge obtained using point-scale measurements range from 12 to 41 cm/d which is lower than fluxes estimated at the reach-scale which range from 18 to 333 cm/d. This discrepancy was attributed to the partitioning of groundwater discharge into streambed seepage and bank seepage. On the other hand, the groundwater discharge estimates obtained using hydrograph separation were generally the highest and ranged from 194 to 289 cm/d. For this study, this discrepancy from the reach-scale estimates was attributed to the assumption that baseflow obtained using hydrograph separation represents groundwater discharge to the stream when part of the baseflow actually comes from artificial drainage systems. Anyhow, seepage meter measurements, differential streamflow gauging, and hydrograph separation showed similar trends. The increase in streamflow is mainly due to either groundwater discharge through the streambed and the banks in the lower part, or tile drainage discharge in the upper part of the catchment. Furthermore, estimation of uncertainty for the various groundwater discharge estimates showed that some of the flux estimates were insignificant compared with their propagated uncertainties. To this end, a novel method was developed to estimate the uncertainty of groundwater discharge estimates obtained by hydrograph separation. Overall, this paper shows that more than one method should be used to obtain a reliable estimate of groundwater discharge to a lowland alluvial stream from other discharge contributions such as tile drainage.

AB We used data from 109 surveyed cross sections at 34 reaches of New Zealand rivers ranging in bankfull width from 8 to 234 m, each with 4-13 measured flows, to compare regression-derived at-a-station hydraulic geometry (AHG) coefficients and exponents to the coefficients and exponents predicted by Dingman's (2007) analytical AHG relations. The analytical geometrical relations depend on measured values of 1) bankfull width, 2) bankfull maximum depth, and 3) a geometric exponent fit to the measured cross section. Because of data limitations and the lack of a generally applicable analytical hydraulic relation, the hydraulic relation is here represented by an empirical power-law relation between depth and velocity developed at each section. The fits between the quasi-analytical and empirical values of the AHG coefficients and exponents are highly statistically significant, with intercepts near 0 and slopes near 1, validating Dingman's original analytical relations. This confirmation of the physical basis underlying empirically-observed AHG relations, along with some statistically-significant relations among the quantities that determine AHG coefficients and exponents that are not predicted by theory, may be useful for estimating AHG relations from remotely-sensed or partial information.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB Due to the dynamic flow exchange between a stream and a connected water- table aquifer, a physically based hydrologic model is an important tool for the design of conjunctive use of surface and ground waters. It is needed to develop sound plans for sustainable use of the groundwater with minimal undesirable effects. This article reports an investigation of the component (module) that describes the stream-aquifer flow exchange in several groundwater simulators. The study indicates that the module may not have a solid physical basis when used in large-scale regional studies to estimate the stream-aquifer flow exchange. The component relies upon an empirical parameter known as the leakance coefficient. It is demonstrated that neglecting river penetration of the aquifer can lead to non-negligible errors in estimation of seepage. In addition the leakance coefficient (dimension inverse of a time) is not constant in time but varies with the conditions in the river and in the surrounding aquifer. A potential, practical and simple alternative is presented.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

DT Article
DE Evaporation; Lysimeters; Sand dams; Bare soil
AB Unlike evaporation from open water, the magnitude of evaporation from bare soil decreases as the water table falls. Bare soil evaporation studies have included field and laboratory experiments, mathematical formulations and semi-empirical models. However, there is only limited field information, especially concerning evaporation from bare sand. The semi-empirical approach of the FAO(1) Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56, which contains guidelines for computing crop water requirements, can be adapted for bare soil evaporation with a three stage process. The suitability of the FAO 56 approach for bare sand evaporation is investigated by installing lysimeters in sand dams. Sand dams are shallow groundwater storage systems, which are designed on the assumption of reduced evaporation as the water table falls. The field results from the lysimeters are simulated adequately by a water balance model based on FAO 56 with an additional component to represent both the difference between the variable saturation with depth, which occurs in practice, and the assumption in standard water balance models of a sudden change from dry to fully-saturated conditions at the water table. This study demonstrates and quantifies the reduction in bare soil evaporation compared to open water or cropped areas and confirms the validity of the three stage FAO semi-empirical approach.

AB In an unusual combined nested and paired catchment experiment in northern England, the 1.5-km(2) Coalbum catchment (90% mature plantation forest with a dense drainage ditch network) is paired with the 1.4-km(2) Flothers catchment (64% peat grassland), both being nested within the 6.9-km(2) Throssburn mixed forest and peat grassland catchment. In only the second such UK quantification, a 100% forest cover reduces annual runoff relative to a 100% grassland cover by 24%. The study provides rare field (as opposed to model) evidence showing that the impact of land use on flood peaks is moderated by catchment saturation and by extreme rainfall. Flood frequency curves differ according to land use at the smaller return periods but the data are not sufficient to confirm that the pattern extends to the highest floods. Against conventional expectation, flood peaks tend to be larger and flashier in the forest catchment, apparently the consequence of the forest ditching. Springtime monthly runoff/rainfall ratios in the peat grassland catchment may reach 100%, representing a seasonal sponge effect which is eliminated from the forest catchment through the effects of the ditches. Combination of the paired and nested catchments provides a highly unusual opportunity to show that, at the annual scale, the integrated catchment response can be obtained by combining the responses of the separate land covers according to the proportions of the catchment that they occupy, an assumption widely made but rarely, if ever, tested.

AB In this reply we further demonstrate and confirm that the main conclusion (namely, that the asymptotic limit of the acid dissolution capacity can lead to sharp dissolution fronts) in our recent publication in this journal is correct and valid. The basis of the incorrect critique in the comment is whether or not a physically-consistent velocity scale should be used in deriving the dimensionless partial differential equations of the reactive infiltration instability problem in fluid-saturated rocks. In addition, there is confusion in the comment between the conclusions drawn from results obtained using different time scales (such as a dissolution time scale and a much larger time scale than the dissolution time scale) in the process of describing the reactive infiltration instability problem, and using different mathematical transforms (such as a physically-consistent mathematical transform and a physically-inconsistent one) in the nondimensionalization of dimensional partial differential equations.

AB Physically based distributed hydrological models are useful for simulating the spatial distribution of hydrologic fluxes across the catchment under various climate and land cover change scenarios. However, complexities associated with their implementation at large scales make their applications limited. Previously, an equivalent cross-section (ECS) based distributed hydrological modelling approach was developed for first order sub-basins to reduce the computational time/effort. Here, the ECS approach is modified for semi-distributed hydrological modelling at the catchment scale. The modelling approach is implemented for a 314 km(2) McLaughlin catchment located in south-eastern New South Wales (NSW), Australia that consists of 822 first order sub-basins. A 26 year long streamflow record simulated using an ECS based modelling approach are compared against daily observed streamflow and four calibrated lumped conceptual hydrologic models, and found to be consistent. Further, the simulated actual evapotranspiration and soil moisture from the ECS approach are compared against the Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) model simulations and results found to be consistent. In addition, the temporal dynamics of simulated soil moisture from the ECS approach is consistent with the satellite derived European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) surface soil moisture data. In the ECS based semi-distributed modelling, all parameters are derived from the actual topographic and physiographic information of the catchment and none of the parameters is calibrated. Therefore, this approach has the advantage of simulating streamflow in ungauged catchments compared to lumped conceptual models. The impact of spatially distributed climatic forcing and land cover on soil moisture is investigated across four landforms (upslope, midslope, footslope and alluvial-flats) and at various soil depths. Our results show increase of mean soil moisture in shallow layers of upslope toward alluvial-flats. However, mean soil moisture in deeper horizons remained almost constant across all landforms. The variability of daily soil moisture at surface soil layers is higher than the deeper soil layers for all landforms. Our results illustrated that disaggregation of a catchment to a series of ECS at the scale of first order sub-basins, captures dynamics of soil moisture and actual evapotranspiration across the landscape and results are consistent with the climatology, land cover type, topography and soil hydraulic properties. Further, the use of ECS approach in the McLaughlin catchment reduced the number of computational units by 40 times in comparison to 3-d grid based distributed modelling setup.

AB The optimization of the mixed reservoir system, consisting of parallel and cascade reservoirs, is a complex issue due to its nonlinear storage curves, complex hydraulic connection and coordination. This paper aims to derive optimal operating rules for the flood control of large-scale mixed reservoir using a new algorithm known as weighted non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (WNSGA II), which could efficiently locate the Pareto front in the non-dominated region due to directed searching with the weighted crowding distance. A case study was performed in the Xijiang river basin in China, where there are eight flood control reservoirs and five flood control sections in four tributaries and the mainstream. Three scenarios, including conventional operating rules (COR), single-objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by genetic algorithm (PLO-GA), and multi-objective piecewise linear operating rules derived by WNSGA II (PLO-WNSGA II), are compared, and the resilience of three reservoir operating rules under inflow uncertainty is investigated as well. The results indicate that: (1) WNSGA II can locate non-dominated solutions more efficiently and provide better Pareto front than non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) due to the weighted crowding distance; (2) PLO-WNSGA II outperforms COR and PLO-GA for the control of basin-wide floods; and (3) PLO-WNSGA II is more resilient under inflow uncertainty. Therefore, PLO-WNSGA II is effective and efficient for the control of basin-wide floods in a mixed reservoir system.

AB The understanding of the impact of drought on the agricultural ecosystem is key to minimize drought-related yield losses. In this study, we analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought events in the North China Plain (NCP) based on the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and investigated the impact of drought on winter wheat and summer maize yields. The results indicate an overall drought and wetting trend during the winter wheat growing season in the Henan and Shandong provinces, respectively. A significant wetting trend was detected in the NCP during the summer maize growing season at the 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month scales. Moreover, the drought episodes clearly reveal that the drought pattern has changed from summer and autumn droughts in the 1980s, to autumn and winter droughts in the 1990s, and to winter and spring droughts in the recent decade. Our results also show that the annual variations in the detrended SPEI can explain extensive fluctuations associated with both winter wheat and summer maize yields in the NCP. Furthermore, considerable differences in the relationship between agricultural crop yields and the SPEI time series with different lags were observed; the most correlated time scale increases with the advancement of the winter wheat growth stage. The correlations between the winter wheat standardized yield residuals series (SYRS) and detrended SPEI in three subperiods are consistently high and stable, whereas a substantial decrease of the correlation was observed at all time scales for summer maize, except for the 1-month lag. Our findings can help to better understand the drought evolution in the NCP in recent decades and hence provide stakeholders with references for the design of future drought mitigation plans.

AB We analyze the diurnal cycle of maximum rainfall from similar to 300 TCs from March 2014 through February 2017, by cross-referencing the path of tropical cyclones (TCs) and high-resolution rainfall estimates from IMERG (Integrated Multi-satellitE Rainfall from GPM - Global Precipitation Measurement mission). IMERG is a gridded satellite product that offers high-resolution rainfall estimates at a spatiotemporal resolution of 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees every 30 min, which are particularly suitable for these analyses.
   Because of the nature of the data, we use circular statistics. Circular statistics allows us to account for the natural periodicity of a random variable such as the time of the day at which maximum rainfall from TCs occurs. We follow the non-parametric approach of Mixtures of Von Mises-Fisher distribution (MvMF), which enables an easy-to-interpret parameter identification of multimodal and anisotropic distributions of the TC-rainfall. We stratify our analysis by storm duration, maturity, and intensity, basin of origin, radial proximity to the center of the storm, and whether the storm is over the ocean or land.
   In general, and across all scales, we find that there are mainly two cycles of maximum TC-rainfall: one diurnal cycle with peaks at similar to 10 and similar to 22 h (local time), and one semi-diurnal cycle with peaks at similar to 2 and similar to 5 h (local time). Although in a smaller proportion, the latter exhibits a weak afternoon alternative, i.e., similar to 14 and similar to 18 h (local time).

AB The carbon and water cycles play an important role in ecosystem functioning and are linked to each other through different physical and biological processes. The hydroclimatic disturbances such as droughts affect both hydrological as well as the ecological processes. Increasing hydroclimatic disturbances under climate change will adversely affect the ecohydrological processes and hence, the assessment of the ecohydrological resilience and its controlling factors is important for the sustainability of the ecosystems. In this study, an assessment of the resilience of terrestrial ecosystems in India to hydroclimatic disturbances was carried out at the district (i.e. administrative division) scale. Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUEe), defined as the ratio of net primary productivity (NPP) to evapotranspiration, was used as an indicator of ecosystem functioning or its response to hydroclimatic disturbances. We found a large spatial variation in WUEe in India at district scale, which was significantly higher in lower Himalayan regions compared to rest of the country. Increasing trend in WUEe was found for central parts of the country. The resilience was measured in terms of the ratio of the WUEe under the dry conditions and the mean WUEe which indicates the ability to absorb hydroclimatic disturbance. Out of 634 districts considered for this study, only 241 (similar to 38%) districts were found resilient to dry conditions, whereas a significant reduction in WUEe was observed for some of the districts. The resilience at district scale indicates the cross-biomes response of ecosystems. In general, the forest dominated districts had higher resilience compared to districts dominated by other biome types. Also, districts having temperate climate were found having higher resilience. Out of 30 states and union territories (UTs) only 10 states had more than 50% resilient area. The results of this study highlight the need for better ecosystem management policies in the country.

AB To better understand the groundwater flow and chemistry in argillaceous formations, the dependency of transport parameters such as permeability, diffusion coefficient, and chemical osmotic efficiency on each of the chemical species dominant in groundwater must also be understood. Despite its importance, however, little is known about the dependence of transport parameters on different types of groundwater. Thus, we investigated transport parameters of Wakkanai mudstones using three different types of electrolyte solutions. Here, we report the relationship among the solution salt type, solute concentration, transport parameters, and pore structure characteristics. Wide ranges in osmotic efficiency and intrinsic permeability, 0.0035-0.14 and 1.19 x 10(-19) to 4.75 x 10(-18) m(2), respectively, reflect the difference in the solution composition based on the salt type, difference in solute concentration, and variation in the pore size distributions of Wakkanai mudstones. The effective diffusion coefficients with filtration effects, at 2.98 x 10(-11) to 5.92 x 10(-11) m(2) s(-1), vary depending on salt type, but remain invariant among samples, indicating no difference in fluid flow path associated with small values of osmotic efficiency. In contrast, the osmotic efficiencies are related to differences in salt concentrations. Our findings indicate that salt concentration and pore structure characteristics determine not only the semipermeability of the Wakkanai mudstones but also the diffusivity and permeability.

AB Contaminant source identification is a key problem in handling groundwater pollution events. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is used for the spatiotemporal identification of a point contaminant source in a sandbox experiment, together with the identification of the position and length of a vertical plate inserted in the sandbox that modifies the geometry of the system. For the identification of the different parameters, observations in time of solute concentration are used, but not of piezometric head data since they were not available. A restart version of the EnKF is utilized because it is necessary to restart the forecast from time zero after each parameter update. The results show that the restart EnKF is capable of identifying both contaminant source information and aquifer-geometry-related parameters together with an uncertainty estimate of such identification.

AB Colloidal-suspension flows in porous media occur in numerous areas of environmental, chemical and petroleum engineering. The main processes are capture and detachment of particles, yielding permeability decline. We developed a governing system of transport equations with particle detachment kinetics, where the detachment by high velocities is instant, due to flow incompressibility, and the detachment by decreasing the fluid salinity is delayed, due to micro-scale diffusion. The system allows for a semi-analytical solution for axi-symmetric low-salinity water injection with fines migration. The model exhibits instant fines mobilization at the beginning of injection by drag force, fines release with delay behind the salinity front by electrostatic force, and the interaction of two concentration waves. The model can be used for laboratory-based injectivity decline prediction during injection of water in aquifers and oilfields, where the injected and formation water compositions are different, and also for fines-migration during drilling fluid invasion.

AB An efficient method for nonlinear approximate solutions of the one-dimensional horizontal absorption equation is presented. The method pertains to a semi-infinite soil with uniform initial condition and constant soil water content at the beginning of a soil column. It does not make any prior assumptions about the form of the diffusivity function. The nonlinear solution is of simple combination of power and exponential functions and expresses in explicit form the distance as function of time and soil water content. It involves all the physical parameters and four additional fitting parameters which can be obtained by simple fitting procedure. Algebraic expressions that quantify the main infiltration process are derived from the basic equation. These include the sorptivity, the infiltration rate, the cumulative infiltration rate, and the wetting front. A comparison with exact, numerical and other analytical solutions validates the accuracy of the approximation and shows its advantage to other approximate solutions. The analytical expressions are used to predict experimental soil moisture profiles from simple measurements such as sorptivity, wetting front, and initial and final soil water contents. The method is applied to estimate soil hydraulic properties using horizontal water absorption experiments. The results of the parameter estimation procedure are compared to other existing results and show good agreements. The solution method is also tested to various diffusivity functions and its limitation is discussed in detail.

AB This study is an assessment of the changes in seasonal and monthly flow in seven catchments draining the northern Tien Shan Mountains in Central Asia over a period from the 1950s to the present day. The purpose is to provide a first assessment of the flow response to climate change in regionally important catchments given their contribution to the water resource. All the catchments have a natural flow regime, and are therefore sensitive to climate change, but differ in area, elevation and glacial extent. Trends in flow were characterised using the Mann-Kendall test for standard meteorological seasons and individual months for mean flow, five flow quantiles and peak-over-threshold series for the period 1974-2013 at all sites and from the 1950s where data were available. The results were related to trends in seasonal temperature and precipitation from the regional high-elevation meteorological stations and glacier mass balance, equilibrium line altitude (ELA) and accumulation area ratio (AAR) records from the Tuyuksu glacier. The results show no reduction in streamflow in any catchment or season in the northern Tien Shan since the 1950s. Positive trends in all flow indicators, including peakover-threshold frequency, were observed in catchments with higher glacierization of over 10% and extensive presence of rock glaciers and permafrost indicating increased melt over the period which is characterised by a long-term increase in temperature. These trends were most evident in autumn and winter. In catchments with low glacierization, variability in summer flow was controlled primarily by precipitation of the preceding cold season. Correlation with glacier mass balance was weak but changes in ELA and AAR indicate that production of liquid runoff at higher elevations contributes to increased streamflow partly compensating for the declining glacier area. The observed changes in streamflow do not suggest any immediate problems with water availability in the northern Tien Shan. On the contrary, increased autumn and winter flows point at a more prolonged recharge of reservoirs and aquifers though eventually this water source will be exhausted.

AB Conventional neuro-fuzzy systems used for rainfall-runoff (R-R) modelling are generally dependent on expert knowledge. In these models, not only the structure is designed by the expert user, but also all the required knowledge for fuzzy partitioning of the input-output space and rule base need to be provided by the expert. To move towards NFS with a more flexible rule base and structure, efforts are made to integrate the self-reliant mechanisms into the learning algorithm that enable the model to identify the position and distribution of fuzzy labels in input-output space and generate the required rule base. In this study, the self-adaptive fuzzy inference network (SaFIN) is used for the R-R application. SaFIN employs a new clustering technique known as Categorical Learning-Induced Partitioning (CLIP) which allows the model to adapt to the new incoming tuple by consistently updating the model. SaFIN is also equipped with a rule-pruning mechanism that can exclude inconsistent and obsolete rules. In this study, SaFIN R-R models are developed in three different catchment types and sizes where the results are compared against a benchmark NFS model and few physical models including URHM, HBV, GR4J. Results shows that SaFIN is a capable and robust tool for R-R modeling under varying catchment conditions. Moreover, SaFIN produced comparable if not superior results to the benchmark models. It was concluded that SsFIN with its self-reliant learning and rule generation mechanism equipped with rule pruning can make it a competent tool for R-R modelling in catchments where the data may contain some inconsistencies.

AB The future resilience of water supply systems is unprecedentedly challenged by non-stationary processes, such as fast population growth and a changing climate. A thorough understanding of how these non-stationarities impact water supply resilience is vital to support sustainable decision making, particularly for large cities in arid and/or semi-arid regions. In this study, a novel modeling framework, which integrates hydrological processes and water management, was established over a representative water limited metropolitan area to evaluate the impacts of water availability and water demand on reservoir storage and water supply reliability. In this framework, climate change induced drought events were selected from statistically downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 outputs under the Representative Concentration Pathway 83 scenario, while future water demand was estimated by the product of projected future population and per capita water use. Compared with the first half of the 21st century (2000-2049), reservoir storage and water supply reliability during the second half century (2050-2099) are projected to reduce by 16.1% and 14.2%, respectively. While both future multi-year droughts and population growth will lower water supply resilience, the uncertainty associated with future climate projection is larger than that associated with urbanization. To reduce the drought risks, a combination of mitigation strategies (e.g., additional conservation, integrating new water sources, and water use redistribution) was found to be the most efficient approach and can significantly improve water supply reliability by as much as 15.9%.

AB This study quantifies morphological evolution of the Dez River, Iran, from 1955 to 2016. The approach uses a sequence of Landsat images, aerial photos, and topographic maps. In addition, the hydrological data including average daily discharge and yearly maximum discharge at the Dezful hydrological station for the period (1955-2016) were used. The study reach was divided into 48 meander loops from upstream to downstream. Active channel width (w) was determined at 10 m intervals and changes assessed along the study reach of the Dez River. Morphological indices including sinuosity index; straight meander length; centerline flow length; erosion area; erodible length channel migration; centerline elongation; and radius of curvature were calculated in the reach. Results showed that the study reach of the Dez River changed dramatically in response to major floods, although the general trend is towards a narrowing of active channel width by 38% in the period 1955-2016. Results show that most of the meander loops in the study area extended and expanded. Between 1989 and 1995, all types of meander change were observed. There was a direct correlation between the frequency of hydrological events (flood days) bigger than 2-years return period and elongation of bends.

AB Sustainable river basin planning and management is a complex and uncertain phenomenon involving social, economic, environmental and several technical criteria. Despite global advancement, the problems associated sustainability have not been sufficiently addressed, due to mismanaged governance, poorly implemented policies, lack of suitable data and over-exploitation of river resources. Therefore, major rivers basins across the globe need an integrative and comprehensive strategic approach considering the diverse stakeholder's perspective and conflicting criteria pertaining to sustainable management. The present study develops a decision support framework to assess the sustainability by coupling an improved fuzzy based hybridized strength-weakness-opportunities and threats model (FH-SWOT) with a geostatistical approach. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model Ganges river basin, India has been taken as a case study. The novelty of the study is to devise six different hybrid mechanisms under FH-SWOT framework to reach best possible strategic alternatives along with nominal, optimistic and pessimistic perspectives of the stakeholders. To enhance the model's productivity, it is coupled with weighted overlay geo-statistical approach to identify/prioritize the most vulnerable/critical locations, which needs suitable implementation of strategic alternatives derived using FH-SWOT model. The FH-SWOT model developed herein simultaneously delineates strategic alternatives and corresponding priority zones, while addressing the uncertainties related to stakeholder's conflicts and imprecise data to reach optimal, pessimistic and nominal viewpoints, which leads to development of an innovative and comprehensive decision-support framework for assessing sustainability. The key policies derived from the study involve enforcing regulations on disposal of heavy metals, developing hydropower, adaptation of organic farming, education and participation of stakeholders, regulations on dams and barrages with a score of 0.2453, 0.2205, 0.2088, 0.1898, and 0.1288 respectively. Also, Kanpur-Varanasi stretch has been delineated as very high priority zone followed by regions located along the banks of Ganges. Sensitivity analysis proves that the model is robust and can be used by the environment managers towards sustainable planning and management of any river basin, lakes, wetlands or any major water body of the world.

AB Rainfall frequency analysis, which is an important tool in hydrologic engineering, has been traditionally performed using information from gauge observations. This approach has proven to be a useful tool in planning and design for the regions where sufficient observational data are available. However, in many parts of the world where ground-based observations are sparse and limited in length, the effectiveness of statistical methods for such applications is highly limited. The sparse gauge networks over those regions, especially over remote areas and high-elevation regions, cannot represent the spatiotemporal variability of extreme rainfall events and hence preclude developing depth-duration-frequency curves (DDF) for rainfall frequency analysis. In this study, the PERSIANN-CDR dataset is used to propose a mechanism, by which satellite precipitation information could be used for rainfall frequency analysis and development of DDF curves. In the proposed framework, we first adjust the extreme precipitation time series estimated by PERSIANN-CDR using an elevation-based correction function, then use the adjusted dataset to develop DDF curves. As a proof of concept, we have implemented our proposed approach in 20 river basins in the United States with different climatic conditions and elevations. Bias adjustment results indicate that the correction model can significantly reduce the biases in PERSIANN-CDR estimates of annual maximum series, especially for high elevation regions. Comparison of the extracted DDF curves from both the original and adjusted PERSIANN-CDR data with the reported DDF curves from NOAA Atlas 14 shows that the extreme percentiles from the corrected PERSIANN-CDR are consistently closer to the gauge-based estimates at the tested basins. The median relative errors of the frequency estimates at the studied basins were less than 20% in most cases. Our proposed framework has the potential for constructing DDF curves for regions with limited or sparse gauge-based observations using remotely sensed precipitation information, and the spatiotemporal resolution of the adjusted PERSIANN-CDR data provides valuable information for various applications in remote and high elevation areas.

AB Different aspects of management policies for shallow geothermal systems are currently under development. Although this technology has been used for a long time, doubts and concerns have been raised in the last years due to the massive implementation of new systems. To assess possible environmental impacts and manage subsurface energy resources, collecting data from operating shallow geothermal systems is becoming mandatory in Europe. This study presents novel advances in the upscaling of operation datasets obtained from open-loop geothermal energy systems for an optimal integration in hydrogeological models. The proposed procedure allows efficient numerical simulations to be performed at an urban scale. Specifically, this work proposes a novel methodology to optimize the data treatment of highly transient real exploitation regimes by integrating energy transfer in the environment to reduce more than 90% registered raw datasets. The proposed methodology is then applied to and validated on five different real optimization scenarios in which upscaling transformation of the injection temperature series of 15-min sampling frequency has been considered. The error derived from each approach was evaluated and compared for validation purposes. The results obtained from the upscaling procedures have proven the usefulness and transferability of the proposed method for achieving daily time functions to efficiently reproduce the exploitation regimes of these systems with an acceptable error in a sustainable resource management framework.

AB A wide range of real-world flood routing problems can be approached using the Parabolic Approximation, widely recognized as a convenient simplification of the Saint Venant equations. From the Parabolic Approximation, head and discharge-based linear and non-linear advection-diffusion models were also derived by merging mass and momentum conservation equations into a single second-order equation to be used for one-dimensional flood routing. Both head and discharge-based advection-diffusion models were originally derived in their linear forms and extensively studied in the literature because they admit analytical solutions. The discharge-based non-linear models have been used as the basis for the derivation of the variable-parameter Muskingum routing method by setting the truncation error at par with the diffusion parameter. Whereas the linear models are mass-conservative, but inadequately reproduce routing in a variety of cases, the non-linear ones have been recently declared to be non-conservative. In the literature it has also been stated that the variable-parameter Muskingum fails to approximate the discharge-based non-linear discharge based advection-diffusion model on mild slopes. This paper aims at providing a systematic overview of all these models, showing that whereas the non-linear head-based advection-diffusion model, an original version of which is derived here, is in fact conservative, also the discharge-based model, which in principle is not, remains de facto conservative if integrated over a space-time grid with sufficiently small spatial cells. To complete the overview, we also demonstrate that in real-world applications the variable parameter Muskingum gives satisfactory results on mild slopes because lowland rivers in nature are essentially prone to slowly rising hydrographs. The results of all models are intercompared by routing different flood waves through prismatic reference channels with slope 10(-4) and smaller.

AB Flood forecasting is a pre-emptive non-structural measure used to mitigate inundation. Most current flood forecasting techniques incorporate complex processes, such as training and optimization, before the technique can be applied. Conventional flood forecasting techniques, based on flood volume, provide alerts even if there is no significant risk of flood damage. In this study, a new flood forecasting technique has been developed based on likely flood damage using the multi-dimensional flood damage analysis method. This new flood forecasting technique overcomes the drawbacks of current flood forecasting techniques because it can be easily applied using rainfall data. The studied drainage area was divided into subareas, and the damage functions were obtained for each subarea using the flood volumes and damage information. Using these damage functions, the rainfall intensity when the flood damage initially occurred was calculated for each duration and subarea. The damage graph produced for flood forecasting in each subarea identified the rainfall intensities and durations that resulted from the initial occurrence of flood damage. This new flood forecasting technique could be used to save lives, valuable assets, and manage drainage areas.

AB Water-use efficiency (WUE) at the whole-plant level plays as an important role as an indicator of both the water use strategy of the plant, and the ecophysiological processes linking the carbon and water cycles. However, the variation in the annual pattern of WUE, the interannual trends, and the regulating factors of WUE in rubber plantations remain poorly understood. Here, we used a four-year (2013-2016) continuous biometric survey along with sap flow data recorded at a monthly resolution to examine the annual and interannual dynamics of WUE and the relationships of WUE with environmental and biological factors in rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations in Southwest China. The results showed that (1) there was no definitive pattern in WUE between April and December, but the peak WUE values generally occurred around August; (2) the multi-year mean WUE was 2.34 +/- 0.19 g C.kg(-1) H2O, and a negative correlation of WUE to photosynthetically active radiation was found at the interannual scale (r = -0.962, P < 0.05); and (3) a moderate, significant and parabolic relationship of WUE with air temperature (R-2 = 0.40), net radiation (R-2 = 0.37) and growth rate of the diameter at breast height (R-2 = 0.35) was observed at the monthly scale during the growing season (P < 0.001). These findings indicate that WUE might be regulated by factors affecting the carbon sequestration rather than water consumption, and it will provide a deeper understanding of the ecohydrological and coupled processes between the carbon and water cycles of rubber plants.

AB Although mangrove forests are efficient natural carbon sinks, most of the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed by its vegetation is believed to be exported via tidal exchange, rather than stored in the vegetative biomass and sediment. However, the magnitude of tidal export is largely unknown because direct measurements are scarce. We deployed a novel experimental design that combined automated high-resolution measurements of hydrodynamic, hydrogeochemical and biogeochemical parameters during the dry season in a mangrove tidal creek in the Can Gio Mangrove Forest in Vietnam. The objective was to quantify the tide-controlled water, porewater, DIC and DOC exchange, and estimate the CO2 evasion throughout tidal cycles contrasted by amplitude. Data from three 25-h time series showed a dear peak of DIC, DOC, pCO(2), and Rn-222 at low tide, particularly during tidal cycles of large amplitude, which directly relate to porewater discharge. Our mass balance models revealed that the tidal creek was a net exporter of dissolved carbon to coastal waters, with an important contribution (38%) coming from DIC in porewater discharge. Porewater exchange varied from 3.1 +/- 1.6 to 7.1 +/- 2.4 cm day(-1). DIC exchange ranged from 352 +/- 34 to 678 +/- 79 mmoIC m(-2) day(-1); DOC exchange, 20.6 +/- 1.9 to 67.7 +/- 7.9 mmol C m(-2) day(-1); and CO2 evasion, 69.9 +/- 10.5 to 173.7 +/- 26.1 mmoIC m(-2) day(-1). These estimates were in the high range of previous carbon assessments and were explained by (i) the monitoring station being located at equal distance from the head and the mouth of the creek, which minimized carbon degradation and losses associated to transport in water; and (ii) the site being a highly productive mangrove within South East Asia.

AB Many studies suggest that high-density rain gauge networks are required to capture the rainfall heterogeneities necessary to accurately describe the components of the hydrological cycle. However, equipping and maintaining a high-density rain gauge network will also involve high costs. Although many studies provided useful insights on the required accuracy of rainfall estimates to accurately describe the components of the hydrological cycle, most of these studies focused on streamflow simulations, large river basins or urban environments. The objective of this study is therefore to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in areal rainfall, estimated at several spatial resolutions, on hydrological simulations of a small similar to 6.5 km(2) rural lowland catchment. The approach followed in this study is to force a calibrated spatially-distributed hydrological model (SPHY) with rainfall retrieved from an X-band radar and various synthetic rainfall products, calculated using bootstrap samples of a varying number of radar pixels, treated as virtual rain gauge locations within the catchment. This enables us to determine the most appropriate resolution of rainfall data to accurately describe the hydrology of a small rural lowland catchment. We found that the use of one rain gauge to estimate the catchment's areal rainfall may lead to a potential error of more than six times the average hourly rainfall. This may lead to uncertainties in simulated discharge that approach 60% of the average hourly discharge. More than 40 rain gauges are required to reduce the potential error in areal rainfall estimation to values < 0.1 mm h(-1). The associated uncertainty in discharge simulations is 20% if 10 rain gauges are used, and 10% if 40 rain gauges are used. The simulation of soil moisture contents and evapotranspiration rates are hardly affected by the number of rain gauges used to estimate the areal rainfall, which is due to the high saturated hydraulic conductivities of the top-soil. At least 12 gauges per km2 are required to capture the spatial rainfall variation that is present in radar rainfall estimates. Analysis of an individual 18-h rainfall event revealed that the uncertainty in peak areal rainfall estimated using one rain gauge may range between -100% and 600%. The associated uncertainty in simulated discharge for this event ranges between -67 and 233%. With 25 rain gauges the uncertainty in simulated discharge is still in the range of -17 to 33%.

AB A vast amount of future climate scenario datasets, created by climate models such as general circulation models (GCMs), have been used in conjunction with watershed models to project future climate variability impact on hydrological processes and water quality. However, these low spatial-temporal resolution datasets are often difficult to downscale spatially and disaggregate temporarily, and they may not be accurate for local watersheds (Le., state level or smaller watersheds). This study applied the US-EPA (Environmental Protection Agency)'s Climate Assessment Tool (CAT) to create future climate variability scenarios based on historical measured data for local watersheds. As a case demonstration, CAT was employed in conjunction with HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN) model to assess the impacts of the potential future extreme rainfall events and air temperature increases upon nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) and orthophosphate (PO4) loads in the Lower Yazoo River Watershed (LYRW), a local watershed in Mississippi, USA. Results showed that the 10 and 20% increases in rainfall rate, respectively, increased NO3-N load by 9.1 and 18% and PO4 load by 12 and 24% over a 10-year simulation period. In contrast, simultaneous increases in air temperature by 1.0 degrees C and rainfall rate by 10% as well as air temperature by 2.0 degrees C and rainfall rate by 20% increased NO3-N load by 12% and 20%, and PO4 load by 14 and 26%, respectively. A summer extreme rainfall scenario was created if a 10% increase in rainfall rate increased the total volume of rainwater for that summer by 10% or more. When this event occurred, it could increase the monthly loads of NO3-N and PO4, by 31 and 41%, respectively, for that summer. Therefore, the extreme rainfall events had tremendous impacts on the NO3-N and PO4 loads. It is apparent that CAT is a flexible and useful tool to modify historical rainfall and air temperature data to predict climate variability impacts on water quality for local watersheds.

AB Soil freeze-thaw is typically not fully considered in quantifying the hydrology of seasonally frozen catchments located, for instance, on the Third Pole. We investigate the role of soil water content and freeze-thaw state on the runoff dynamics of the headwaters of the Yellow and Yangtze rivers, both situated on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. A version of augmented Noah land surface model (LSM) allowing reliable simulation of key hydro meteorological processes over the Tibetan Plateau is employed and further validated using measured monthly discharge records. From measurements supported by the Noah LSM simulations for more than thirty years (1979-2010), we deduce an annual hysteresis loop, viz. a time lag between measured/simulated runoff and precipitation for both catchments. Our simulation results with the augmented Noah LSM further demonstrate that annual anticlockwise (or clockwise) hysteresis loops are also observed for the liquid soil water (or soil ice). We infer from the LSM simulations that the amount of water stored in the soil is the factor driving the hysteresis between runoff and precipitation, whereby the state of the stored water plays a crucial role in the seasonality of the runoff regime. Further analyses illustrate that inclusion of soil freeze-thaw model physics effectively increases the thermal inertia of the soil column that dampens large variations of soil temperature and turbulent heat fluxes. These findings highlight the importance of soil freeze-thaw for the hydrology and runoff regime across the High Asia's rivers as well as the need for a thorough understanding of this process to generate reliable projections.

AB Surface flows of hydrological interest, including overland flow, runoff, river and channel flow and flooding have received significant attention from modellers in the past 30 years. A growing effort to address these complex environmental problems is in place in the scientific community. Researchers have studied and favoured a plethora of techniques to approach this issue, ranging from very simple empirically-based mathematical models, to physically-based, deductive and very formal numerical integration of systems of partial-differential equations. In this work, we review two families of methods: cell-based simulators later called Cellular Automata - and Finite Volume solvers for the Zero-Inertia equation, which we show to converge into a single methodology given appropriate choices. Furthermore, this convergence, mathematically shown in this work, can also be identified by critically reviewing the existing literature, which leads to the conclusion that two methods originating from different reasoning and fundamental philosophy, fundamentally converge into the same method. Moreover, acknowledging such convergence allows for some generalisation of properties of numerical schemes such as error behaviour and stability, which, importantly, is the same for the converging methodology, a fact with practical implications. Both the review of existing literature and reasoning in this work attempts to aid in the effort of synchronising and cross-fertilizing efforts to improve the understanding and the outlook of Zero-Inertia solvers for surface flows, as well as to help in clarifying the possible confusion and parallel developments that may arise from the use of different terminology originating from historical reasons. Moreover, synchronising and unifying this knowledge-base can help clarify model capabilities, applicability and modelling issues for hydrological modellers, specially for those not deeply familiar with the mathematical and numerical details.

AB A novel form of the lattice Boltzmann method for the Saint-Venant equations (LABSVE) is formulated and implemented. To eliminate equidistant property of the lattice structure being the major drawback of the LBM, and thus establish the LB model as tool for practical application (natural water bodies) fully competitive compared to the presently available computational models, new form of equilibrium distribution function (EDF) based on geometrically transformed Saint-Venant equations (SVE) is derived. Introducing the metric relation function between the physical and computational system, the non-uniform spatial discretization is managed by solving the transformed SVE rather than altering the symmetrical properties of lattice structure. Since the geometrical correlation between the two corresponding systems is introduced into the transformed SVE, the very basic structure of the LBM in terms of simplicity in implementing the boundary conditions and computational efficiency (owing to the parallel structure) is maintained and further improved by removing the limitations imposed by the equidistant lattice condition. Furthermore, the discharge-water level definition of the SVE as more applicable form when natural watercourses are considered, is applied. In this way the bed slope term is completely eliminated from the equations, establishing therefore a model more suitable for natural systems characterized by arbitrary cross sectional geometry. In order to test the proposed non-equidistant LABSVE model, steady flow in prismatic channel, unsteady flow in non-prismatic channel of simple cross section geometry, and unsteady flow along a Danube section is modelled. Additional simulations by using the HEC-RAS modelling tool are conducted in order to produce comparison basis for both unsteady simulations, while in case of the Danube River section actual water level and discharge measurements are additionally used for calibration and verification of the model. Very good agreement between compared results is obtained showing that the proposed non-equidistant form of the LABSVE is capable of solving complex environmental problems, maintaining the order of accuracy, simplicity and efficiency of the basic LBM.

ID RAINWATER; SITES; INDIA; IMPACTS; RUNOFF; MODEL
AB Watershed management in rainfed agricultural areas of arid and semi-arid regions aims at alleviating agricultural drought by employing water conservation measures. Water conservation measures serve as mechanisms for recharging groundwater, and also for surface storage. While the benefits derived from these structures is widely accepted, there is increasing concern regarding their sustainability and efficiency. The application of water conservation measures in upstream reaches contributes to reduced inflows to downstream reaches and structures. Currently watershed management is planned by considering elementary information about the hydrological regime and its associated impacts on the upstream reaches of the watershed. This approach may lead to inefficient water conservation structures, and there is also a significant probability that the structure may be under designed (or over designed). Therefore, careful planning that considers the hydrological changes that the conservation structure may bring in the watershed and the associated benefits/compromise for both upstream and downstream is essential for developing a successful watershed management plan. A simulation-optimization framework for optimal sizing of the water conservation structure considering the dual objectives of improving the benefits in the upstream reaches while maintaining flows in the downstream reaches is proposed in this study. The proposed method is demonstrated for optimal sizing of water conservation structures (check dams in this study) for an experimental watershed in Kondepi Mandal, Andhra Pradesh, India. The results indicate that the check dams of sizes obtained from both traditional method and simulation-optimization method increase moisture availability in the watershed. However, for check dam sizes obtained from the simulation-optimization framework, there is an increase in the flow to downstream reaches compared to the check dam sizes obtained from the traditional methods. The increase in downstream flows obtained by optimizing the check dam heights is at the expense of increased moisture stress days in the non-growing period, thus, not affecting the crop growth or productivity. The results from this study indicate that the proposed simulation-optimization framework can be of assistance in sizing of check dams for sustainable and effective watershed management.

AB Measuremental and methodological problems arising from the presence of ice cover on waterways have seriously hindered the progress in predicting timely and accurate streamflow, which is a prerequisite for the effective management of ice-covered waterways (e.g. streams, rivers, channels, and canals). Among various methods in the attempt to address this issue, the most attractive is the physically-based method, which does not require abundant, and often unobtainable, data. This paper develops a physically based K-factor method, in the form of a generalized Manning equation, for discharge estimations in ice-covered channels. The main advantage of this method is that it enables the prediction of streamflow in ice-affected seasons by a K-factor adjustment of the stage-discharge relationship developed in the open-water seasons. The results of parameter estimation show that the K-factor is only related to the boundary resistance ratio, which is parameterized by two exponents of the two power law for describing the vertical streamwise velocity profile. Experimental measurements collected from the literature were used to test the applicability of the proposed formula, and to compare its relative accuracy with the Sabaneev and Larsen formulae. The comparative results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate in estimating streamflow of ice-covered channels than these two widely-used formulae based on traditional two layer hypothesis.

AB An integrated hydrological model that couples a low-dimensional (2-D) subsurface model to 1-D river flow and 2-D overland flow is presented and applied to a real-world system. The 2-D subsurface equation stems from a careful integration a 3-D Richards equation along a local direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer. A Normally Integrated Model (NIM) is first compared with the integrated model CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) in regard to a synthetic test case with complex geometry, heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field of the subsurface compartment, and various interactions between the surface and the subsurface. This exercise reveals the gain in computation time associated with the use of a low-dimensional model (by a factor of 6). NIM is then applied to simulate the hydrodynamics of an actual restored hydrosystem, namely, Rohrschollen Island of the Upper Rhine River, with the aim of assessing the ability to address highly transient hydrological conditions and the efficiency of the restoration strategy. The calibration and validation steps associated with this exercise show that the coupled model describes the hydraulic head evolution and water mass balance induced by artificial injections of surface water in a channel dug for the purpose of reconnecting the Rhine to an old and clogged channel. The low-dimensional coupled model of this study is simpler than the state-of-the-art integrated models employing the solution of the 3-D Richards equation. It is, however, suited to investigate fine-scale problems in relation to water resource management and hydraulic developments, with reasonable computational costs and a physically-based approach to model flow processes.

AB Reservoir operations are increasingly being asked to consider environmental flow, which is needed to sustain a healthy river ecosystem. The Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) is a tool that is used widely to describe environmental flow regimes, but few studies have explicitly included its parameters in multi-objective reservoir operation models. With the goal of incorporating detailed environmental flow requirements into reservoir operations, this study proposes a two-objective reservoir operation model that includes explicit IHA constraints. A series of formulae is developed to calculate IHA parameters without using a loop or conditional statement, which allows operators to manage environmental flow directly. An experimental operation of the Jinghong reservoir in the upstream portion of the Mekong Basin is conducted to apply the method. The economic objective is defined by hydropower production (HP), while the environmental flow objective is represented by a weighted aggregate eco-index (ED based on IHA parameters. Five scenarios with different objective functions and constraints are compared, and the results show that the scenario with "HP-EI" as its objective achieved optimal benefits for both indices. Hard EI and explicit IHA constraints led to significant loss of HP that can be attributed to variations of inflow. To make this model more convenient for practical use, operation rule curves are regressed from the optimized results of the model. Finally, policy implications of the operation with economic and environmental objectives and some limitations are discussed. The quantification method of IHA parameters provides significant reference value for reservoir environmental operation issues.

TI Low-flow frequency analysis at ungauged sites based on regionally

AB Estimation of low-flow quantiles or indices at ungauged sites is traditionally done through regional low-flow frequency analysis. However, traditional methods imply a prior aggregation of the regional information due to the usual focus on a given quantile. This leads to loss of information for estimating additional quantiles or performing additional applications. In the present study, the recently proposed regional streamflow based frequency analysis (RSBFA) approach is evaluated for the estimation of low-flow quantiles. The approach, originally applied to floods, is based on regionally estimating the daily streamflow series at the ungauged site to later obtain hydrological quantiles through a local frequency analysis. In the present study, the RSBFA approach is applied to low flows through a case study in the province of Quebec, Canada, considered in prior traditional regional low-flow studies. Although the RSBFA approach does not systematically lead to the best results, its relevance resides in the fact that the whole regionally estimated daily streamflow series is provided at the ungauged site. This allows an easy estimation of low-flow quantiles associated to particular durations, such as the 7-day (30-day) average low flows corresponding to a return period of 2 or 10 years (5 years). Furthermore, a large range of additional low-flow quantiles, such as q(95%) (streamflow expected to be exceeded 95% of the time divided by the catchment area), may be obtained from the regionally estimated streamflow series with a very good performance. Therefore, any specific or absolute, annual or seasonal low-flow quantile may be easily obtained by a local low-flow frequency analysis without repeating the regional procedure. The approach does not require complex models, and it may also allow combining regional and local information in a straight forward manner.

AB Numeric criteria are crucial for controlling cultural eutrophication and for protecting current and future water quality. Anthropogenic climate change and the modification of land use have the potential to influence the development of nutrient criteria. In this study, stressor-response models, land use-nutrient regression models, and terrestrial ecosystem health states were used to determine the criterion values of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), and chlorophyll a (Chl a) using field data from lakes and reservoirs in Heilongjiang Province. Analysis of covariance and nonlinear regressions were used to quantitatively characterize the impact of climate change on the development of nutrient criteria. The results indicated that there were no significant differences in the nutrient criteria obtained by the various methods. Climate change factors (such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed) are predicted to influence the relationships between nutrients and Chl a, as well as land use and nutrient concentrations, as climate change persists. Climate change should be considered during the development of nutrient criteria, as climate-driven change and achieving a desired water quality without the threat of eutrophication in the future will require stricter nutrient criteria than those needed under the current climate conditions.

AB Random walk path methods including walk on spheres and walk on rectangles have been used to solve elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). These methods are able to provide not only the pointwise solutions to the linear PDEs but also contributions of boundaries and all source/sink terms as an analytical solution does. However, due to difficulty in dealing with heterogeneity, these methods cannot be applied to groundwater flow problems in highly heterogeneous aquifers. A novel method called walk on grid (WOG) is proposed based on lattice random walk to overcome the difficulty. WOG algorithm is verified in a 1D homogeneous transient problem, a 1D heterogeneous steady-state problem, a 2D heterogeneous transient problem and a 3D optimization problem. It is demonstrated that WOG is effective in solving groundwater flow problems in highly heterogeneous confined aquifers. Probabilities of walkers arriving at prescribed boundaries (terminal weights) and source counts may be useful for characterization of medium heterogeneity. WOG method sheds a new light on solving the PDEs of complicated groundwater problems in a changing environment and on analyzing medium heterogeneity.

AB Accurate evaluation of the relative contribution of climatic and vegetative drivers on land evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for interpreting the ET controlling mechanism, modeling and predicting. However, how to accurately separate and estimate the contribution of climatic and vegetative changes on ET variation remains uncertain. Our study attempted to interpret the interannual variation in ET during 2007-2013 over a maize field in northwest China, using four methods simultaneously, such as the Penman-Monteith (PM) model, the modified crop coefficient method, the Priestly-Taylor (PT) model and the regression linear model.
   Results indicate that compared to the ET in 2007, the ET decreased averagely by 12, 30, 29, and 73 W m(-2) in 2008, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. All models yielded similar results and showed that the vegetative controls played a more important role in regulating ET relative to climatic drives, and that more than half of decrease in ET was caused by vegetative factors, while the differences in net radiation, water vapor pressure deficit and air temperature among years were lesser source of variation in ET. Furthermore, the advantage and disadvantage of the four methods were discussed.
   Our study confirmed the great effect of vegetative drivers in regulating crop ET, highlighted the importance of estimating canopy conductance accurately in ET modeling and prediction, and provided new approaches for separating the climatic and vegetative contribution on ET changes.

AB Solute and/or heat penetration into a fracture-matrix system is an important subject in subsurface transport. Solute and/or heat partitions among the fracture and its surrounding rock matrixes are based on coupled transport processes that are closely related to transport properties of the media. The penetration processes in an asymmetric fracture-matrix system are more complicated than that in a symmetric fracture-matrix system, due to different matrix properties. Accurate quantification of plume distribution in such a system is the basis of re mediation design and risk assessment of a contaminated fracture-matrix system. Closed-form analytical and semi-analytical solutions (involving integrations) are obtained in this study to quantify the influences of asymmetric matrix properties on solute penetration processes in a fracture-matrix system. Advection, matrix diffusion, sorption, source decay and aqueous phase decay are considered. Numerical simulations are performed using HydroGeoSphere to test the solutions. Well matched curves of the numerical results and the closed-form solutions and semi-analytical solutions are obtained. The matrix porosity and retardation factor appear to significantly affect the spatiotemporal distribution of solute in a fracture-matrix system. Penetration depth in the matrix is a linear attenuation function of the horizontal distance from the source. And a new dimensionless number called the Z number (or the matrix penetration number) is defined to quantify the maximal penetration depth into the matrix. The solutions obtained can act as an effective tool for assessment of solute and/or heat transport in a fracture-matrix system. The solutions are also applicable to advection-dominated solute and/or heat transport in a thin aquifer bounded by two different aquitards.

AB We present artificial neural network (ANN) based software for rapidly predicting the recovery effectiveness (REN) of aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) wells in fresh water aquifers. The REN performance criterion equals the amount of the water injected in an ASR well that is recoverable via the same well during a specified extraction period. The software circumvents the need to prepare and run computationally intensive simulations, by invoking ANN models as surrogate simulators. The paper presents the development of the ANN models and a graphical user interface (GUI) to facilitate using the ANN models and to perform sensitivity analysis. ANN inputs include all factors significantly affecting REN in freshwater aquifers. The software can evaluate REN in any ASR system in confined aquifers whose parameters are within the range of parameters used for training the ANNs in this study.

AB Flow-sediment relationships provide insights into the erosion and transport of materials within catchments. Investigating the flow-sediment relationships across multiple timescales can reveal trends related to the effects of natural and human-caused changes to catchments. This study chose fourteen main catchments in the Loess Plateau of China, which are the major sediment sources of Yellow River, to extract the temporal patterns of flow-sediment relationships during the 1950s-2014 period. The study revealed quantifiable effects of land use/cover changes (LUCC) on the variability of flow-sediment relationships. The LUCC induced by the soil and water conservation measures (SWCMs) during 1970-1999 and vegetation restoration campaign since 2000 resulted in significant reductions of annual streamflow, sediment yield and sediment concentration. The mean daily sediment concentration under different flow conditions also decreased greatly. The flow-sediment relationships revealed time dependence over different stages and time scales. Before 2000, the annual and monthly flow-sediment relationships could be generally characterized by the linear functions, and the power-law sediment rating curve was able to describe the daily flow-sediment relationship. As vegetation restoration campaign took effect, the flow-sediment relationship became much weaker, which could not be described by a clear relationship. This suggests that the variability of flow-sediment relationships over the entire period was mainly regulated by the vegetation restoration campaign. In addition, the sediment concentration exhibited a linear decreasing relationship with the area under land use/cover treatment. In this way, the study has brought out the roles of ecological restoration measures in controlling the temporal variability of flow-sediment relationships at the catchment scale.

AB The areas of glacial lakes in the Himalayas continue to increase alarmingly due to global warming with consequent risk of glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). The outburst is most common for moraine-dammed lakes as a result of a failure of the dam by overtopping and erosion or piping due to seepage. In the present context, GLOF events, especially for the moraine dam failure process needs to be predicted to assess the drastic and detrimental impacts on the downstream river valley. This study focuses on validating an integrated model for simulating the failure of moraine dam by overtopping and erosion using a coupled numerical simulation model. The proposed numerical methodology is validated with the data from experiments in laboratory scale physical models. The results of the model are compared for both the erosional profiles during collapse of the dam and the resulting outflowing flood hydrograph. The primary finding is that the moraine dam height and the volume of the lake upstream of the dam are the most sensitive parameters influencing the GLOF peak. The model is also applied to the field problem of the Tangjiashan lake outburst and dam failure and shows reasonably good agreement with observations. The validated model is also run for the South Lhonak glacial lake in the Sikkim Himalayas, India to obtain the probable flood hydrograph in case of failure of the moraine dam.

AB Although numerous studies have investigated the relationships between hydrological drought (HD) and meteorological drought (MD) in different regions, few studies have examined the influence of reservoir operations during drought periods on such relationships, particularly at multiple time scales. This study presents a useful framework to examine the influences of reservoir operation rules during drought periods on the multi-scale correlations between HD and MD. Two standardized drought indices (Standardized Streamfiow Index (SSI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)) with different timescales (1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months) were used to compare the pre-reservoir and post-reservoir periods. Also, a simple algorithm was proposed to examine the difference value (D-value) between the inflow and outflow under different reservoir operation rules and it was used to evaluate the impacts of the reservoir operation rules during the drought on the correlation of the HD and MD. Monthly streamflow and precipitation records from 1960 to 2015 and monthly inflow and outflow records of a large reservoir (Xinfengjiang reservoir) during 1974-2009 in the basin of the Dongjiang River in south China were used to demonstrate the applicability of the analysis methodology. The results indicate that (1) the reservoir operations during the post-reservoir period (1974-2015) exerted a significant influence (positive impact) on the evolution of the short-term (1 and 3 months) HD by reducing the drought duration and alleviating its magnitude and altered the linear correlation between the HD and MD compared to the pre-reservoir period (1960-1972). However, the effects on the long-term (e.g., 12 and 24 months) HD and its correlation with the MD were not apparent. (2) The impacts of the reservoir operation under the drought condition on the relationship between the HD and MD were clearly different from those under normal rules. This study provides additional information for policy-makers to regarding reservoir management during a drought.

AB A warming climate is expected to perturb the hydrological cycle, resulting in changes to both the frequency and duration of drought, especially in arid and semiarid grassland. Although considerable attention has been paid to the responses of key water fluxes to severe drought, few have explored the effects of prolonged drought on evapotranspiration (ET), its partitioning into vegetation transpiration (T) and soil evaporation (E), and its relationship with vegetation productivity. In this study, we used a combination of the eddy covariance (EC) flux technique and satellite remote sensing products to evaluate the effects of prolonged drought on ET components based on the concept of underlying water use efficiency (uWUE). The results showed T accounted for about 51% (standard deviation +/- 0.03%) of ET during prolonged drought lower than those in normal and/or wet years (range, 59-62%). We detected strong positive relationships between the T/ET ratios and aboveground biomass (AGB), leaf area index (LAI), and precipitation (R-2 of 0.80, 0.58, and 0.49, respectively). The specific responses of ecosystem functioning to prolonged drought indicated that grassland ecosystem was able to resist the drought disturbance and retain vegetation growth to a certain extent unless extreme drought hit. The results implied that more intense and prolonged droughts will result in ecological degradation and substantial changes in ecosystem functioning. And these results improve our understanding of how the climate change will affect the function and structure of grassland ecosystem.

AB In this work, we propose a mathematical model within a dynamic optimization framework to address the management of a salt lake in a semiarid region in Argentina (Chasico Lake). The main objective is to elaborate strategies to control recurrent floods and keep salinity values around the physiological optimum for the high-commercial value fish silverside. The model comprises dynamic mass balances for water and salt, as well as evaporation calculation based on energy and momentum balances on a daily basis. A collection of meteorological and hydraulic data in the basin for several decades and bathymetric information is included. The simulation of different scenarios with historical data provide a deeper insight into the ecohydrological dynamics of Chasico, Lake basin. Model predictions under moderate drought conditions, with rainfall about 70% of the historic average, show a large increase in salinity after three years under that setting. This would induce drastic changes in ecological conditions producing fish mass mortality, what likely occurred repeatedly throughout the lake's history, since such dry periods occurred repeatedly during the analyzed 1911-2016 period. The comparison between drought and wet scenarios indicates a differential vulnerability dynamics in which the system shows less resistance to the effects of drought than to those due to floods. The proposed model allows the determination of optimal lake tributary diversion flowrate to prevent flooding of croplands, keeping lake salinity within optimal values for silverside, and providing water for the creation of wetlands for wildlife and an artificial reservoir for alleviation of wet period effects.

AB Regionalization and pooling stations to form homogeneous regions or communities are essential for reliable parameter transfer, prediction in ungauged basins, and estimation of missing information. Over the years, several clustering methods have been proposed for regional analysis. Most of these methods are able to quantify the study region in terms of homogeneity but fail to provide microscopic information about the interaction between communities, as well as about each station within the communities. We propose a complex network-based approach to extract this valuable information and demonstrate the potential of our approach using a rainfall network constructed from the Indian gridded daily precipitation data. The communities were identified using the network-theoretical community detection algorithm for maximizing the modularity. Further, the grid points (nodes) were classified into universal roles according to their pattern of within- and between-community connections. The method thus yields zoomed-in details of individual rainfall grids within each community.

AB Quantifying the role of embedded-rock fragments in soil-water processes on a slope is crucial for the application of rock fragments in soil and water conservation practice. In this study, a laboratory runoff and erosion experiment was conducted in the soils embedded with rock fragments (including five rock fragment contents (RC) of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 kg kg(-1)) in a metal flume under three slopes (5 degrees, 10 degrees, and 15 degrees). Results showed that the mean steady infiltration rate in the soil without rock fragment (NULL) was lower than that in the soils containing rock fragments (low rock fragment contents of 0.1-0.2 kg kg(-1) and high rock fragment contents of 0.3-0.4 kg kg(-1), labelled as LOW and HIGH, respectively) as slope gradient = 5 degrees, but was higher than the latter two soils as slope gradients = 10 degrees and 15 degrees. Initial infiltration rate significantly increased with RC (P < 0.05). Runoff discharge was negatively related to RC as slope gradient = 5 degrees and was positively related to it as slope gradients = 10 degrees and 15 degrees. There was a steady sediment concentration (SC) after runoff generated as slope gradient = 5 degrees. Sediment discharge and soil erosion modulus for the treatment of HIGH significantly increased with slope gradient (P < 0.05). Reynolds number (Re) decreased with RC and the other hydraulic parameters of friction coefficient (f), shear stress (tau), and stream power (omega) increase with RC. In general, the embedded-rock fragment in the soil can accelerate soil erosion by changing the ratio of infiltration/runoff, surface roughness, and related hydraulic parameters, especially under higher slope gradients. Our findings suggest that using rock fragments to control soil erosion is workable only under the conditions of lower slope gradients and rock fragment contents.

AB Continental flow plays a significant role in the global ecosystem. With increased global warming and a booming economy exacerbating water scarcity, global analyses of continental discharge are of great relevance to water management. In this paper, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, with variations accounting for lag-1 autocorrelation, full autocorrelation, and long-term persistence, was used to detect the long-term flow trends in 916 of the world's largest ocean-reaching rivers over the period 1948-2004. Field significance was evaluated using Walker's test. Globally, the results revealed more decreases in streamflow than increases. With the traditional MK test, 503 rivers had decreased streamflow, with 120 showing significant decreases, whereas 408 rivers had increased streamflow, with 51 showing significant increases. Regionally, positive streamflow trends mainly occurred in high-latitude areas and negative streamflow trends mainly occurred in low-latitude areas, a pattern that can be attributed to uneven precipitation and the effects of global warming. When the full autocorrelation structure and long-term persistence behavior were taken into account in the trend analysis, there was a large reduction in the number of rivers with significant changes in streamflow. Negligible departures from the traditional MK results were observed when only the lag-1 autocorrelation was taken into consideration. For the Americas and Europe, annual integrated river flow showed a slight upward trend; for other continents, there was a slight downward trend. For all oceans except the Arctic Ocean, integrated river flow had a downward trend. We investigated the causal relationships between streamflow and ocean signals using the Granger causality test. El Nifio Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signals were significantly causal for river flow in over 36% of global rivers tested. The influence of the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was significant in more than a quarter of rivers studied. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was responsible for the variation in streamflow for over a quarter of rivers studied. Streamflow was affected by the interactions between ocean signals as well as by anthropogenic activities.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the impacts of static and dynamic land use input conditions on the performance of non-point source (NPS) model and find out whether dynamic land use input can improve the model accuracy. Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was selected as the evaluation model and seven different land use input conditions were set by setting the land use update file in SWAT. The results showed that the land use pattern in the study area changed from 2000 to 2015 due to climate change and human activities, leading to inconsistencies between different land use patterns. The calibrated results indicated that dynamic land use input conditions could apparently improve the simulation accuracy of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). CE5Y condition had the best calibrated result with R-2 and NSE larger than 0.7 and 0.6, respectively. However, for flow simulation, the land use input conditions had no apparent effect on the model calibration and validation results. The deviation analysis of the model outputs indicated that monthly outputs were more affected by the land use input conditions than annual outputs and that deviations in wet seasons were larger than those in normal and dry seasons. The highest MAD occurred in June and August with a value of 82.87 t and 1.56 t for TN and TP, respectively. This study revealed the importance to consider the land use change when simulating the NPS pollution, and could provide support for land use input settings of NPS pollution models.

AB This paper presents a case study on an ancient drainage system in the Hetao old urban center, Ganzhou, China, which is playing a key role in the prevention of urban flooding. The system includes ancient city walls, a Fushou ditch, and ponds. The ancient city walls were constructed to defend the river water intrusion. The Fushou ditch and ponds primarily served for the drainage and storage of the rainwater, respectively. The process of rainwater management in the Ganzhou ancient drainage system, including the guidance, storage, infiltration, purification and utilization, and drainage of rainwater, confirms the feasibility of the design concept of modern sponge city. Based on the lessons learnt from this ancient drainage system, the guideline for the rainwater management and design of sponge city is proposed. It is suggested that the sponge city should be planned before the new urban development. During the construction of sponge city, the dispersed ponds and the ditches made of durable and permeable materials in Ganzhou ancient drainage system are recommended to increase the amount of infiltration, storage and utilization of rainwater.

AB The Heihe River basin is one of the important bases for commercial grain production in China. The climate change impacts on crop yield and crop water productivity (CWP) need to be examined for sustainable development of regional agriculture, especially under the pressure of population growth and regional water scarcity. A distributed hydrological model was constructed for the upper-middle reaches of the Heihe River basin on the basis of the Soil and Water Assessment Model (SWAT). The sensitivity ranks of hydrological parameters were evaluated for the runoff and evapotranspiration processes, and then independently calibrated with the observations of three gauging stations (Qilian, Zhamashike, and Yingluoxia stations) and the evapotranspiration data derived by remote-sensing. The study first simulated crop yield and CWP for four typical crop types, namely corn, spring wheat, spring barley, and spring canola-Polish, for the period of 1966-2014 using the SWAT model, calibrated with the crop yield data (during the period of 2005-2014) from Zhangye Statistics Yearbook. The spatial-temporal features of crop yield and CWP were analyzed. A fluctuating growth was found for the 49 year trend of corn, spring wheat, and spring canola-Polish. The spring barley shows a slightly decreasing trend. The high-yield area moved from the west part (Suzhou and Gaotai counties) to the east part (Linze, Ganzhou, and Shandan counties) of the basin for the past 49 years, and the area of high CWP concentrated in the Gaotai and Linze Counties. The responses of CWP to climatic forcing were further studied using wavelet coherence method. It is found that maximum temperature dominated the CWP evolutions, especially at the long-term scales. The corn showed the largest elastic responses to the climatic factors, which may be favorable to improve regional CWP by expanding planting area. In addition, the strategies of regional CWP improvement were discussed based on the results.

AB Simulation of variably saturated soil water flow requires the use of pressure head, or soil moisture, or a switching between the two, as the primary variable for solving Richards' equation. Under unfavorable conditions, such as heterogeneity, rapidly changing atmospheric boundary, or sudden infiltration into dry soils, the traditional non switching method suffers from numerical difficulties. Solving this problem with a primary variable switching method is less preferred due to the mathematical complexity. While the Picard method is more popular for solving the non-switching models due to its simplicity and stability, two different forms of Richards' equation are combined into one numerical scheme for switching under specific hydraulic conditions. The method is successfully implemented in a one-dimensional model solved by a Picard iteration scheme. A threshold saturation based on the soil moisture retention relation is used for switching between either form of the Richards' equation. The method developed here is applicable for simulating variably saturated subsurface flow in heterogeneous soils. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed model conserves mass well and is numerically more stable and efficient.

AB Satellite-based rainfall products (SRPs) are nowadays available at ever increasing accuracy and higher spatial and temporal resolution with respect to the past. Despite this, they are scarcely used in hydrological modeling. The main reasons may be related to: 1) the large bias characterizing satellite precipitation estimates, which is dependent on rainfall intensity and the season, 2) the relatively large spatial/temporal resolution with respect to the applications, 3) the timeliness, which is often insufficient for operational purposes, and 4) a general (often not justified) skepticism of the hydrological community in the use of satellite products for land applications.
   The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using SRPs to force a lumped hydrologic model - MISDc - over 15 basins in the Mediterranean area with different sizes and physiographic characteristics. Specifically, TMPA 3B42-RT, CMORPH, PERSIANN and a new soil moisture-derived rainfall datasets, SM2RAIN(CCI), obtained through the application of SM2RAIN algorithm (Brocca et al., 2014) to ESA CCI soil moisture product are used in the analysis. The performances obtained with the selected SRPs are compared with those obtained from a ground-based rainfall product (E-OBS). In addition, the performance obtained by an integration of the SRPs is investigated to see whether merged rainfall observations are able to improve flood simulations.
   The results highlight that SRPs provide relatively low performances when used to force MISDc model with respect to the case where ground observations are used. Worst results are obtained in smaller basins (< 500 km(2)) that, however, represent the main target for flood modelling in the Mediterranean area. Relatively better performances are obtained when independent SRPs are integrated each other, and particularly for the case where TMPA 3842-RT is integrated with SM2RAIN(CCI). In accordance with previous studies, this suggests that the exploitation (via integration) of independent sources of rainfall offers a potential way to reduce rainfall-induced streamflow errors, even in challenging areas like the Mediterranean.

AB The low-resolution characteristic of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) products greatly limits their application in many fields at regional or local scale. Aiming to overcome this limitation, a random forest (RF)-based downscaling approach was proposed in this study to disaggregate the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) SSM product with the synergistic use of the Optical/Thermal infrared (TIR) observations from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. The Iberian Peninsula was selected as the study area during the period from 2015 to 2016.
   First, the performance of the RF-based approach in building the SSM relationship model with surface variables (surface temperature, vegetation index, leaf area index, albedo, water index, solar factor, and elevation) was compared with that resulting from a widely used polynomial-based relationship model. Good agreement was achieved for the RF-based method with a correlation coefficient (R) above 0.95 and a mean root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.009 m(3)/m(3).
   Next, four data combinations (AM + Terra, AM + Aqua, PM + Terra, and PM + Aqua) were generated according to the different overpass times of the SMAP and MODIS observations, and they were separately used to derive the spatially downscaled SSM with the proposed RF-based downscaling method. Validation was performed with the in situ measurements from the REMEDHUS network of the University of Salamanca in Spain. The results indicated that all combinations have similar good performances with an unbiased root-mean-square difference (ubRMSD) of 0.022 m(3)/m(3), and the downscaled SSM at 1-km spatial resolution presented better accuracy while showing higher spatial heterogeneity and more detailed temporal pattern.
   Finally, the temporal changing pattern of the downscaled SSM was assessed with the precipitation time series from eight meteorological stations in the study area, and the rainfall effect on the variation of SSM was well tracked from its temporal changes.
   Overall, this study suggests that the proposed RF-based downscaling method is able to capture the variation of SSM well, and it should be helpful to improve the resolution of passive microwave soil moisture data and facilitate their applications at small scales.

AB Large tipping-bucket flow meters (TBFs, one tip > 200 ml) have been employed by hydrologists to quantify various water fluxes in a variety of contexts. The over-arching goal of this study is to develop a generalized correction equation for various TBFs. Based on our testing, we recommend the following to minimize TBF error: (1) periodic checking of the static calibration volume (c) since c is a gauge-specific value which has been found to vary after field deployment; and (2) for dynamic calibration, the use of our newly derived generalized correction equation when the tipping rate is less than 0.2 Hz. In equation form, the generalized correction equation for common TBFs with flat triangular buckets is: V = -0.75Q(2) + 0.72Q + 1 (R-2 = 0.843; p < 0.0001), where V = v/c and v is the water volume for one tip under dynamic conditions, and Q = q/c [s(-1)] and q is the water flow rate into the TBF. From our field test in a Japanese cedar forest stand, using stemflow (S-F) as an example, we found that use of the generalized correction equation was successful in eliminating the 2-3% error in S-F amounts. Moreover, we found that the generalized correction equation performed nearly as well as gauge specific derived correction equations. Thus, our generalized correction equation is applicable to correct flow estimates of TBFs when one does not have time and/or laboratory set-up for the laborious task of testing individual TBFs themselves. Although our correction procedure may not completely eliminate all error, we recommend use of the generalized correction equation for TBFs to improve the accuracy of water flux calculations in hydrologic studies.

TI Identification of the optimum groundwater quality monitoring network
   using a genetic algorithm based optimization approach
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article

ID CONTAMINANT PLUME; DESIGN; MANAGEMENT; MODELS
AB Management of groundwater requires a sufficient coverage of accurate groundwater quality data. These data are usually collected from monitoring wells which are spatially distributed in the river basin or the groundwater body that is studied. A minimum number of monitoring wells with an optimum spatial distribution is desired to ensure a cost-effective observation of the groundwater body. Therefore, the configuration of groundwater monitoring networks and the number of required wells becomes an important engineering optimization problem. The goal of this study is to find an optimum monitoring network with the fewest wells that provides sufficient spatial coverage on groundwater quality. With the presented method redundant wells in an already existing network are identified. Here, a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization approach is used in which each monitoring well in the watershed is represented with a binary GA bit to evaluate if the corresponding monitoring well will be selected for the network. The proposed approach can solve the problem by simultaneously optimizing two conflicting objectives. The first objective is the maximization of the match between the interpolated groundwater quality concentration distributions obtained using data from all available monitoring wells and the wells from the newly generated network. The match is primarily evaluated using the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS) model efficiency. Groundwater quality is represented by the water quality index (WQI) that aggregates several quality parameters. The second objective deals with the minimization of the number of monitoring wells in the newly generated network by considering cost-related constraints. These two objectives are integrated in a single objective function where different combinations of both objectives are investigated by considering two cases. The applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated for the groundwater monitoring network of the Gediz River Basin (GRB) which is one of the most important river basins in Turkey. Findings indicate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of monitoring wells with a relatively small deviation of the spatial distribution of the WQI values. Also, the monitoring network is optimized such that sampling points are removed from less polluted areas and selected in areas with higher pollutant concentrations.

AB Increasing meteorological data availability and quality implies an adaptation of the interpolation methods for data combination. In this paper, we propose a new method to efficiently combine weather radar data with data from two heated rain gauge networks of different quality. The two networks being non-collocated (no common location between the two networks), pseudo cross-variograms are used to compute the linear model of coregionalization for kriging computation. This allows considering the two networks independently in a co-kriging approach. The methodology is applied to the Upper Rhone River basin, an Alpine catchment in Switzerland with a complex topography and an area of about 5300 km(2). The analysis explores the newly proposed Regression co-kriging approach, in which two independent rain gauge networks are considered as primary and secondary kriging variables. Regression co-kriging is compared to four other methods, including the commonly applied Inverse distance weighting method used as baseline scenario. Incorporation of additional networks located within and around the target region in the interpolation computation is also explored. The results firstly demonstrate the added value of the radar information as compared to using only ground stations. As compared to Regression kriging using only the network of highest quality, the Regression co-kriging method using both networks slightly increases the performance. A key outcome of the study is that Regression co-kriging performs better than Inverse distance weighting even for the data availability scenario when the radar network was providing lower quality radar data over the studied basin. The results and discussion underline that combining meteorological information from different rain gauge networks with different equipments remains challenging for operational purposes. Future research in this field should in particular focus on additional pre-processing of the radar data to account for example for areas of low visibility of the weather radars due to the topography.

AB Groundwater, as the world's most important reserve of available fresh water, is known to be affected by urbanization. Managing this resource in a sustainable way is critical for water resource management. Groundwater recharge rates in urban areas remain however still poorly understood and under researched and knowledge about these rates and their expected changes under increasing urbanization is therefore of primary importance. This study aims to give insight into urban groundwater recharge by performing water budget calculations for four different time periods for an urban study site in northern Switzerland. In order to take into account uncertainty in parameter values a Monte Carlo (MC) approach was carried out.
   Our study highlights a strong positive correlation between groundwater recharge rates and the extent of the urban area. In detail, at the study site urban areas expanded from 6% in 1880 to 44% in 2009, leading to an increase in the mean groundwater recharge rate. However, the increase amount in recharge remains uncertain and varies between 29% and 67% depending on the parameter combination originating from the MC approach. Based on our water budget calculations, the transformation of natural landscapes into impervious areas leads to an increase in groundwater recharge rates due to the reduction of evapotranspiration that more than compensates for the increase in runoff. Furthermore, water main leakages contribute to an increase in recharge rates. Overall, we demonstrate that a better understanding of groundwater recharge changes in urban areas is required to move towards a sustainable water management. We hope that this example will encourage the hydrogeological community to pay more attention to urban groundwater recharge. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Application of stable isotope methods to evaluate the contribution of different water sources to groundwater recharge relies on the knowledge about isotopic signatures of these sources. The data collected at study sites in the Canadian Prairies show that snowpack isotopic signatures exhibit a high spatial variability over a small scale (<100 m) limiting the usefulness of point samples to estimate an average isotopic composition of snow over a large area. Isotopic signatures of snowmelt runoff can be different from those of pre-melt snowpack, further undermining the applicability of snow isotopic signature to characterisation of snowmelt-driven hydrological processes. Accounting for the actual signature of snow melt runoff has strong effects on its perceived role in recharging groundwater. The data also show that diffuse and depression-focussed components of groundwater recharge have different isotopic signatures, where the latter closely resembles snowmelt runoff.

AB Despite the efficient removal of many contaminants including pathogens and trace organic chemicals (TOrCs) during managed aquifer recharge (MAR), fate and transport of TOrCs in the subsurface might not always occur under conditions that favor effective biotransformation resulting in a contamination risk where water is recovered for drinking water production. A promising technology that can lead to improved removal of TOrCs is the sequential MAR technology (SMART), which combines two infiltration steps with an intermediate aeration to establish more favorable oxic and carbon-limited conditions resulting in enhanced TOrCs transformation. The aim of this study was to test the performance of the SMART concept under field conditions in comparison to a conventional MAR using pond infiltration (cMAR) operated in Berlin, Germany. Although oxic conditions were obtained at both field sites considering infiltration depth to 200 cm, redox conditions were more stable at the SMART facility fed with bank filtrate. In addition, carbon-limited conditions were solely observed during SMART. Chemicals known to persist during MAR, including candesartan, carbamazepine, dihydroxydihydrocarbamazepine, olmesartan, oxypurinol, phenylethylmalonamide, primidone, and tolyltriazole exhibited a refractory behavior at both field sites, whereas valsartan acid, metformin, and gabapentin-lactam were removed by more than 85% during 200 cm of infiltration. 4-Formylaminoantipyrine, acesulfame, benzotriazole, and gabapentin exhibited a significantly enhanced transformation during SMART compared to the cMAR site. These results confirm that SMART can result in controlled oxic and carbon-depleted subsurface conditions during MAR facilitating an improved transformation of moderately degradable TOrCs by natural treatment processes.

AB Climate change can directly influence groundwater systems through modification of recharge. Affecting not only groundwater levels and flow dynamics, climate change can also modify the fragmentation and hierarchy of groundwater flow systems. In this study, the influence of climate change - impacted recharge on groundwater levels and on inter-connected groundwater flow patterns is evaluated. Special emphasis is placed on how flow system hierarchy may change, to examine possible consequences on groundwater-related shallow surface water bodies and on groundwater - surface water interaction. As a test site with no significant anthropogenic impacts, the Tihany Peninsula in Hungary was an ideal area for the study. We address the following issues: i) How might a groundwater system, including groundwater-surface water interaction, be modified by predicted climate change?, ii) Given the variable groundwater levels and flow patterns, how will the water levels and fluxes be impacted around surface water bodies?, and iii) How sensitive are groundwater-related wetlands to these changes, and will they be maintained or will they eventually disappear? In order to answer these questions, two-dimensional transient numerical simulations were performed based on site-specific measurements and climatic prediction at the Tihany Peninsula. Results show that future climate trends can cause dynamic evolution and dissipation of transient groundwater flow systems, and the characteristic flow system hierarchy can change from nested flow systems to a set of single flow cells. Preservation of associated groundwater dependent ecosystems would be challenging under these conditions since long-term climate change could potentially have serious consequences, including wetland disappearance. Understanding these transient processes in two-dimensions can also help to set-up three-dimensional site-specific models. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID RIVER-BASINS; FRAMEWORK; CONFLICT
AB Water is central to sustainable development; making transboundary cooperation among riparian a core aspect of Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 6 on water and sanitation includes an indicator, SDG Indicator 6.5.2, to assess cooperation over transboundary waters by measuring the "Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation." The definitions developed by the methodology for calculating the Indicator have the potential to significantly impact the resulting structure and type of cooperation that are assessed and that will develop. Indeed, the composition of this indicator will both directly and indirectly influence water diplomacy, international policy, and water law. In this research, we analyze the methodology for assessing SDG Indicator 6.5.2, examine how operational cooperative arrangements are defined, and identify the strengths and limitations of the method for measuring transboundary water cooperation. This is done by simulating the application of the methodology and calculating the Indicator in three national case studies (Bangladesh, Honduras, and Uganda) and in a global overview. The unequal distribution regionally of operational cooperation is evident, as well as the gap in coverage between transboundary surface waters and aquifers. However, the normative and binary nature of the Indicator obscures the political complexity of establishing cooperative processes and has the potential to present a false depiction of the extent of cooperation that is occurring over shared waters. In this article, we also discuss bias that can be introduced with using surface area as a metric to assess cooperation that results in weighting larger basins and aquifers over smaller basins in the calculation of the Indicator. This paper presents a basis for further analysis of SDG Indicator 6.5.2 and the possible adaptations of the Indicator design to better assess transboundary water cooperation.

AB Documenting the changing sources of water during high streamflows following rainfall is important for understanding catchment behaviour. This study uses tritium (H-3), major ion concentrations, and delta O-18 values to identify the sources of water that sustained streamflow in the upper Yarra and Latrobe catchments of southeast Australia over two high flow events in March 2016 and August 2016. The variations in geochemistry imply that direct contribution of rainfall to streamflow was minor. Rather, the baseflow that sustained the streams prior to the events was augmented by water derived from the soils or regolith. A two component mass balance based on H-3 indicates that the soil/regolith water constituted 60-100% of total streamflow at the peak of the events. A mass balance based on silica yields similar estimates (50-70%). The H-3 activities of the soil water imply residence times of up to six years. These are sufficiently long for evapotranspiration, dissolution of organic matter, and mineral weathering to increase the major ion concentrations above those of rainfall and for mixing to homogenise delta O-18 and delta H-2 values. This study helps resolve the paradox that the water contributing to high flow events in streams is commonly not rainfall but is unlikely to be only increased inflows of groundwater due to the time required for hydraulic loading to occur.

DE Evaporation; Bowen ratio; Multiple-point statistics; Time series

ID FLUXES
AB The application of the Bowen ratio method to estimate evaporation is heavily affected by uncertainties on the measured quantities. Time series collected with a hydro-meteorological monitoring station often contain measurements for which a reliable estimate of evaporation cannot be computed. Such measurements can be identified with standard error propagation methods. However, simply discarding some values might introduce a bias in the cumulative evaporation for long time intervals, also depending on the threshold of acceptance. In this paper, we propose the use of multiple-point statistics simulation to integrate the time series of reliable evaporation estimates. A test conducted on a two-year-long time series of data collected with a hydro-meteorological station in the Po plain (Italy) shows that the usage of a rejection criteria in conjunction with multiple point statistics simulation is a promising and useful tool for the reconstruction of reliable evaporation time series. In particular, it is shown that if the rejected values are not replaced by simulation, then the cumulative evaporation curves are estimated with a bias comparable with estimates of cumulative annual evaporation. Moreover, the test gives some insights for the selection of the best rejection threshold.

AB The goal of this study was to determine if assimilating a combination of various derived data products can help circumvent some of the difficulties associated with urban watershed modeling. Combinations of the SNODAS (Snow Data Assimilation System) snow water equivalent data, the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) L2 soil moisture, and streamflow observations were used for the data assimilation schemes. Combinations of these observation data sets were assimilated into lumped conceptual rainfall-runoff models of the highly-urbanized Don River basin (in southern Ontario) to determine if assimilation of geophysical variables will have a significant impact on simulations and forecasting in an urbanized watershed. The Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) data assimilation method was used for these analyses, with various rainfall-runoff models that include GR4J, HyMod, MAC-HBV, and SAC-SMA models. The best data assimilation scheme for hydrologic modeling involved using a combination of streamflow, soil moisture, and snow water equivalent while performing both state and parameter updating. These results suggest that using a combination of soil moisture and snow water equivalent from the SMOS and SNODAS data products can improve simulations and ensemble forecasts in an urban basin.

However, a global model is inefficient for accurately estimating soil moisture at a large or even global scale because of the complex surface features that make it difficult to fit data globally. Furthermore, inconsistencies in the spatial integrity between multisource data and the mismatch between the training space and application space decrease the generalizability of the model, which may lead to unreasonable soil moisture values in certain areas. This study proposes a "pyramid" framework that integrates multiple factors from different sources using the classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm, a machine learning method, to estimate soil moisture at a high spatial resolution (1 km). The framework considers soil moisture as a response variable and several factors, such as precipitation, soil properties, and temperature, as explanatory variables. The framework uses piecewise fitting instead of global fitting and avoids the generation of unreasonable values. A k-fold cross-validation approach using "hold-out" years was used to assess the performance of the soil moisture estimation framework for the summer period. The results show that the performance of the framework was relatively stable during the study period with low variabilities in the r values (1 STD < 0.06) and error measures (1 STD < 0.05). The results predicted based on the framework are more accurate than the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) results. The correlation coefficients between the TVDI and soil moisture observations in June, July and August were 0.49, 0.29 and 0.49, respectively, whereas those between the predictions and observations were 0.70, 0.68 and 0.69, respectively, which reflected increases of 0.21, 0.39 and 0.20, respectively. The spatiotemporal analysis of summer soil moisture from 2000 to 2014 exhibited a significant wetting trend; the spatial patterns were characterized by wetting trends over arid and humid regions and drying trends over semi-arid regions. The results indicate that the "pyramid" framework can provide a soil moisture dataset with reasonable accuracy and high spatial resolution.

AB There is increasing recognition of the need to incorporate the complex and dynamic interactions between society and water in studies of water resource systems. The study of human-water dynamics requires the involvement of researchers from different disciplines, including hydrology and social science. This paper tracks recent trends in socio-hydrological research using quantitative and qualitative methods. Bibliographic metrics and network analysis are used to identify general trends and illustrate the internal connections in this small but growing interdisciplinary field. Results show that hydrologists dominate research in socio-hydrology as presently defined, with far less participation from social scientists. Research questions for socio-hydrology tend to focus on system dynamics and are often not framed in a way that engages the interests and expertise of social scientists. A qualitative analysis addresses key barriers to the interdisciplinary development of socio-hydrology and identifies research needs and directions for better integration of the human dimensions of water science. Attracting social scientists to this field requires a broader conceptualization of socio-hydrology to focus on sustainable development, risk assessment, hazard management, resilience, adaptation, and knowledge mobilization in addition to hydrology's traditional focus on systems modeling and decision support. We propose three themes for thematic focus: systemic risk and natural hazards; sustainability science; and adaptive governance. This broader framing of socio-hydrology is inherently more interdisciplinary, brings new methods and viewpoints to the field, and ensures that place-based local values are included in studies of water system dynamics.

AB A colorimetric method based on the development of the yellow potassium iodoantimonite complex, previously developed for biological matrices, was applied to successfully quantify total Sb in contaminated waters that were collected from an Sb mineralised zone in NSW, Australia. The method showed good repeatability and little interference from co-occurring ions such as As (III), Ca2+, Fe (III) and SO42-. Field testing demonstrated good precisions and recoveries, making the method truly quantitative under the given conditions. The method's detection limit and limit of reporting (0.6 mu g mL(-1)), made it applicable in areas of high Sb concentration and for rapid response to Sb contamination. Preliminary investigations into extending the method to rapid Sb speciation screening was trialled using anionic SPE columns that retained Sb (V) and excluded Sb (III), in isolation and in combined solutions. Antimony (V) retention was compromised in the presence of ions such as Ca2+ and SO42- spiked at realistic field concentrations. Despite this, the coupling of the colorimetric determination with the anionic columns showed no gross interferences during field trialling, and the columns showed potential for rapid screening of Sb species, as well as rapid preconcentration of Sb from water samples. The latter process lowered the effective detection limit of the colorimetric method almost 10-fold. Both the colorimetric method and the combination of this with rapid speciation techniques show great potential for expanding rapid Sb analysis capability, applicable especially for screening water samples with known or suspected Sb content.

AB Most lumped hydrological models use areal average precipitation data as model input. Though weather-radar-based and satellite-based precipitation estimation methods have been proposed in recent years, the rain gauge is still the most widely used precipitation-measuring tool. Optimal selection of rain gauge number and location will improve the accuracy of areal average precipitation estimations with minimum cost. In this study, the impacts of rain gauge density and distribution on lumped hydrological modelling uncertainty with different catchment sizes are analysed. To this end, the performances of a lumped hydrological model, the Xinanjiang model, in a densely gauged river basin, the Xiangjiang River basin, and its sub-basins under different gauge density and distribution are compared. First, seven levels of rain gauge density are defined. For each density level, several samples of different rain gauge distributions are randomly selected. Then, the areal average precipitation of each sample is estimated and used as input to the Xinanjiang model. Finally, the model is calibrated using the shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA) algorithm, and model uncertainty is evaluated via the Bayesian method. The results show that 1) imperfect precipitation inputs measured by a sparse and irregular rain gauge network will lead to substantial uncertainty in model parameter estimation and flood simulation; 2) the impacts of imperfect precipitation estimates on model efficiency can be reduced to some extent through the adjustment of model parameters; 3) modelling uncertainty is reduced by increasing the rain gauge density or optimizing the rain gauge distribution pattern; and 4) the improvement in lumped model efficiency is no longer significant when the rain gauge density exceeds a certain threshold, but a further increase in rain gauge density will reduce model parameter uncertainty and the width of the runoff confidence interval.

AB Dissolved carbon in lakes play a vital role in the global carbon cycling. The concentration and dynamics of lake dissolved carbon can be influenced by both the surrounding landscape and a combination of physical, chemical and biological processes within the lakes themselves. From 2009 to 2016, we conducted a large-scale assessment of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in 249 lakes across a diverse range of climatic, geopedologic, topographical and hydrological conditions in five Chinese limnetic regions: the East Limnetic Region (ELR), the Northeast Limnetic Region (NLR), the Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Limnetic Region (MXR), the Yungui Limnetic Region (YGR), and the Tibet-Qinghai Limnetic Region (TQR). We found that the density of the organic matter in the soil in the surrounding landscape plays an important role in the DOC and DIC in lake water, as was evidenced by the high DOC and DIC levels in the NLR, where the soil is respectively organically rich. Conditions in the arid and semi-arid environments (i.e. TQR and MXR) have created a number of brackish/saline lakes and here we found that, DOC and DIC levels (median: 21.79 and 93.72 mg/L, respectively) are significantly higher than those in the freshwater lakes (median: 5.80 and 29.38 mg/L). It also appears to be the case that the trophic state of freshwater lakes influences the spatial variation of DOC. This can be seen in the relationships between DOC and trophic state index (TSI) in agriculturally-dominated regions such as the ELR (R-2 = 0.59, p < 0.01), NLR (R-2 = 0.65, p < 0.001), and YGR (R-2 = 0.78, p < 0.001). Additionally, a close relationship between DOC and DIC can be found in lake waters with different trophic states (eutrophic: slp = 0.63, R-2 = 0.69; mesotrophic: slp = 1.03, R-2 = 0.65; oligotrophic: slp = 1.00, R-2 = 0.64). This indicates that human activities influence the quantity and quality of dissolved carbon in inland water across China. This study is able to provide insights regarding the potential effects of climate change and changes in land-use upon the amount of dissolved carbon in lake water.

AB Over the millennia, peatlands have sequestered and stored carbon in the form of peat, that today accounts for around 30% of the global soil organic carbon. The peat has formed and accumulated due to the slow decomposition rate of organic matter in waterlogged, anaerobic conditions. The particularly close interdependence of the carbon and water cycles in peatland ecosystems signal the importance of understanding the water cycle to the functioning of peatlands.
   With this aim, the water and energy cycle of an alpine catchment in Italy, which includes a peatland, was studied using the process-based hydrological model GEOtop and a set of in situ measurements over 4 years (2012-2015). This is a challenging modelling exercise that has not been tried before with GEOtop. The catchment is heterogenous with land covers of peatland, grassland, scree and bare rock in a mountainous area. The GEOtop model was able to replicate the energy and water fluxes measured by an eddy covariance tower located in the peatland as well as the volumetric water content and soil temperature of the peatland accurately over the four years. This study shows that a process-based hydrological model can be used to study the water and energy dynamics of a peatland in a mountainous area.

AB Performance of environmental justice models depends on the level of accuracy in measuring or estimating the health of the environment. In the past decades, and especially in the area of stream health modeling, significant improvement has been observed. However, the impacts of these improvements on the robustness of environmental justice models have not been evaluated. Therefore in this study, the relative importance of parameter estimation in stream health based environmental justice modeling was evaluated. The Saginaw River Basin in Michigan was considered as the study area, and four major ecological indices evaluating the response of fish and macroinvertebrates to instream stressors were used for stream health assessment. Seventeen socioeconomic and physiographic indices were evaluated at three census levels of county, census tract, and block group. Then the ecological, socioeconomic, and physiographic indices were used in the development of stream health based environmental justice models. Results showed that incorporating ecologically relevant indices and a using two-phase modeling approach not only improved the performance of stream health predictive models but also reduced the sensitivity of environmental justice models to aggregation at different census levels. In addition, using improved stream health indices reduced the redundancy of the independent variables (socioeconomic and physiographic indices), where the total number of significant parameters was reduced from 171 to 115. Besides that, more robust and meaningful spatial dependencies were observed among stream health measures and environmental justice parameters at different spatial levels. In summary having a reliable stream health information is the key for development of robust environmental justice models as evidence by improving model predictability and eliminating contradictory results compared to previous studies.

AB Efficient waste-load allocation plays a critical role in improving water quality. In this paper, a Pigovian tax-based waste-load allocation problem generalized from a prototype in the Tuojiang River basin is proposed. To control water quality and resolve the conflicts between dischargers, a Pigovian tax-based equilibrium strategy for waste-load allocation is designed to provide an optimization method for water quality management that fully considers the Stackelberg game between the environmental regulators and the river system dischargers. The successful application of this model to the Tuojiang River basin demonstrates its practicality and efficiency. Sensitivity analyses under different tax rate settings are given to provide the environmental regulators with insights into the impacts of a Pigovian tax policy on the discharger's BOD removal decisions, as well as to identify the waste-load allocation trade-offs between costs and equity. Compared to conventional models, the proposed method has the ability to reduce pollutants and achieve equitable waste-load allocations. The results demonstrated that as the proposed method can encourage dischargers to improve emissions performance, it could be of significant assistance to environmental decision making.

AB The evaporation method (EM) is an effective technique for measuring soil hydraulic properties. However, the EM generally fails to measure hydraulic conductivity curves (K-h; K and h are the hydraulic conductivity and the pressure head, respectively) in the wet (low suction) range when the hydraulic gradient within soil samples exceeds the minimum accuracy of the pressure transducer. In this study, we developed a new experimental device that uses the EM to perform conductivity measurements in the wet range. By making two major improvements, we successfully expanded the measurable range of K-h to cover the wet range, enabling accurate and effective measurements. Firstly, the accuracy of the hydraulic gradient measurement was remarkably improved by the use of a differential pressure transducer. Assuming the minimum evaporation speed (0.18 cm/day at the center of soil sample), the estimated measurable range of K-h is up to 27 cm/day for any type of soil. That is, our device has expanded the range of K-h measurable by the EM by more than two orders of magnitude on the wet end. Secondly, our device can execute the saturated/unsaturated steady-state infiltration method (SSIM/USIM) and the EM on the same sample. This diminishes not only time and cost but also errors between different methods, ensuring good accuracy and representativeness. The range of K-h measurable by the USIM was determined to be more than 21 cm/day, which overlaps with the range measurable by the EM. As a result, our device can obtain consecutive K-h curves from saturation to the medium pressure range (-500 < h <= 0 cm) for any type of soil.

AB HYPROP (Hydraulic Property Analyzer) system works based on the simplified evaporation method, which determines soil hydraulic properties in the laboratory. This system simultaneously monitors the changes in weight of soil samples as well as the soil matric potential at two depths throughout a drying process governed by evaporation from the soil surface. In this study, we examined the performance of the pseudo continuous pedotranfer function (PC-PTF) to estimate the soil water retention curve (SWRC) using high resolution data measured by HYPROP system. The dataset consisted of 7963 measured water retention data points obtained from 81 Turkish soil samples from which 60%, 20% and 20% were randomly selected for training, cross-validation and test subsets, respectively. The best PC-PTF developed in this study with a mean absolute error of 0.023 m(3) m(-3) (a root mean square error of 0.033 m(3) m(-3)) and a correlation coefficient of 0.96 showed promising performance considering the typical performance range (RMSE = 0.034-0.085 m(3) m(-3)) for parametric PTFs estimating SWRC. The best PC-PTF used soil textural information, soil bulk density, the percentage of stable aggregates, soil organic matter content and the initial water content as the input attributes. PTFs developed in this study also ranked high among previously developed PC-PTFs (with RMSE ranging from 0.027 to 0.056 m(3) m(-3)) using sparse datasets collected via the traditional equilibrium approach (i.e. sandbox apparatus/pressure plates extractor). We, therefore, recommend further application of the PC-PTF approach for development of PTFs using high resolution data obtained by HYPROP system.

AB Riparian wetlands as both hydrological and biogeochemical hot spots often have a major impact on the release of solutes from headwater catchments. Numerous studies give some evidence of a rather complex interplay of hydrological and biogeochemical processes that is still poorly understood. This study seeks to address this challenge using a multivariate solute concentration data set from a small riparian headwater wetland. First, a non-linear variant of the Principal Component Analysis (Isomap) was performed in a preceding study to identify prevailing biogeochemical processes controlling water chemistry. Second, the scores of the components of the stream draining the wetland were subjected to a cluster analysis to identify typical biogeochemical patterns for different biogeochemical and hydrological boundary conditions.
   Four different clusters could be identified, which roughly followed a seasonal pattern, although modified by hydrological boundary conditions in the short-term. During the first three months of the year, Cluster 3 prevailed, indicating a discharge of rather unaltered shallow to mean depth groundwater. Cluster 3 was increasingly replaced by Cluster 2 and then subsequently by Cluster 1, indicating increasingly anoxic conditions, increasing denitrification and desulphurization, and increasing decomposition of organic carbon reflecting increasing biological activity and increasing water residence time within the wetland. However, stream water during stormflow after extended periods of low groundwater level in the second half of the growth season exhibited a very distinct pattern, represented by the fourth cluster. It indicated strong oxic conditions causing enhanced oxidation of sulphides, a corresponding decrease in pH values, and a substantial increase in the concentration of alkaline earth ions, manganese and in electric conductivity during the dry period.
   It is concluded that temporal variations in stream water chemistry clearly reflected the intensity of biological activity in the wetland, interacting with water table dynamics. Our results provide strong evidence for major effects of single extreme events like drought periods which are expected to become more frequent because of climate change.

AB Weather and climatic characterization of rainfall extremes is both of scientific and societal value for hydro meteorological risk management, yet discrimination of local and large-scale forcing remains challenging in data scarce environments. Here, we present an analysis framework that separates weather regime and climate controls using data-driven process identification. The approach is based on signal-to-noise separation methods and explanatory extreme value (EV) modeling of multisite rainfall extremes. The EV models integrate the temporal component of the weather/climate driver using semi-automatic parameter identification. At weather scale, the EV models are combined with a state-based Markov model to represent the spatiotemporal structure of rainfall as weather states. At climate scale, the EV models are used to search for drivers leading to the shift of weather patterns. The drivers are brought out in a climate-to-weather signal subspace, built via dimension reduction of climate model reconstructions.
   We apply the framework to a complex terrain region: the Western Andean Ridge in Ecuador and Peru (0-6 degrees S) using ground data from the second half of the 20th century. Overall, we show that the framework, which does not make any prior assumption on the explanatory power of the weather and climate drivers, allows identification of well-known and new features of the regional climate in a purely data-driven fashion. Thus, the approach shows potential to identify weather controls on precipitation extremes in data-scarce and orographically complex regions in which model reconstructions are the only climate proxies.

AB Many recent studies propose wavelet-based hydrological and water resources forecasting models that have been incorrectly developed and that cannot properly be used for real-world forecasting problems. The incorrect development of these wavelet-based forecasting models occurs during wavelet decomposition (the process of extracting high- and low-frequency information into different sub-time series known as wavelet and scaling coefficients, respectively) and as a result introduces error into the forecast model inputs. The source of this error is due to the boundary condition that is associated with wavelet decomposition (and the wavelet and scaling coefficients) and is linked to three main issues: 1) using 'future data' (i.e., data from the future that is not available); 2) inappropriately selecting decomposition levels and wavelet filters; and 3) not carefully partitioning calibration and validation data. By not addressing these boundary conditions during wavelet decomposition, incorrectly developed wavelet-based forecasting models often result in much better performance than what is realistically achievable. We demonstrate that the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) multiresolution analysis (DWT-MRA) and maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) multiresolution analysis (MODWT-MRA), two commonly adopted wavelet decomposition methods used in the development of hydrological and water resources wavelet-based forecasting models, suffer from these boundary conditions and cannot be used properly for real-world forecasting. However, by following a proposed set of best (correct) practices, we show that the MODWT and a trous algorithm (AT) can be used to correctly forecast target (e.g., hydrological and water resources) processes in real-world scenarios. In this vein, we contribute a set of best practices, which focusses on deriving "boundary-corrected" wavelet and scaling coefficients from time series data, overcoming the boundary condition issues and providing hydrological and water resources modellers with a justified and coherent strategy for developing wavelet-based forecasting models that may be used for real-world forecasting problems. We coalesce these best practices into a new forecasting framework named Wavelet Data-Driven Forecasting Framework (WDDFF) that uses a combination of input variable selection and data-driven models to convert "boundary-corrected" wavelet and scaling coefficients into forecasts of a target process. Through a real-world urban water demand forecasting experiment in Montreal, Canada, we demonstrate the superiority of WDDFF against benchmark forecasting models such as (non-wavelet-based) random walk, multiple linear regression, extreme learning machine, and second-order Volterra series models. For the same case study, we also show how the WDDFF provides realistic and accurate forecasts while a recently proposed wavelet-based forecasting model that adopts the (invalid) MODWT-MRA for wavelet decomposition provides incorrect and unrealistic forecasts. We conclude that WDDFF is a useful tool for forecasting real-world hydrological and water resources processes that overcomes the limitations of many earlier wavelet-based forecasting methods and should be explored further for forecasting different processes such as streamflow, rainfall, evaporation, etc.

AB Studies of moisture dynamics associated with major tropical rain activities with the aid of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic (delta O-18 and delta D) measurements in precipitation and water vapour are of current research interest. Here we present such measurements of rain and water vapour samples collected at two tropical coastal hill stations of southern peninsular India during April October, 2012. An apparent seasonal cycle is observed both in rain and vapour isotopes. Despite of the isotopic equilibrium observed between rain and vapour during the whole sampling period, it often deviates in sub seasonal time scales. Rain-vapour isotopic separation factors are lower compared to the equilibrium separation values during stratiform rain events of Indian summer monsoon, while the separation factors are close to the equilibrium values during convective events. This is possibly due to the decreased vertical mixing of moisture during stratiform rain events.

AB Non-rainfall events like dew or hoar frost formation are often neglected in the water budget, because either assumed to be too small or their determination requires time consuming and difficult measurements. These events supply in many dryland ecosystems a substantial amount of water, but their role for northern humid ecosystems is largely unknown. There is a general need to quantify the ecological relevance for ecosystems of the water amount from dew and hoar frost formation. Weighable precision lysimeters were used to determine dew and hoar frost formation for a low mountain range and alpine grassland site for the hydrological years 2013-2015.
   Together dew and hoar frost formation ranged on a yearly basis between 42.1 and 67.7 mm, which corresponds to 4.2-6% of the total annual amount of precipitation. In drier months dew and hoar frost contributed up to 16.1% of total monthly precipitation amount. In winter months dew and hoar frost formation contributed up to 38% to the total monthly precipitation amount. Our investigation suggests, that dew and hoar frost formation are of ecological importance during droughts as well as cold periods. The amounts and seasonal patterns of dew and hoar frost formation could be predicted relatively well, based on standard meteorological variables with the Penman-Monteith equation. However, our results also showed, that the surface energy balance model from Penman-Monteith underestimated the amount of dew and hoar frost during colder periods and specific meteorological site conditions (i.e. high wind speeds at night). The mean underestimation between calculated and measured dew and hoar frost on a yearly scale were 63.2% and 16.6% at Rollesbroich and Gumpenstein, respectively. Dew and hoar frost formation contributes substantially to the water budgets of a low mountain range and alpine grassland.

AB Using data from 22 catchments in Northern Finland, this study demonstrates how runoff prediction in ungauged high-latitude catchments can be improved using simplified conceptual models tailored to readily available data in the region. The newly developed current precipitation index (CPIsnow) model provides a parsimonious tool to predict streamflow in data-limited high-latitude regions. Use of current precipitation index (CPI) and runoff coefficient formulation in the soil moisture and response routine conceptualization makes soil moisture and response routine parameters in the model identifiable with catchment properties influencing storage, evapotranspiration, and infiltration losses. Most of the model parameters showed a significant relationship with observable physical catchment properties, climate properties, or both. This made it easier to estimate the values of the model parameters in an ungauged catchment with minimal uncertainty. The parameter functional relationships derived with catchment attributes produced equally good model results when applied to independent test catchments. Inclusion of snow-water equivalent records and use of multiple objective functions for both snow-water equivalent and runoff simulations in the model optimization process helped reduce the effect of parameter equifinality, thereby making it easier to determine the optimal parameter values. Ranges of parameter values are proposed for the CPIsnow model in relation to key observable catchment characteristics in the boreal zone, enabling application of the model in ungauged catchments in the region.

AB River bank erosion is controlled by a complex combination of factors and processes that play a main role in fluvial dynamics. However, the role played by lateral erosion in small low energy rivers functioning still needs to be better understood. This study deals with the characterization and the quantification of the bank erosion of a small low energy river of the Seine Basin (France) in periurban catchment where urbanization had led to an incision and widening of the bed in the past decades, using adapted monitoring surveys: erosion pins and Structure-from-Motion Photogrammetry. The paper provides an opportunity to compare reach-scale flux estimates using both techniques. Spatial and temporal variations in river bank rates were quantified over 16 months and the causes and controls of riverbank erosion were identified. The estimated morphological activity rate ranges from 117 cm/yr to 1 cm/yr, illustrating the very heterogeneous spatio-temporal pattern of bank erosion observed on the Merantaise River. Whereas a number of studies consider subaerial processes as the dominant processes, fluvial erosion was found to be the most significant causal process, and in particular the mean discharge of floods. However, the high local variability of the bank erosion of the studied river appears to be controlled by very local factors such as the bank angle, the presence of a berm at the bank-toe (providing protection against fluvial erosion), lateral supply (outlet of rainwater pipes) and deflected flow in the direction of the bank.

AB The prevailing opinion on the temporal origin of water in a hillslope stormflow hydrograph is that the pre-event water represents a dominant fraction. Such conclusion is usually based on hydrograph separation techniques using stable water isotopes (or other conservative tracers) in conjunction with a mass balance approach. In this study, a two-dimensional dual-continuum model was used to study preferential flow of water and transport of Oxygen-18 (O-18) in a vertical cross-section of a hillslope located in a temperate spruce forest. The effects of hydrodynamic mixing and the spatiotemporal variability of isotopic signatures on estimated pre-event/event water fractions in the hillslope discharge were studied by means of numerical simulation experiments. Pre-event and event water contributions to hillslope stormflow were evaluated using a two-component mass balance approach combined with the 2D flow and transport simulations involving real as well as synthetic O-18 signatures. Long-term simulations of O-18 transport in the hillslope segment were compared with the observed O-18 content in soil water and in the hillslope effluent. The results of the long-term simulations indicated significant mixing of pre-event and event water occurring near the subsurface trench and in the soil above the soil bedrock interface where the transfer of O-18 from the soil matrix to the preferential pathways takes place. Despite the dominant role of preferential flow in the generation of hillslope stormflow, the pre-event water formed 52-84% of total subsurface stormflow. The mass balance approach failed in partitioning the hillslope discharge into the pre-event/event water components for two thirds of the selected rainfall runoff episodes due to similar natural isotopic signatures of pre-event and event water. The analysis showed that spatially and temporally variable exchange of O-18 between the soil matrix and preferential pathways exerted a primary control on the estimates of the temporal origin of water in the hillslope runoff. It was demonstrated that the degree of hydrodynamic mixing in the flow domain played an important role in the interpretation of the isotope-based hydrograph separation.

AB The introduction of cash crops and the evolution of farming practices in the uplands of Southeast Asia have drastically changed the agricultural landscape of the region during these last decades. This evolution has significantly increased soil erosion leading to important on and off-site effects. A long-term multi-scale monitoring of soil erosion was initiated in the early 2000's in the Houay Pano catchment located near the city of Luang Prabang in Northern Laos to assess these effects and propose sustainable land management solutions. We report here the analysis and the modelling of the soil erosion measurements made during the whole period on 1m(2) plots for different land uses. As expected, land use has an important impact on runoff production and soil erosion. The mean annual runoff coefficient increased from 0.05 for established fallow (4 years) to 0.45 for old teak trees plantation (14 years) with intermediate values for crops. The mean soil loss followed the same trend with respect to land use, from 25 g m(-2) y(-1) to 3765 g m(-2) y(-1). These measurements confirm that established fallow promotes infiltration and reduces erosion and, at the opposite, teak tree increases soil crusting, lowers the infiltration rate and enhances soil detachment. The splash and wash erosion component of a process-oriented model developed for terrace erosion was used. This model describes the soil loss after a rainfall event as the product of an effective soil detachability, the rainfall kinetic energy, the runoff coefficient and different attenuation factors linked to soil surface features. The agreement is good, both at the event and the yearly scales. When aggregated by land use, surface features percentages have low standard deviations and soil detachability variability may be described by a log-normal distribution. This suggests that each land use has a unique signature in the erosion process given by the percentages and the distribution. We conclude that: (i) leaving the litter layer and an understorey in crops and trees plantations is the best way to minimize soil erosion, and (ii) the splash and wash model may be helpful to set up optimal agronomic strategies for a sustainable land use of Southeast Asia uplands.

AB The use of water temperature as a tracer has been widely utilized for characterizing the dynamics of water flow and heat transport in riparian zones. By using experimental approaches, we investigated the effects of water temperature, hydraulic head, and heat radiation on water flow and thermal dynamics in riparian zones through sand tank experiments, which simulate the dynamics of water flow and heat transport in riparian zones. Water of low temperature was pumped into the sand tank, and changes of temperature at different locations of the sand tank were measured. Temperature data was examined for three different water temperatures (4.0 degrees C, 6.0 degrees C, and 9.5 degrees C), two different hydraulic heads (25 cm and 45 cm), and two different radiation temperatures (no radiation and 22 degrees C). The thermal dynamic variation pattern in different types of water temperatures, hydraulic heads, and radiation combinations, was also analyzed using a HYDRUS-2D model. The temperature sensors, located near the inlet infiltration boundary, required a shorter time to reach the steady state, because the temperature declined more rapidly near the inlet. The effect of lateral inflow on the temperature gradient was obvious. The temperature gradient in the horizontal direction gradually decreased, and the vertical temperature gradient gradually increased. In the initial stage of infiltration, the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction was larger than the temperature gradient in the vertical direction, however, as time goes on, the temperature gradient in the vertical direction was larger than the temperature gradient in the horizontal direction. In addition, the horizontal temperature gradient of the top sand layer was less affected by the water temperature. The closer the temperature observation point of the same horizontal section was to the infiltration boundary, the higher the rate of temperature difference changes. Comparison of the predicted and observed thermal dynamics variation of the 2-D sand tank shows good agreement, indicating that the major mechanism for water flow and thermal dynamics variation was hydraulic head. The sensitivity analysis results illustrate that the model was most sensitive to hydraulic head (H), followed by Van Genuchten parameter (alpha), permeability coefficient (K-S), water temperature (T), Van Genuchten parameter (n), residual moisture content (theta(r)), and saturated moisture content (theta(S)). The variation of each parameter was linear with the change of temperature field. Parameters which were positively related to the temperature field were T, alpha, theta(r) and theta(S), which means the parameter value becomes larger as the temperature becomes larger, and vice versa. The parameters which were negatively related to the temperature field were H, K-S and n.

AB The Linearized Parabolic Approximation of the Saint Venant Equations is often used for flood routing, but the corresponding analytic solutions usually neglect the downstream boundary conditions. This is an issue because the presence of hydraulic structures at the end of a river reach, or natural morphologic conditions, may influence the wave propagation. In order to take into account realistic boundary conditions, namely a stage-hydrograph upstream and a stage-discharge relationship downstream, a new set of exact solutions of the Linearized Parabolic Approximation of the Saint Venant Equations with uniformly distributed lateral inflows is presented. This exact solution is demonstrated by using it as a building block in a simplified flood routing model, whose numerical results are compared with those supplied by laboratory experiments from literature. Finally, the new solutions are used to analyze the range of validity of semi-infinite channel models. The comparison shows that semi infinite channel models are accurate when convective effects are prevailing on diffusive effects, and the downstream boundary condition corresponds to uniform flow conditions. In addition, the results show that semi infinite channel models based on the knowledge of the upstream stage-hydrograph can predict flow depths better than those making use of a flow hydrograph, while being practically equivalent in predicting flow rates.

AB This study focuses on the identification of the lateral preferential flow at the hillslope scale and the estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast-flow region, K-s,K-f based on infiltration experiments carried out at different spatial scales (point- and plot-scales), and at different soil depths. The discrepancies between the considered scales were mainly attributed to macropore flow and the difficulty in adequately embodying the macropore network on small sampled soil volumes. Conversely, at the plot-scale, the sampled volume was sufficient to activate the macropore network. This information helped establish the usability of a given technique to determine the parameters describing the hydraulic properties of the soil in the matrix and fast-flow regions. While K-s data obtained from the Beerkan method with the Beerkan Estimation of soil Transfer (BEST) parameter algorithm (point-scale) were used to describe the matrix (K-s,K-m), the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast flow region was estimated using the soil block method (plot-scale). Estimated K-s,K-f values were one to three orders of magnitude higher than K-s,K-m. The overall decrease of K-s,K-f with the soil depth supported the hypothesis that the macropore density decreased as a function of depth, yielding higher macropore flow variability. The soil block method, in association with the Beerkan infiltration runs, allowed the estimation of the saturated hydraulic conductivity for the fast-flow region based on a relatively simple field procedure.

AB Spatial and temporal influences on the winter (December-March) stormflow characteristics of fifteen United States Geological Survey (USGS)-gaged watersheds in the Southern Blue Ridge Mountains are identified: (1) watershed-scale differences in geomorphology; (2) continental-scale teleconnections during periods of wetness/dryness (based on the relative amount of winter precipitation over a consistent 20 year dataset); and (3) land cover in the context of soil parent material (e.g., development on alluvium/colluvium). Multiple regression was used to determine how much variance could be explained in five hydrologic variables describing the flashiness of peak flow (three original metrics), total seasonal flashiness (Richards Baker flashiness index), and the ratio of total winter stormflow to total discharge (the stormflow index). Models were constrained to three uncorrelated (vertical bar 0.65 vertical bar) variables to prevent overfitting to the dataset. Average-, dry-, and wet-years were subset using the z-scores for winter precipitation derived from the 4 km monthly PRISM (Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) dataset, for the period of 1986-2006. Relief, slope, and landscape connectivity explain the majority of explained variance in all five of the hydrologic variables during all time periods. During dry-, average-, and wet-years, atmospheric circulation patterns (i.e., North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific/North American Pattern) explain more variance than total seasonal precipitation (PRISM), which is not true in the majority of the all-years models. Land cover explains only a small portion of the variance in regional stormflow and only when sub-divided based on soil parent material. Results provide a framework for connecting watershed-scale characteristics to regional- and continental-scale processes.

AB Rapid urbanization is considered to be an important factor that contributes to flood risk. Therefore, flood prediction in urban watersheds using appropriate runoff models is essential to avoid the harmful effects of floods. There are various storage function (SF) models such as Kimura, Prasad, Hoshi, and urban storage function (USF) models that have been widely used in different parts of the world as rainfall-runoff models in which the USF model was recently developed in Japan for the specific application in urban watersheds. However, the identification of an appropriate model remains challenging in the field of hydrology. Therefore, this study aims to identify an effective SF model for an urban watershed in terms of hydrograph reproducibility and from an Akaike information criterion (AIC) perspective. The SCE-UA global optimization method was used for the parameter optimization of each model with root mean square error (RMSE) as the objective function. The reproducibility of the hydrograph was evaluated using the performance evaluation criteria of RMSE, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and other error functions of peak, volume, time to peak, lag time, and runoff coefficient. The results revealed that the higher values of NSE coupled with the lower values of RMSE and other error functions indicated that the hydrograph reproducibility of USF is the highest among the SF models. Furthermore, AIC and Akaike weight (AW) were used to identify the most effective model among all those based on the information criteria perspective. The USF model received the lowest AIC score and the highest AW during most of the events, which indicates that it is the most parsimonious model compared to the other SF models. Moreover, uncertainty characterization of the SF model parameters was also conducted to analyze the effect of each parameter on model performance.

AB Skilful forecasting of monthly streamflow in intermittent rivers is a challenging task in stochastic hydrology. In this study, genetic algorithm (GA) was combined with gene expression programming (GEP) as a new hybrid model for month ahead streamflow forecasting in an intermittent stream. The hybrid model was named GEP-GA in which sub-expression trees of the best evolved GEP model were rescaled by appropriate weighting coefficients through the use of GA optimizer. Auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation functions of the streamflow records as well as evolutionary search of GEP were used to identify the optimum predictors (i.e., number of lags) for the model. The proposed methodology was demonstrated using monthly streamflow data from the Shavir Creek in Iran. Performance of the GEP-GA was compared to that of classic genetic programming (GP), GEP, multiple linear regression and GEP-linear regression models developed in the present study as the benchmarks. The results showed that the GEP-GA outperforms all the benchmarks and motivated to be used in practice.

AB Velocity distributions for open channel flows have been investigated using deterministic and probabilistic approaches. It is well known that the vertical velocity profiles in wide open channels (i.e. aspect ratio width/depth > 5) can be approximated by logarithmic velocity laws and power laws. Recently the entropy concept in the forms of Shannon entropy and Tsallis entropy has been employed to estimate velocity distributions in open channels with different aspect ratios. The accuracy of conventional velocity equations is highly dependent on their parameters that can only be estimated by empirical or semi-empirical analytical relations which requires either a good knowledge of velocity field and/or physical properties of the channel, such as topographic conditions, sedimentation conditions and boundary roughness. In contrast, the entropy based velocity distributions derived based on the least-biased probability density function (PDF) by treating time-averaged velocities as random variables are resilient regardless of the flow and channel conditions. However, a comparison of the velocity profiles computed using deterministic approaches and probabilistic approaches has not been rigorously conducted. Furthermore, the accuracy and reliability of associated velocity distribution equations have not been tested thoroughly using data sets collected using advanced techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive and comparative study to analyze the distinctions and linkages between four commonly used velocity laws and two entropy-based velocity distributions theoretically and quantitatively using selective laboratory and field measurements available in the literature, considering typical sedimentation and channel hydraulic conditions. Amongst all, Tsallis entropy based velocity distribution developed from a generalized form of informational entropy exhibits universal validity to sediment-laden flows in wide alluvial open channels, and is found to be superior to others to predict velocity profiles in large waterways with unmanageable rough beds.

AB Although umpteen studies are available in the hydrologic literature for modeling the contaminant transports under steady flow conditions, similar trend is not seen while modeling this process under unsteady flow conditions and, thereby, limiting their field application for pollution monitoring in semi-gauged rivers. In this study, three simple model variants, namely, VPMM-AD(Psi D-c), VPMM-AD(Phi D-f) and VPMM-AD(D-c) were developed for unsteady state contaminant routing by tight-coupling the physically-based Variable Parameter McCarthy-Muskingum (VPMM) flow-transport sub-model with the Advection-Dispersion (AD) contaminant-transport sub model. These model variants were extensively tested under unsteady and steady flow conditions using the numerical experiments, and USGS laboratory and real-world river application datasets considering the popular MIKE11-AD model as the benchmark. The study results revealed the consistent superior performance of the VPMM-AD(psi D-c) and VPMM-AD(Phi D-f) model variants over the benchmark model. The developed approach is a novel one as it is fully physically-based, free from numerical stability problem as the governing equations are solved iteratively, can work at meso-scale with the same computational space and time-steps in the flow and solute routings compatible with the spatiotemporal scales of observation, very simple to use, and do not compromise with the routing accuracy as encountered in the benchmark hydrodynamic model even with a fully implicit finite difference scheme.

AB Soil water availability has a strong role on vegetation conservation and biodiversity, particularly at vulnerable environments such as archipelagos, subject to significant temporal changes of climate and rainfall, which influence soil weathering and erosion processes. Few field studies on hydrology of volcanic islands in the Atlantic Ocean have been developed focusing on soil and water temporal dynamics and conservation, mainly because such studies require data with high temporal resolution, and also due to the financial costs involved with field data acquisition at such remote places. Considering the importance of soil moisture content to several hydrological processes and islands environmental sustainability, this study aimed to investigate the soil water temporal dynamics in relation to different rainfall patterns and also the rainfall erosivity and its temporal variation, and the resulting infiltration depths, during a typical hydrological period, in an experimental plot at the main watershed of Fernando de Noronha, in the Brazilian Atlantic Coast. Rainfall was recorded every 5 min, and soil moisture was intensely monitored by 16 moisture probes, installed at 10-40 cm and 40-70 cm layers, during three years, representing the typical local hydrological regime and seasons. Rainfall bursts pattern were identified and described. Experimental data allowed a hydrological model to be calibrated and validated, providing estimates of infiltration depths, which can be valuable for water resources planning and management. Hydrological patterns were determined for each erosive rainfall, depending on the precipitation peak position, as advanced, intermediate and delayed. The soil water effectiveness was also evaluated and related to the different rainfall patterns. Soil moisture is highest from April to June, close to saturation; whilst for the other months the values were close to the residual value. The rainfall erosivity in the archipelago was identified as moderate to strong, and the most frequent rainfall pattern was the advanced. Fast wetting-drying cycles during the rainfall events were observed, due to rainfall intermittency, evapotranspiration, and to soil hydraulic conductivity. It was observed the prevalence of high moisture indexes, with percentages higher than 40% (extremely effective level) for both investigated depths within the first 70 cm of soil, essential for plant water uptake. The observed rainfall erosivity highlights the importance of defining local strategies for soil and water conservation aimed at water security in the island. Based on a simulation model, which was successfully calibrated (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Index NS = 0.76) and validated (NS = 0.81) for periods in the wet season, high infiltration depths have been identified, which contributes to canopy conservation in the archipelago.

AB Marginal likelihood (or Bayesian evidence) estimation is the basis for model evaluation and model selection, which is the key research content of the uncertainty quantification of groundwater model structure. Recently, the nested sampling estimator (NSE) has been widely used as an efficient method to estimate the marginal likelihood. The Metropolis-Hasting (M-H) algorithm is usually used to explore the model likelihood space for NSE. However, M-H is inefficient in searching complex likelihood functions, especially for the multimodal distribution functions, because of the sampling structure of M-H algorithm. The multi-try differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (MT-DREAMzs) algorithm is effective and robust in searching complex probability space, and it is incorporated into NSE to improve the performance of marginal likelihood estimation in this study. In addition, the developed MT-DREAMzs-based NSE (NSE MT) is evaluated by comparing with several other marginal likelihood estimators including DREAMzs-based and M-H-based NSEs (NSE_DR, NSE_MH), Gaussian mixture importance (GAME) sampling and a new nested sampling algorithm (PolyChord). Based on three analytical functions (up to 100 dimensions) and one groundwater solute transport case studies, the results showed that NSE MT outperforms NSEMH in the convergence, efficiency and accuracy of marginal estimation, and NSE_MT is slightly more efficient and accurate than NSE_DR. The accuracy of NSE_MH, NSE_DR and NSE_MT deteriorates with increasing dimensionality of target distributions/model parameters. In addition, GAME sampling and PolyChord sampling outperform other three NSEs in the accuracy and stability of estimation for high dimensional (up to 100-variate) distributions, and PolyChord is slightly less accurate and stable than GAME. Compared with GAME and PolyChord, NSE_MT and NSE_DR are competent for less than 10-dimensional distributions with higher computational efficiency.

AB Rainfall-induced shallow landslide is a common geological hazard around the world that can pose serious threat to both lives and property. Previous studies suggested that rainfall induced shallow landslides always occurred either above the bottom of a downward wetting front in infiltration, or below a rising water table. This paper proposed a different mechanism of shallow landslides in a modelling approach. The comprehensive physics-based Integrated Hydrology Model (InHM) and the infinite slope stability model were employed on a virtual slope to simulate the hydrologic response and estimate the slope stability. Different failure mechanisms with various characteristics were investigated under diverse rainfall scenarios (i.e., various combinations of rainfall depths, durations and temporal patterns). The results showed a novel mechanism of shallow landslides: a significant vertical change in saturated hydrologic conductivity causes the accumulation of infiltrated water, and subsequently leading to an increase pore pressures and landslides in unsaturated soil layer. More importantly, this kind of landslide would bring larger landslide volume even with smaller total rainfall depths. This study expanded our understanding about landslides and had important application in alleviating the loss of lives and property.

AB Temporal variation of water in the vadose zone is important to understand processes such as solute transport and nutrient cycling. Measurements of soil water content (SWC) in the subsurface are less common than those near the surface and predictions using numerical models are limited by data availability. Wavelet decomposition of surface measurements of SWC could improve modeling of subsurface SWC by segregating features at different temporal scales and projecting them to the subsurface. The objectives of this work were to: 1) predict subsurface SWC using surface SWC and a combination of wavelet analysis and linear regression, and 2) investigate relationships between soil properties and the movement of soil water at various temporal scales, s. Climate data and SWC at various depths were collected from eight sites in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA. Soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity (k) functions of each horizon were optimized by comparing measured and predicted (using HYDRUS-1D) soil water contents. Each time series of SWC was decomposed into 50 scale components using the Mexican Hat wavelet and later reduced to 5 group components with minimal impact on the characteristics of the signal. Changes in the values of each group component with depth were represented with transfer coefficients that could be estimated with predictors derived from particle size distributions and optimized soil hydraulic functions. Prediction depth and saturated k were the two most important predictors for s < 256 h, while k at -10 kPa was the best predictor for 256 h < s < 724 h, and the median value of particle size diameters for s > 724 h. Subsurface soil water content can be reasonably predicted with the proposed approach, particularly when vertical movement of soil water is unrestricted.

TI Assessment of the impact of sea-level rise on steady-state seawater

ID SALTWATER INTRUSION; SHARP-INTERFACE; VULNERABILITY
AB Previous studies on the impact of sea-level rise (SLR) on seawater intrusion (SWI) are mostly based on the assumption of a homogeneous coastal aquifer. In this study, we extend those studies by investigating SLR-induced SWI in a layered coastal aquifer using the analytical method developed by Strack and Ausk (2015). We provide analytical solutions for steady-state SWI in confined and unconfined coastal aquifers, where both constant-head and constant-flux inland boundary conditions are considered. The analysis based on a three-layer aquifer indicates that in general aquifer stratification affects either or both the initial location and response distance of the interface toe. Specifically, for flux-controlled unconfined coastal systems, the toe response distance driven by SLR is a linear function of the hydraulic conductivity of the top layer and independent of hydraulic conductivities of lower layers. Using an equivalent homogeneous hydraulic conductivity (derived based on the initial interface toe location before SLR) would result in overestimation or underestimation of the toe response distance, depending on the hydraulic conductivities and thicknesses of the layers. For flux-controlled confined layered coastal systems, by contrast, SLR can not cause variation of the steady-state interface toe location, which is consistent with previous findings for homogeneous coastal aquifers. The interface toe location in head-controlled layered coastal systems is only a function of relative hydraulic conductivities between the layers. Moreover, the effect of the layer thickness on the interface toe location and response distance in the head controlled system exhibits a more complicated pattern than in the flux-controlled coastal system, as changing the layer thickness changes both the overall aquifer transmissivity and inland freshwater flux. The results obtained enhance the understanding of the impact of SLR on SWI, which could provide a first-order assessment tool for relevant practitioners.

AB A typical engineered flood protection for a community exposed to fluvial flooding is constructions of flood defense dedicated for public-wide protection. Over the past few years, there have been efforts to mainstreaming individual precautionary measures as to reduce risk of flooding. Consideration of individual protection measures alongside public protection measures is mainly to increase resistance of local communities to flood impacts whilst deliberating the spatial constraints of public protection measures and optimizing cost of adaptation. However, quantification of vulnerability and risk reduction of combined public and individual protection measures has not received much attention, far less a risk-based economic analysis. In assisting flood risk management decision making, a systematic approach to quantify vulnerability and flood risk of conditions with the combined protection measures is deemed crucial. This study proposes a methodology to assess vulnerability and flood risk of flooding considering combined public and individual protection measures, aiming for relevant applications in economic appraisal of local protection options. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated using a case study of a residential area of Teddington near the Greater London. A range of different possible levels of protection was also included to exemplify the usefulness of the methodology in search for an optimal protection level. The results show that the combined public and individual protection can reduce flood risk significantly. The study highlights that the methodology can serve as a tool for a practical and manageable vulnerability and flood risk assessment.

AB Statistical calibration of flow and transport models in unsaturated porous media is often carried out with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. However, the practicality of these methods is limited by their computational requirement, particularly when large prior intervals are assigned to the model parameters. In this work, a new operational strategy is investigated to alleviate the computational burden of MCMC samplers using results from a preliminary calibration performed with the First-Order Approximation (FOA) method. With the new strategy, the posterior distribution is approximated using a high-order Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) surrogate model constructed over reduced parameter ranges. The latter are obtained from the 99.9 FOA confidence intervals.
   Two challenging test cases are investigated to assess efficiency and accuracy of the new strategy. The first test case considers estimation of flow and pesticide transport parameters from a synthetic infiltration experiment. The second test case deals with the assessment of unsaturated hydraulic soil parameters from a real-word laboratory drainage experiment. The results of the proposed strategy are compared to those of FOA, of the standard MCMC method and of an improved MCMC method in which the sampler is preconditioned with draws from the FOA posterior distribution. For both test cases, the new strategy provides accurate mean estimated parameter values and uncertainty regions and is much more efficient than the other MCMC methods. It is up to 50 times more efficient than the standard MCMC method.

AB Underground pumped storage hydropower (UPSH) using abandoned mines is an alternative system to manage electricity production in flat regions. Water from an underground reservoir is pumped to a surface reservoir to store electricity in the form of potential energy. Later, water is discharged through turbines into the underground reservoir to produce electricity when demand increases. During this operation, the water hydrochemistry continuously evolves. It varies in order to reach chemical equilibrium with the atmosphere (in the surface reservoir) and with the surrounding porous medium and groundwater (in the underground reservoir). The hydrochemical variations may lead to reactions in the reservoirs and in the surrounding porous medium, causing potentially negative consequences for the environment and the system efficiency, especially when pyrite is present in the surrounding porous medium. In this case, pyrite oxidation leads to a decrease in pH and the precipitation of goethite or schwertmannite in the surface reservoir. The decrease in pH is mitigated when calcite is present in the porous medium. However, other concerns may arise, such as slight increases in pH, the precipitation of ferrihydrite and calcite in the surface reservoir, and the oxidation of pyrite and dissolution of calcite in the surrounding porous medium. Understanding the pH variations and the precipitation/dissolution of minerals is of paramount importance in terms of the environmental impacts and system efficiency. For this reason, this work investigates the main hydrochemical changes and their associated consequences when abandoned deep mines are used for UPSH by means of numerical modelling.

AB Sub-daily variations in the rates and dominance of the main controls of stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (production, mobility and instream processes) have the potential to create a subtle sub-daily rhythm of DOC variation in streams. We used high-frequency data, covering the spring-summer-autumn period, which included discharge, specific conductivity, pH, groundwater levels, temperature, evapotranspiration and solar radiation to investigate the interplay between factors potentially driving diel DOC cycles in northern catchments. We focused on a peatland dominated 1st order stream (0.65 km(2)) before investigating the propagation of the signals downstream to a 2nd order stream (3.2 km(2)), with a lower percentage of peat fringing the stream channel. DOC cycles in the 1st order stream had a median peak time of 14:00 h and temporally varying amplitude, with a median of 0.61 mgl(-1). Results supported the hypothesis that diel DOC cycles at the site are driven by hydrological processes, specifically the viscosity-effect theory: viscosity-driven increases in flow from the riparian area in the afternoon flush DOC from the peat to the stream. The temporal variability in the amplitude of the diel DOC cycle was controlled by antecedent temperature. Downstream, the did DOC signal was weaker, with around 4-fold lower amplitudes and minima in the afternoon. The lower proportion of riparian peat downstream appeared to reduce the influence of terrestrial processes on DOC cycles. In-stream photodegradation and decomposition likely became more dominant as connectivity between DOC sources and stream reduced. The study highlighted that even in climates such as the Scottish Highlands, where energy input is relatively low and precipitation frequent, sub-daily hydrological and biogeochemical rhythms occur. Unravelling the intricacy of such diel cycles is fundamental to fully understanding stream functioning and the global carbon cycle.

AB Floods are considered as one of the most frequently occurring natural hazards worldwide and are occurring increasingly frequent in recent decades. Flood risk assessment is an important tool for flood prevention and involves significant practical applications in flood risk management and flood disaster reduction. In the study, an integrated methodology is proposed by incorporating urban flood inundation model, improved entropy weight method and k-means cluster algorithm to evaluate urban flood risk. The proposed approach is data driven without considering classification standard of different risk levels, and thus provides a more reasonable and objective result. A region in Haikou, China is adopted to test the applicability of the proposed approach. Seven evaluation indices are selected by coupling the natural hazard index system and hydrological models. The index weights are calculated by an improved entropy weight method that integrates the entropy weight method and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Subsequently, the k-means cluster algorithm is used to develop the flood risk map in the study area. The results indicate that high risk zones cover 13.7% of total area, which generally exhibit higher inundation depth and lower elevations. The assessment result matches well with the historical data of flood events. The traditional cluster algorithm and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods are used for comparison with the improved entropy-cluster algorithm so as to validate the proposed approach for risk management. The result demonstrates that the proposed approach is feasible and exhibits the most reasonable classification result. The study outcomes provide a novel approach for flood risk assessment and can provide valuable information for urban flood management.

AB Regional Climate Models (RCMs) generate past and future climate simulations that serve as input for subsequent modelling of impact projections. The most recent coordinated regional climate modelling initiative, CORDEX, provides RCM data for Europe with increased spatial resolution (12.5 km for the CORDEX EUR-11 ensemble) and based on the new Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RCM data from the previous initiative ENSEMBLES had a spatial resolution of 25 km and was based on the SRES emission scenarios. In this contribution we explore the development from ENSEMBLES to CORDEX in a hydrological impact study for the Upper Danube, focussing on the representation of past climate and projections of the future for climate and resulting river discharge. We replicated a hydrological modelling framework, including RCM downscaling and bias correction, that used data of 21 ENSEMBLES RCMs under SRES A1B emission scenario (Kling et al., 2012), and now applied CORDEX EUR-11 data of 32 RCM simulations under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. Results with CORDEX show a small improvement in the representation of historical precipitation, but a decline in the accuracy of historical temperature simulations, despite the increase in spatial model resolution. The tendency of ENSEMBLES climate projections is reproduced with the CORDEX RCMs, albeit with slightly higher precipitation in the CORDEX data, yielding a less pronounced reduction in future mean annual discharge for the Upper Danube at Vienna. The previously identified change in discharge seasonality increasing winter discharge and decreasing summer discharge is confirmed with the new CORDEX data. Updating climate impact simulations in the presented rigorous replication framework allows analysing specific new information in the latest generation climate model data as well as crystallizing essential expectable patterns of change that need to be addressed in adaptation strategies.

AB To improve microbial water quality and to prevent waterborne disease outbreaks, knowledge on the fate and transport of contaminants and on the contributions from different faecal sources to the total contamination is essential. The fate and transport of faecal indicators E. coli and enterococci within the Betna River in Bangladesh were simulated using a coupled hydrodynamic and water quality model. The hydrodynamic model for the river was set up, calibrated and validated with water level and discharge in our earlier study. In this study, the hydrodynamic model was further validated using measured water temperature and salinity and coupled with the water quality module. Bacterial load data from various faecal sources were collected and used as input in the water quality model. The model output corresponded very well with the measured E. coli and enterococci concentrations in the river; the Root Mean Square Error and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency for Logio-transformed concentrations were found to be 0.23 (Log(10) CFU/100 ml) and 0.84 for E. cob, and 0.19 (Log(10) CFU/100 ml) and 0.86 for enterococci, respectively. Then, the sensitivity of the model was tested by removing one process or forcing at a time. These simulations revealed that the microbial decay, the upstream concentrations and the discharge of untreated wastewater were the primary factors controlling the concentrations in the river, while wind and the contribution from the diffuse sources (i.e. urban and agricultural runoff) were unlikely to have a major influence. Finally, the model was applied to investigate the influence of wastewater treatment on the bacteria concentrations. This revealed that wastewater treatment would result in a considerable improvement of the microbial water quality of the Betna River. This paper demonstrates the application of a comprehensive state-of-art model in a river in a data-poor tropical area. The model can potentially be applied to other watersheds and can help in formulating solutions to improve the microbial water quality.

AB Water security assessment based on the concept of blue versus green water is becoming widely accepted globally. Blue water is the combination of surface runoff and deep aquifer recharge while green water is the summation of evapotranspiration and soil water content (i.e. mediated by plants). Due to the tight coupling between land use and the partitioning of blue and green water within a watershed, an integrated geospatial modeling framework that links land use and watershed hydrological processes is needed to predict the consequences of future land use change on blue versus green water security. By loosely coupling an agent based probabilistic land use change model with a hydrologic model, we investigated the consequences of present trends of urban growth to identify potential future hotspots of hydrological change across a watershed in central New Jersey undergoing sub urbanization. The agent based probabilistic model, working at the scale of land ownership parcels, predicted that future urban development would be the result of forest, rather than farm land conversion. Using existing zoning maps, the housing unit density and human population of the urban growth areas was estimated. A consequence of the loss of forest land and increasing impervious surface leading was higher blue water but lower green water. While no severe blue water scarcity was observed, an increasing green water scarcity was found in some study area sub-basins. Such information will aid watershed managers' and policymakers' effort in sustainably managing water resources under changing land use and climate.

AB Karst landforms account for 10% of the Earths land surface, and it is well-known that water is a limiting factor for karst ecosystems because numerous underground fractures and conduits induce rapid drainage. Therefore, an understanding of ecosystem water consumptions (evapotranspiration) and environmental controls is particularly important for land management on karst landforms. This study compared the actual evapotranspiration (AET) characteristics and analyzed the controls of three agroforestry ecosystems by field observations using a refitted ventilated-chamber, thermal dissipation probes and micro-lysimeters in a subtropical humid karst catchment from 12th March 2015 to 26th May 2016. Results show that: 1) the diurnal transpiration curves of trees plateau at noon with low fluctuations at a high level, while evapotranspiration curves of grass and crop ecosystems present single peaks; 2) AET of the forest-grass mixed ecosystem (7.64 +/- 5.75 mnrday(-1)) was significantly higher than crop (4.24 +/- 3.35 mm.day(-1)) and grass ecosystems (5.78 +/- 3.53 mm.day(-1)); 3) AET of grass and crop ecosystems were most sensitive to temperature, while the forest-grass mixed ecosystem was more sensitive to leaf area index (LAI) than other factors; 4) AET of the forest-grass mixed ecosystem was more sensitive to deep soil moisture (>30 cm), while grass and crop ecosystems were more sensitive to shallow soil moisture (10 cm and 20 cm). This study suggests that soil water content was not key limit factors to AET in humid karst landscapes. However, LAI, which can be controlled by land management, heavily influenced AET rates and E/AET (E, evaporation) ratio through changing water demand.

It affects a multitude of fluvial variables such as flow velocity and sediment transport. Limitations in river slope data, both its availability and accuracy, constrain the fidelity of fluvial modeling, particularly at larger or global scales. Traditional slope calculation algorithms cannot accurately predict river slopes as these are based on cell-by-cell calculation, which is only suitable for hillslopes and small mountainous streams. This paper presents a methodology for calculating global river slope and a procedure to upscale it for relatively coarse resolution, suitable for global scale modeling. The methodology is based on a simple principle of calculating slope from elevation depression over the length of a river segment, which is automated to allow global scale calculations. Version 1.0 of the Global River-Slope (GloRS) geospatial dataset is introduced and shown to be a step improvement over a previous product (NHDplus for the contiguous United States) and compares favorably to observed slope data collected from the literature. Statistical analysis of Earth's continents and large basins highlights interesting spatial trends. A semi-empirical regression analysis between basin-average river slope and other basin-scale parameters show that terrain slope accounts for 67% of the variability in basin-average river slope, with average discharge, sediment load and basin temperature contributing additional improvements to global predictions of 3%, 4%, and 3%, respectively.

AB When restoring dryland ecosystems, growing biological soil crust (biocrust) may greatly change the redistribution of rainfall in layered soils. However, ecohydrological modelling studies generally ignore biocrust and thus, the ecohydrological effects of biocrust on restorations remain largely unexplored. Using a long-term restoration case (located in the southeast edge of the Tengger Desert, northern China), we developed an ecohydrological model with explicit consideration of the infiltration in three layered soils (biocrust, shallow and deep sand layers) to investigate influences of biocrust on restoration dynamics in drylands. The proportion of infiltration that reaches 'annual grass' (including biocrust and shallow sand layers, 0-30 cm) and 'shrub' layers (30-150 cm) with biocrust significantly increased and decreased relative to the values without biocrust, respectively. Meanwhile, biocrust significantly decreased soil water content in deep sand layer, but not in shallow sand layer. As more water was used by transpiration than evaporation, the ecosystem with biocrust reached a final grass-dominated state (high grass cover of 40%, low shrub cover of 4%) rather than a shrub-dominated state (grass cover of 3%, shrub cover of 20%). This study suggests that we need to account for the roles of biocrust on rainfall infiltration to better understand vegetation and restoration dynamics in dryland ecosystems.

AB Resilience is essential to the integrity of socio-hydrologic systems, especially when faced with stress caused by natural hazards and economic development. Nepal has seen both in recent years. The objective of this study is to construct and implement an indicator-based approach to assess socio-hydrological systems with new metrics to evaluate the influence of hydropower development. We adopted a conceptual framework in which resilience is a relative complement of vulnerability and dependent on adaptive capacity. The framework has eight vulnerability parameters: water variation, water scarcity, water exploitation, water pollution, natural capacity, physical capacity, human resource capacity, and economic capacity. Hydropower development was incorporated into a modified resilience framework to explore the socio-hydrological impacts. This holistic approach revealed that although hydropower development contributes to water stress, it can also increase adaptive capacity. In addition, this study strengthened the argument for indicator-based approaches to evaluating socio-hydrologic systems, particularly when evaluating hydropower development, which impacts numerous economic and hydrologic systems. This type of framework is particularly needed in developing countries, such as Nepal, where water resource development is rapidly increasing and changing traditional socio-hydrologic systems.

AB Communities in regions with seasonal rainfall face annual dry seasons, during which water shortages and conflicts between different water use sectors may erupt. These difficulties increase following wet seasons with low rainfall, such as in relation to El Nino events in the wet-dry tropics of Central America. Hydrologic data are typically scarce in this region, making the development of drought adaptation strategies challenging. Many communities in the region depend on groundwater as their primary water source. For instance in the Province of Guanacaste in Costa Rica, groundwater supplied 78% of the total domestic water demand in 2015 and groundwater recharge from the wet season provides the primary water supply for the subsequent dry season. In this research we present a 'groundwater recharge indicator' that can support water managers in preparing for seasonal droughts. We developed this tool for an aquifer in northwestern Costa Rica where we conducted hydrological monitoring of streams and groundwater levels for 2.5 years, obtained further hydrological data (groundwater levels from 2005 to 2016), and worked with communities to assemble water use data. We combined these datasets in a hydrologic model (the Water Evaluation And Planning system, WEAP) and modelled groundwater recharge from 2005 to 2016, permitting a characterization of the relationship between rainfall and groundwater recharge. The groundwater recharge indicator is based on this relationship, and allows estimating total groundwater recharge for a wet season from cumulative rainfall measured to date. The indicator permits water managers to assess if the current year will likely fall into a low recharge category prior to the end of the wet season. This information can then be used to trigger short-term adaptation strategies with the goal to 'bank' groundwater while surface water sources are still available in the wet season. This indicator-based tool was refined through feedback provided in local stakeholder workshops. We also assessed the overall accuracy of predicting end-of-wet-season groundwater recharge with cumulative rainfall to date, and found that after the first 2-3 months of the wet season, prediction accuracies are high, leaving 5-6 months of wet season to respond adaptively to the prediction. The indicator can help water managers to plan ahead, and communicate the need for water conservation (demand management) and consideration of other water sources such as rain and surface water (supply management). This idea is transferable to other communities in regions with seasonal rainfall, and can support decision makers in increasing the socio-hydrological resilience of communities to seasonal droughts.

AB Hydrological and non-point source pollution (H/NPS) predictions in ungagged basins have become the key problem for watershed studies, especially for those large-scale catchments. However, few studies have explored the comprehensive impacts of rainfall data scarcity on H/NPS predictions. This study focused on: 1) the effects of rainfall spatial scarcity (by removing 11%-67% of stations based on their locations) on the H/NPS results; and 2) the impacts of rainfall temporal scarcity (10%-60% data scarcity in time series); and 3) the development of a new evaluation method that incorporates information entropy. A case study was undertaken using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) in a typical watershed in China. The results of this study highlighted the importance of critical-site rainfall stations that often showed greater influences and cross-tributary impacts on the H/NPS simulations. Higher missing rates above a certain threshold as well as missing locations during the wet periods resulted in poorer simulation results. Compared to traditional indicators, information entropy could serve as a good substitute because it reflects the distribution of spatial variability and the development of temporal heterogeneity. This paper reports important implications for the application of Distributed Hydrological Models and Semi-distributed Hydrological Models, as well as for the optimal design of rainfall gauges among large basins.

AB We develop a semi-analytical model to calculate the entry pressure in rough capillaries based on an energy balance principle and wetting theory on rough surfaces. During the drainage process, we assume fluids form arc menisci at corners of capillary cross-sections depending on the apparent angle, and that there is a wetting phase film adsorbed on the rough surface depending on the wetting condition. A Logistic model is proposed to explain the contact angle dependence on the structure of rough surfaces. Then the capillary entry pressure is calculated by extended MS-P (Mayer, Stowe and Princen) method. We verify the model using the pseudopotential Lattice Boltzmann model and obtain good agreement between the analytical and simulated pressures. Taking capillaries with triangular sections with pillar pillar-type rough surfaces as example, we discuss how rough structures and contact angles influence capillary behaviors. The results reveal that both the wetting phase saturation and entry pressure of rough capillaries are larger than those in smooth capillaries under the same conditions. Moreover, the entry pressure is not sensitive to the roughness factor under strong wetting conditions and is much more sensitive to the pillar asperity height than the other structure parameters.

AB Evaluating the reliability of satellite and reanalysis precipitation products is critical but challenging over ungauged or poorly gauged regions. The Triple Collocation (TC) method is a reliable approach to estimate the accuracy of any three independent inputs in the absence of truth values. This study assesses the uncertainty of three types of independent precipitation products, i.e., satellite-based, ground-based and model reanalysis over Mainland China using the TC method. The ground-based data set is Gauge Based Daily Precipitation Analysis (CGDPA). The reanalysis data set is European Reanalysis Agency Reanalysis Product (ERA-interim). The satellite based products include five mainstream satellite products. The comparison and evaluation are conducted at 0.25 and daily resolutions from 2013 to 2015. First, the effectiveness of the TC method is evaluated in South China with dense gauge network. The results demonstrate that the TC method is reliable because the correlation coefficient (CC) and root mean square error (RMSE) derived from TC are close to those derived from ground observations, with only 9% and 7% mean relative differences, respectively. Then, the TC method is applied in Mainland China, with special attention paid to the Tibetan Plateau (TP) known as the Earth's third pole with few ground stations. Results indicate that (1) The overall performance of IMERG is better than the other satellite products over Mainland China, followed by 3B42V7, CMORPH-CRT and PERSIANN-CDR. (2) In the TP, CGDPA shows the best overall performance over gauged grid cells, however, over ungauged regions, IMERG and ERA interim slightly outperform CGDPA with similar RMSE but higher mean CC (0.63, 0.61, and 0.58, respectively). It highlights the strengths and potentiality of remote sensing and reanalysis data over the TP and reconfirms the cons of the inherent uncertainty of CGDPA due to interpolation from sparsely gauged data. The study concludes that the TC method provides not only reliable cross-validation results over Mainland China but also a new perspective for comparatively assessing multi-source precipitation products, particularly over poorly gauged regions such as the TP.

AB Sulphur plays a critical role in the biogeochemistry of wetlands. SO42- is the sulphur form that is most commonly assimilated by plants, and it is the medium of sulphur transformation in wetland ecosystems. The Caohai wetland is an important ecosystem on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, SW China, and karst water is the most important water source in this wetland. In this study, the compositions of multiple isotopes (delta(SSO4)-S-34 and delta(OSO4)-O-18) were measured in groundwater, river water and wetland water in the Caohai catchment to elucidate the solute sources and behaviours of sulphate. The results suggest that SO42- in groundwater is mainly derived from sulphide oxidation. Groundwater contributes a significant amount of sulphate to river water, and it is the main sulphate source of wetland water during the high-flow season. In contrast, rain water is the main sulphate source of wetland water during the low-flow season due to the reduction in groundwater recharge. These data indicate that groundwater is not only an important water source in the karst-dominated wetland catchment but also provides pathways by which sulphate is transported to the wetland. In addition, due to the effects of dissimilatory sulphate reduction in the wetland, the sulphate isotope composition in wetland water was higher than those in the groundwater and inflowing rivers, which indicates that biogeochemical processes in wetland ecosystems influence the sulphate content and composition in karst water.

AB As an extension of our recent study (Li et al. Taylor dispersion in wind-driven current. Journal of Hydrology 555, 697-707), an analytical study based on spatial concentration moments is performed on contaminant transport in a gravity induced open channel flow under wind effect. The zeroth to the fourth order spatial concentration moments are derived to describe the temporal evolution of spatial concentration distribution, fitted by the fourth order Hermite polynomials. In initial stage, convection dominates the contaminant transport, leading to a large non-uniformity of vertical concentration. As time passes, the contaminant transport gradually evolves to an asymptotic pattern following a diffusion-like model of Taylor dispersion. The combined influence of gravity and wind effect on contaminant transport is investigated: the tailwind effect will accelerate the development of Taylor dispersion as well as the transport of contaminant, while the conveyance capacity is weakened in a headwind circumstance.

AB Under the impact of intensive anthropogenic activities and in the context of global climate change, the hydromorphological processes of most lakes around the world have changed dramatically. Here, based on hydrologic and topographic data, we analyzed secular variations in hydromorphological characteristics and their influencing factors at Dongting Lake, the second-largest freshwater lake in China. The entire time series (1951-2014) was divided into four subperiods based on the anthropogenic modifications of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River, including the construction of the Lower Jingjiang Cutoff Project and the operation of the Gezhou Dam (GD) and the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). The results indicated that there were obvious stepwise decreasing trends in the annual water discharge and suspended sediment discharge (SSD) from 1951 to 2014. Seasonal differences in water discharge and SSD over the recent 60 years exhibited a tendency of "less flooding during the flood season and more drying during the dry season". Meanwhile, the deposition-erosion budget of Dongting Lake shifted from a deposition rate of 120 x 10(6) t/yr from 1951 to 2003 to an erosion rate of 2 x 10(6) t/yr with the serious degradation of the Ouchi and Xiangjiang deltas after 2003. The hydrological processes of Dongting Lake are dominated by different anthropogenic activities at different stages. The Jingjiang Cutoff Project is the main driver of the decreases in water discharge and SSD from 1967 to 1980. The operation of the GD along the Changjiang River and other reservoirs, as well as land-use changes in the Dongting Lake basin, should be responsible for the hydrological variations from 1981 to 2003. The high sediment retention rate, geometric adjustment of the channel, and flow regulation induced by the operation of the TGD are the main drivers for the hydromorphological variations in Dongting Lake in 2004-2014.

AB The preceding and succeeding precipitation (P-S-P) of a precipitation extreme often contribute to flooding initiated by the extreme event itself. In this study, the concept of event-based extreme precipitation (EEP), defined as a precipitation event (daily precipitation >= 1 mm for successive days) having at least one daily precipitation extreme (daily precipitation a the 99th percentile), is proposed to consider P-S-P of daily extreme precipitation. Further, the time distribution patterns, trends, and return levels of EEPs across China are analyzed based on a 0.5 x 0.5 degrees gridded precipitation dataset covering 1961-2016. The data demonstrate the EEP concept, that multi day EEP with daily extreme precipitation occurring late in the event is predominant in China except for the Northwest where single-day EEP prevails. Over west China, EEP is increasing and becomes more temporally concentrated. In the lower Lantsang River, along the southeast coastline and on the Hainan Island, the 20- and 50-yr return levels of EEP would exceed 300 and 400 mm, respectively. Moreover, global warming possibly induces more single-day EEPs in the Northwest. The EEP concept may help guide attempts to manage extreme precipitation on event basis, which is particularly useful for regions characterized by long-lasting extreme precipitation.

AB This study monitored four geothermal groundwater (TW) wells (Suanbo, Yuseong, Deoksan, and Seokmodo), four carbonated groundwater (CW) springs (Chojeong, Bugang, Shin, and Bangadari) and shallow groundwater (GW) in order to interpret the carbonating process from the seepage of CO2. In a bid to figure out the carbonated reservoir where CO2 mixing occurs, the CW samples represent the condition of the final carbonated water as natural analogues. The initial fresh water can be assumed to be the following depth: the deep aquifer with 300-700 m below the surface level (b.s.l) and the shallow aquifer to be below 300 m b.s.l. The pairs of hydrogen (82H) and oxygen (8180) isotopes indicated that all the groundwater samples had been recharged from meteoric water at various heights. The Delta 14C data of the TW samples present residence time from 1980 +/- 30 to 6400 +/- 30 years BP (before present) and the delta 13C data of dissolved inorganic carbon in the CW distributed from - 3 to -10460 range implying the mantle degassing effects. Regardless of seasonal variations, the TW samples and the CW samples were shown to be the Na-HCO3 type and the Ca-HCO3 type, respectively, indicating these aquifers remain in closed conditions. Based on the chalcedony geothermometer results, the carbonated reservoir of the CW samples were estimated to range between 43.08 and 83.13 degrees C, which were paired with the average temperature of the TW sites. In turn, the reservoir depth estimations taken by multiplying temperatures by geothermal gradients were estimated to range between 1.34 km and 3.90 km. Meanwhile, the in-situ data of the CW sites were estimated to range between 3.8 and 18.7 degrees C and between 263.7 and 488.7 mV of redox potential of oxidizing condition, which means there are the possibilities of shallow carbonated reservoir. In order to delineate the hydrochemical changes of the fresh groundwater during carbonation at a deep reservoir and a shallow reservoir, the PHREEQC modeling was conducted with 0.0001-10 mol L - 1 of CO2 mixing. As the CO2 concentrations increased, the TW and the GW displayed different ionic variations but the inland groundwater identically moved to the Ca-HCO3 type. The coastal TW can be reflecting the carbonation process of the coastal AZMI section, containing large quantities of salts. The carbonation of these samples is triggered by 0.01 mol L -1 of CO2 introduced into the reservoir but it still retained the Na-Cl water type despite a Log PCO2 of over - 0.5. The study results imply that there can be deep reservoirs and shallow reservoirs responsible for developing carbonated groundwater. It will be useful to estimate hydrochemical variations of groundwater resulting from the natural-artificial CO2 leakage.

AB This study aims at developing an inexact interval-valued triangular fuzzy based multi-attribute preference model (IVTF-MAPM) method for supporting the selection of remediation strategies of groundwater remediation. The introduction of interval-valued triangular fuzzy parameters into the attributes makes it possible for dealing with multiple uncertainties existing in many real-world cases, considering more possible values and expressing the decision making information more precisely. A attribute system which consists of fifteen remediation alternatives with respect to ten attributes in each period were taken into consideration assessment of the technologies for groundwater remediation. The pairwise comparisons between the alternatives were expressed by the valued preference model and the weights of the attributes were scored by interval Analytic Hierarchy Process. After the modeling formulation, a chlorhydrocarbons-contaminated groundwater management system was provided to demonstrate the applicability of the developed method. Final results showed that A14, A3, A9 and Al were placed at the top ranking levels for 5-, 10-, 15- and 20-years of remediation, respectively. Compared to the results conducted form FMAPM and MAPM, it is indicated that the significant impact of multiple uncertainties existing in the system is specified.

AB Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes intrinsically lead to various hydrological impacts especially on the outflow rate of the watersheds. This research investigated LULC changes and its effect on outlet runoff by detecting LULC changes location and severity via an inverse method for the Little River Watershed, USA. For this purpose, the Clark's conceptual Rainfall-Runoff model was applied to the delineated sub-watersheds of the basin to generate different outflows by altering the Storage Coefficient (SC) of the model for each sub-watershed as the representative of LULC. Then, the relation between SC values and outflow time series was simulated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) based models of artificial neural network and least square support vector machine. In this way, in order to ignore redundant information and reduce the dimension of input vector, Wavelet-Entropy (WE) values of the outflow sub-series were computed and used as the inputs of the AI model to compute SCs of the sub-watersheds as the outputs. The trained multi-output AI model as an inverse method could be then used to predict the SC values (as representative of LULC) of the sub-watersheds using the observed time series of runoff at the outlet. The obtained results showed that the proposed inverse method could reliably detect not only the location but also the severity of LULC changes by prediction of SC values in the coming future years. For validation of the method, a comparison was also performed between the obtained results and recorded changes via normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land use classification, extracted from Landsat images. The comparison approved the ability of the proposed method for LULC change detection in a way that deforestation and cropland increasing of the sub-watersheds from 1990 to 2013 were aligned with the SC reduction e.g., 26% decrease of SC for downstream sub-watershed versus 53% decrease and 21% increase of forest and crop lands, respectively.

AB Mechanical thermal dispersion has often been neglected or underestimated in the simulation of heat transport in porous media, e.g., by using zero or the default value in simulators, or by using the scaling law for solute dispersivity as a thermal dispersivity value. However, large amounts of water usually injected in groundwater heat pump (GWHP) systems may increase the groundwater flow velocity much faster than natural flow and thus change the importance of mechanical dispersion in heat transport. In this study, to investigate the effects of water injection on the flow field, thermal dispersion coefficient, and associated heat transport process, a laboratory experiment using two different heat sources as tracers was performed at various background flow velocities (Re < 0.52). The analysis results from analytical and numerical models indicate that injected water increases both flow velocities and thermal dispersion coefficients, especially near the injection well, and thus makes the effect of mechanical dispersion on heat transport very important even at low background flow velocity. This result was also found in the field-based modeling results, but the radius of hydraulic and thermal effects was larger. In particular, thermal dispersivity on a field scale is known to increase depending on the scale of measurement and the degree of aquifer heterogeneity. Therefore, to ensure the efficiency and sustainability in field applications such as GWHP systems, it is necessary to evaluate site-specific thermal dispersivity through field experiments.

AB The feasibility of simulating the hydrological response of a grass swale to runoff inflows was examined using the hydrological model Mike SHE and the available input data from 12 irrigation events mimicking runoff from block rainfalls. The test swale channel had a trapezoidal cross-section, bottom slope of 1.5%, length of 30 m, and was built in loamy fine sand. The irrigation events consisted in releasing two equal constant inflows to the swale: a concentrated longitudinal flow at the upstream end and a distributed lateral inflow along the swale side slope adjacent to the contributing drainage area. The total inflows approximated runoff from two events with return periods of 2 months and 3 years, respectively, for durations of 30 min. Irrigation experiments were done for two states of the initial soil moisture, dry or wet antecedent moisture conditions (AMC). Mike SHE has been extensively used on catchments of various sizes, but rarely for small stormwater management facilities and their detailed topography investigated in this study. The latter application required high spatial and temporal resolutions, with computational cells of 0.2 x 0.2 m and time steps as short as 0.6 s to avoid computational instabilities. For dominant hydrological processes, the following computational options in Mike SHE were chosen: Soil infiltration - the van Genuchten equation, unsaturated zone flow - the one-dimensional Richards equation, and overland flow - the diffusive wave approximation of the St. Venant equations. For study purposes, the model was calibrated for single events representing one of four combinations of low and high inflows, and dry and wet AMC, and then applied to the remaining 11 events. This was complemented by calibration for two events, representing high inflow on wet AMC and low inflow in dry AMC. The goodness of fit was statistically assessed for observed and simulated peak flows, hydrograph volumes, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiencies (NSE), and soil water content (SWC) in swale soil layers. The best fit (NSE > 0.8) was obtained for high inflows and wet AMC (i.e., when the primary swale function is flow conveyance); the least fit was noted for low inflows and dry AMC, when the primary swale function is flow attenuation. Furthermore, this observation indicates the overall importance of correct modelling of the soil infiltration. The effects of spatial variation of SWC on the swale discharge hydrograph could not be confirmed from simulation results, but high topographical accuracy was beneficial for reproducing well the locations of the observed water ponding. No significant increases in simulated SWC at 0.3 m or greater depths were noted, which agreed with field observations. Overall, the results indicated that Mike SHE was effective in process-oriented small-scale modelling of grass swale flow hydrographs.

AB Chaos theory is integrated with Multi-Gene Genetic Programming (MGGP) engine as a new hybrid model for river flow forecasting. This is to be referred to as Chaos-MGGP and its performance is tested using daily historic flow time series at four gauging stations in two countries with a mix of both intermittent and perennial rivers. Three models are developed: (i) Local Prediction Model (LPM); (ii) standalone MGGP; and (iii) Chaos-MGGP, where the first two models serve as the benchmark for comparison purposes. The Phase-Space Reconstruction (PSR) parameters of delay time and embedding dimension form the dominant input signals derived from original time series using chaos theory and these are transferred to Chaos-MGGP. The paper develops a procedure to identify global optimum values of the PSR parameters for the construction of a regression-type prediction model to implement the Chaos-MGGP model. The inter-comparison of the results at the selected four gauging stations shows that the Chaos-MGGP model provides more accurate forecasts than those of stand-alone MGGP or LPM models.

AB A number of previous studies have examined relations between groundwater levels and hydrologic and meteorological variables over parts of the glacial aquifer system, but systematic analyses across the entire U.S. glacial aquifer system are lacking. We tested correlations between monthly groundwater levels measured at 1043 wells in the U.S. glacial aquifer system considered to be minimally influenced by human disturbance and selected hydrologic and meteorological variables with the goal of extending historical groundwater records where there were strong correlations. Groundwater levels in the East region correlated most strongly with short-term (1 and 3 month) averages of hydrologic and meteorological variables, while those in the Central and West Central regions yielded stronger correlations with hydrologic and meteorological variables averaged over longer time intervals (6-12 months). Variables strongly correlated with high and low annual groundwater levels were identified as candidate records for use in statistical linear models as a means to fill in and extend historical high and low groundwater levels respectively. Overall, 37.4% of study wells meeting data criteria had successful models for high and (or) low groundwater levels; these wells shared characteristics of relatively higher local precipitation, higher local land-surface slope, lower amounts of clay within the surficial sediments, and higher base-flow index. Streamflow and base flow served as explanatory variables in about two thirds of both high- and low-groundwater-level models in all three regions, and generally yielded more and better models compared to precipitation and Palmer Drought Severity Index. The use of variables such as streamflow with substantially longer and more complete records than those of groundwater wells provide a means for placing contemporary groundwater levels in a longer historical context and can support site-specific analyses such as groundwater modeling.

AB Low-lying coastal regions are often highly populated, constitute sensitive habitats and are at the same time exposed to challenging hydrological environments due to surface flooding from storm events and saltwater intrusion, which both may affect drinking water supply from shallow and deeper aquifers. Near the Wadden Sea at the border of Southern Denmark and Northern Germany, the hydraulic system (connecting groundwater, river water, and the sea) was altered over centuries (until the 19th century) by e.g. the construction of dikes and drains to prevent flooding and allow agricultural use. Today, massive saltwater intrusions extend up to 20 km inland. In order to understand the regional flow, a methodological approach was developed that combined: (1) a highly-resolved voxel geological model, (2) a similar to 1 million node groundwater model with 46 hydrofacies coupled to rivers, drains and the sea, (3) Tikhonov regularization calibration using hydraulic heads and average stream discharges as targets and (4) parameter uncertainty analysis. It is relatively new to use voxel models for constructing geological models that often have been simplified to stacked, pseudo-3D layer geology. The study is therefore one of the first to combine a voxel geological model with state-of-the-art flow calibration techniques. The results show that voxel geological modelling, where lithofacies information are transferred to each volumetric element, is a useful method to preserve 3D geological heterogeneity on a local scale, which is important when distinct geological features such as buried valleys are abundant. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that simpler geological models and simpler calibration methods do not perform as well. The proposed approach is applicable to many other systems, because it combines advanced and flexible geological modelling and flow calibration techniques. This has led to new insights in the regional flow patterns and especially about water cycling in the marsh area near the coast based on the ability to define six predictive scenarios from the linear analysis of parameter uncertainty. The results show that the coastal system near the Danish-German border is mainly controlled by flow in the two aquifers separated by a thick clay layer, and several deep high-permeable buried valleys that connect the sea with the interior and the two aquifers. The drained marsh area acts like a huge regional sink limiting submarine groundwater discharge. With respect to water balance, the greatest sensitivity to parameter uncertainty was observed in the drained marsh area, where some scenarios showed increased flow of sea water into the interior and increased drainage. We speculate that the massive salt water intrusion may be caused by a combination of the preferential pathways provided by the buried valleys, the marsh drainage and relatively high hydraulic conductivities in the two main aquifers as described by one of the scenarios. This is currently under investigation by using a salt water transport model.

AB Targeting nonpoint source (NPS) pollution hot spots is of vital importance for placement of best management practices (BMPs). Although physically-based watershed models have been widely used to estimate nutrient emissions, connections between nutrient abatement and compliance of water quality standards have been rarely considered in NPS hotspot ranking, which may lead to ineffective decision-making. It's critical to develop a strategy to identify priority management areas (PMAs) based on water quality response to nutrient load mitigation. A water quality constrained PMA identification framework was thereby proposed in this study, based on the simulation-optimization approach with ideal load reduction (ILR-SO). It integrates the physically-based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and an optimization model under constraints of site-specific water quality standards. To our knowledge, it was the first effort to identify PMAs with simulation-based optimization. The SWAT model was established to simulate temporal and spatial nutrient loading and evaluate effectiveness of pollution mitigation. A metamodel was trained to establish a quantitative relationship between sources and water quality. Ranking of priority areas is based on required nutrient load reduction in each sub-watershed targeting to satisfy water quality standards in waterbodies, which was calculated with genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed approach was used for identification of PMAs on the basis of diffuse total phosphorus (TP) in Lake Dianchi Watershed, one of the three most eutrophic large lakes in China. The modeling results demonstrated that 85% of diffuse TP came from 30% of the watershed area. Compared with the two conventional targeting strategies based on overland nutrient loss and instream nutrient loading, the ILR-SO model identified distinct PMAs and narrowed down the coverage of management areas. This study addressed the urgent need to incorporate water quality response into PMA identification and showed that the ILR-SO approach is effective to guide watershed management for aquatic ecosystem restoration.

AB Since the late 1990s, lakes in the southern Tibetan Plateau (TP) have shrunk considerably, which contrasts with the rapid expansion of lakes in the interior TP. Although these spatial trends have been well documented, the underlying hydroclimatic mechanisms are not well understood. Since 2013, we have carried out comprehensive water budget observations at Paiku Co, an alpine lake in the central Himalayas. In this study, we investigate water storage and lake level changes on seasonal to decadal time scales based on extensive in-situ measurements and satellite observations. Bathymetric surveys show that Paiku Co has a mean and maximum water depth of 41.1 m and 72.8 m, respectively, and its water storage was estimated to be 109.3 x 10(8) m(3) in June 2016. On seasonal scale between 2013 and 2017, Paiku Co's lake level decreased slowly between January and May, increased considerably between June and September, and then decreased rapidly between October and January. On decadal time scale, Paiku Co's lake level decreased by 3.7 +/- 0.3 m and water storage reduced by (10.2 +/- 0.8) x 10(8) m(3) between 1972 and 2015, accounting for 8.5% of the total water storage in 1972. This change is consistent with a trend towards drier conditions in the Himalaya region during the recent decades. In contrast, glacial lakes within Paiku Co's basin expanded rapidly, indicating that, unlike Paiku Co, glacial meltwater was sufficient to compensate the effect of the reduced precipitation.

ID WAVE-FORM RELAXATION; STATE; CONTEXT
AB In the context of hydrodynamic modeling, the use of 2D models is adapted in areas where the flow is not monodimensional (confluence zones, flood plains). Nonetheless the lack of field data and the computational cost constraints limit the extensive use of 2D models for operational flood forecasting. Multi-dimensional coupling offers a solution with ID models where the flow is mono-dimensional and with local 2D models where needed. This solution allows for the representation of complex processes in 2D models, while the simulated hydraulic state is significantly better than that of the full ID model. In this study, coupling is implemented between three ID sub-models and a local 2D model for a confluence on the Adour river (France). A Schwarz algorithm is implemented to guarantee the continuity of the variables at the 1D/2D interfaces while in situ observations are assimilated in the ID sub-models to improve results and forecasts in operational mode as carried out by the French flood forecasting services. An implementation of the coupling and data assimilation (DA) solution with domain decomposition and task/data parallelism is proposed so that it is compatible with operational constraints. The coupling with the 2D model improves the simulated hydraulic state compared to a global ID model, and DA improves results in 1D and 2D areas.

AB Soil moisture dynamics plays an active role in ecological and hydrological processes, and it depends on a large number of environmental factors, such as topographic attributes, soil properties, land use types, and precipitation. However, studies must still clarify the relative significance of these environmental factors at different soil depths and at different spatial scales. This study aimed: (1) to characterize temporal and spatial variations in soil moisture content (SMC) at four soil layers (0-40, 40-100, 100-200, and 200-500 cm) and three spatial scales (plot, hillslope, and region); and (2) to determine their dominant controls in diverse soil layers at different spatial scales over semiarid and semi-humid areas of the Loess Plateau, China. Given the high co-dependence of environmental factors, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to detect relative significance among 15 selected environmental factors that affect SMC. Temporal variation in SMC decreased with increasing soil depth, and vertical changes in the 0-500 cm soil profile were divided into a fast-changing layer (0-40 cm), an active layer (40-100 cm), a sub-active layer (100-200 cm), and a relatively stable layer (200-500 cm). PLSR models simulated SMC accurately in diverse soil layers at different scales; almost all values for variation in response (R-2) and goodness of prediction (Q(2)) were > 0.5 and > 0.0975, respectively. Upper and lower layer SMCs were the two most important factors that influenced diverse soil layers at three scales, and these SMC variables exhibited the highest importance in projection (VIP) values. The 7-day antecedent precipitation and 7-day antecedent potential evapotranspiration contributed significantly to SMC only at the 0-40 cm soil layer. VIP of soil properties, especially sand and silt content, which influenced SMC strongly, increased significantly after increasing the measured scale. Mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration also influenced SMC at the regional scale significantly. Overall, this study indicated that dominant controls of SMC varied among three spatial scales on the Loess Plateau, and VIP was a function of spatial scale and soil depth.

AB Ensemble Kalman (EnKF) filtering is an established framework for large scale state estimation problems. EnKFs can also be used for state-parameter estimation, using the so-called "Joint-EnKF" approach. The idea is simply to augment the state vector with the parameters to be estimated and assign invariant dynamics for the time evolution of the parameters. In this contribution, we investigate the efficiency of the Joint-EnKF for estimating spatially-varying Manning's n coefficients used to define the bottom roughness in the Shallow Water Equations (SWEs) of a coastal ocean model.
   Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) are conducted using the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) model, which solves a modified form of the Shallow Water Equations. A deterministic EnKF, the Singular Evolutive Interpolated Kalman (SEIK) filter, is used to estimate a vector of Manning's n coefficients defined at the model nodal points by assimilating synthetic water elevation data. It is found that with reasonable ensemble size (O(10)), the filter's estimate converges to the reference Manning's field. To enhance performance, we have further reduced the dimension of the parameter search space through a Karhunen-Loeve (KL) expansion. We have also iterated on the filter update step to better account for the nonlinearity of the parameter estimation problem. We study the sensitivity of the system to the ensemble size, localization scale, dimension of retained KL modes, and number of iterations. The performance of the proposed framework in term of estimation accuracy suggests that a well-tuned Joint-EnKF provides a promising robust approach to infer spatially varying seabed roughness parameters in the context of coastal ocean modeling.

ID ENHANCED PREDICTIONS; FLOODS; DISCHARGE
AB Prediction of peak discharge of floods has attracted great attention for researchers and engineers. In present study, nine typical nonlinear mathematical models are established based on database of 40 historical dam failures. The first eight models that were developed with a series of regression analyses are purely empirical, while the last one is a semi-analytical approach that was derived from an analytical solution of dam-break floods in a trapezoidal channel. Water depth above breach invert (H-w), volume of water stored above breach invert (V-w), embankment length (E-l), and average embankment width (E-w) are used as independent variables to develop empirical formulas of estimating the peak outflow from breached embankment dams. It is indicated from the multiple regression analysis that a function using the former two variables (i.e., H-w and V-w) produce considerably more accurate results than that using latter two variables (i.e., E-L and E-w). It is shown that the semianalytical approach works best in terms of both prediction accuracy and uncertainty, and the established empirical models produce considerably reasonable results except the model only using E-l. Moreover, present models have been compared with other models available in literature for estimating peak discharge.

AB Pines in semi-arid mountain environments manage to survive and thrive despite the limited soil water, due to shallow soil depths, and overall water scarcity. This study aims to develop a method for computing soil evaporation, bedrock water uptake and transpiration from a natural, open forest, based on sap flow (Heat Ratio Method), soil moisture and meteorological observations. The water balance of individual trees was conceptualized with a geometric approach, using canopy projected areas and Voronoi (Thiesen) polygons. The canopy approach assumes that the tree's root area extent is equal to its canopy projected area, while the Voronoi approach assumes that the tree roots exploit the open area that is closer to the tree than to any other tree. The methodology was applied in an open Pinus brutia forest (68% canopy cover) in Cyprus, characterized by steep slopes and fractured bedrock, during two hydrologically contrasting years (2015 wet, 2016 dry). Sap flow sensors, soil moisture sensors, throughfall and stemflow gauges were installed on and around eight trees. Rainfall was 507 mm in 2015 and 359 mm in 2016. According to the canopy approach, the sum of tree transpiration and soil evaporation exceeded the throughfall in both years, which implies that the trees' bedrock water uptake exceeds the surface runoff and drainage losses. This indicated that trees extend their roots beyond the canopy-projected areas and the use of the Voronoi polygons captures this effect. According to the stand scale water balance, average throughfall during the two years was 81% of the rainfall. Transpiration was 61% of the rainfall in 2015, but only 32% in 2016. On the contrary, the soil evaporation fraction increased from 26% in 2015 to 35% in the dry year of 2016. The contribution of bedrock water to tree transpiration was 77% of rainfall in 2015 and 66% in 2016. During the summer months, trees relied 100% on the uptake of water from the fractured bedrock to cover their transpiration needs. Average monthly transpiration areas ranged between 0.1 mm d(-1) in October 2016 and 1.7 mm d(-1) in April 2015. This study shows that bedrock uptake could be an essential water balance component of semi-arid, mountainous pine forests and should be accounted for in hydrologic models.

AB Fluid flow through highly porous media is important in a variety of science and technology fields, including hydrology, chemical engineering, convections in porous media, and others. While many methods have been available to measure the permeability of tight solid materials, such as concrete and rock, the technique for measuring the permeability of highly porous media is limited (such as gravel, aggregated soils, and crushed rock). This study proposes a new simplified method for measuring the permeability of highly porous media with a permeability of 10(-8)-10(-4)m(2), using a Venturi tube to gauge the gas flowing rate through the sample. Using crushed rocks and glass beads as the test media, we measure the permeability and inertial resistance factor of six types of single-size aggregate columns. We compare the testing results with the published permeability and inertial resistance factor of crushed rock and of glass beads. We found that in a log-log graph, the permeability and inertial resistance factor of a single-size aggregate heap increases linearly with the mean diameter of the aggregate. We speculate that the proposed simplified method is suitable to efficiently test the permeability and inertial resistance factor of a variety of porous media with an intrinsic permeability of 10(-8)-10(-4)m(2).

AB Recent studies based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission suggested that groundwater has increased in central and southern parts of India. However, surface water, which is an equally important source of water in these semi-arid areas has not been studied yet. In the present study, the study areas were outlined based on trends in GRACE data followed by trend identification in surface water storages and checking the hypothesis of causality. Surface Water Extent (SWE) and Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) derived from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer -Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) respectively, are selected as proxies of surface water storage (SWS). Besides SWE and SSM, trend test was performed for GRACE derived terrestrial water storage (TWS) for the study areas named as R1, R2, GOR1 and KOR1. Granger-causality test is used to test the hypothesis that rainfall is a causal factor of the inter-annual variability of SWE, SSM and TWS. Positive trends were observed in TWS for R1, R2 and GOR1 whereas SWE and SSM show increasing trends for all the study regions. Results suggest that rainfall is the granger-causal of all the storage variables for R1 and R2, the regions exhibiting the most significant positive trends in TWS.

AB Reservoir operations significantly alter the hydrological regime of the downstream river and river-connected lake, which has far-reaching impacts on the lake ecosystem. To facilitate the management of lakes connected to regulated rivers, the following information must be provided: (1) the response of lake water levels to reservoir operation schedules in the near future and (2) the importance of different rivers in terms of affecting the water levels in different lake regions of interest. We develop an integrated modeling and analytical methodology for the water level management of such lakes. The data-driven method is used to model the lake level as it has the potential of producing quick and accurate predictions. A new genetic algorithm-based synchronized search is proposed to optimize input variable time lags and data-driven model parameters simultaneously. The methodology also involves the orthogonal design and range analysis for extracting the influence of an individual river from that of all the rivers. The integrated methodology is applied to the second largest freshwater lake in China, the Dongting Lake. The results show that: (1) the antecedent lake levels are of crucial importance for the current lake level prediction; (2) the selected river discharge time lags reflect the spatial heterogeneity of the rivers' impacts on lake level changes; (3) the predicted lake levels are in very good agreement with the observed data (RMSE <= 0.091 m; R-2 >= 0.9986). This study demonstrates the practical potential of the integrated methodology, which can provide both the lake level responses to future dam releases and the relative contributions of different rivers to lake level changes.

TI Fluoride and phosphate release from carbonate-rich fluorapatite during

AB Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is increasingly used as a water management tool to enhance water availability and to improve water quality. Until now, however, the risk of fluoride release during MAR with low ionic strength injectate has not been recognised or examined. In this study we analyse and report the mobilisation of fluoride (up to 58 mu M and filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) (up to 55 mu M) during a field groundwater replenishment experiment in which highly treated, deionised wastewater (average TDS 33 mg/L) was injected into a siliciclastic Cretaceous aquifer. In the field experiment, maximum concentrations, which coincided with a rise in pH, exceeded background groundwater concentrations by an average factor of 3.6 for fluoride and 24 for FRP. The combined results from the field experiment, a detailed mineralogical characterisation and geochemical modelling suggested carbonate-rich fluorapatite (CFA: Ca-10(PO4)(5)(CO3,F)F-2) to be the most likely source of fluoride and phosphate release. An anoxic batch experiment with powdered CFA-rich nodules sourced from the target aquifer and aqueous solutions of successively decreasing ionic strength closely replicated the field-observed fluoride and phosphate behaviour. Based on the laboratory experiment and geochemical modelling, we hypothesise that the release of fluoride and phosphate results from the incongruent dissolution of CFA and the simultaneous formation of a depleted layer that has hydrated di-basic calcium phosphate (CaHPO4 & MIDDOT;nH(2)O) composition at the CFA-water interface. Disequilibrium caused by calcium removal following breakthrough of the deionised injectate triggered the release of fluoride and phosphate. Given the increasing use of highly treated, deionised water for MAR and the ubiquitous presence of CFA and fluorapatite (Ca-10(PO4)(6)F-2) in aquifer settings worldwide, the risk of fluoride and phosphate release needs to be considered in the MAR design process.

AB Rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems are an effective low impact development practice that provides both water supply and runoff reduction benefits. A stochastic modelling approach is proposed in this paper to quantify the water supply reliability and stormwater capture efficiency of RWH systems. The input rainfall series is represented as a marked Poisson process and two typical water use patterns are analytically described. The stochastic mass balance equation is solved analytically, and based on this, explicit expressions relating system performance to system characteristics are derived. The performances of a wide variety of RWH systems located in five representative climatic regions of the United States are examined using the newly derived analytical equations. Close agreements between analytical and continuous simulation results are shown for all the compared cases. In addition, an analytical equation is obtained expressing the required storage size as a function of the desired water supply reliability, average water use rate, as well as rainfall and catchment characteristics. The equations developed herein constitute a convenient and effective tool for sizing RWH systems and evaluating their performances.

AB A geological repository for low and intermediate radioactive waste (bottom at -130 m a.s.l.) was constructed from 2008 to 2014 in the southeastern coastal area in Korea. This research aimed to evaluate the hydro geochemistry in this area during the construction period and to determine the characteristics that should be monitored during the operational period. During construction, the groundwater level decreased up to 136 m and the upper groundwater flow in the southeastern area reversed. After the groundwater level dropped below the sea level, the electrical conductivity (EC) in several wells along the coastal line started to increase; 23.2% of the measured water was classified as brackish water and the highest EC observed in groundwater was 18.9 mS/cm, nearly 38% of EC in seawater. The response time of the groundwater chemistry differs depending on the depth, even in wells, because of fracture networks. Among locations that showed drastic changes in EC, only the shallow depth of GM-4 showed a peak pattern in EC, but other locations showed increasing EC patterns or patterns with initial increase and sustained high till the end of the construction period. Based on the Cl/Br ratio, the source of the groundwater salinity was seawater intrusion, and ion exchange played an important role. Compared to Cl concentration, sodium was depleted and calcium was in excess in brackish water; however, the SO4/Cl ratio remained constant at a level similar to seawater. Ca and Fe concentrations showed distinguishable characteristics depending on the location, suggesting differences in geological media. During the operational period, periodical evaluation of the groundwater chemistry in the mixing zone and continuous monitoring of EC patterns and seawater fractions are required.

AB To simulate the impacts of within-storm rainfall variabilities on fast hydrological processes, long precipitation time series with high temporal resolution are required. Due to limited availability of observed data such time series are typically obtained from stochastic models. However, most existing rainfall models are limited in their ability to conserve rainfall event statistics which are relevant for hydrological processes. Poisson rectangular pulse models are widely applied to generate long time series of alternating precipitation events durations and mean intensities as well as interstorm period durations. Multiplicative microcanonical random cascade (MRC) models are used to disaggregate precipitation time series from coarse to fine temporal resolution.
   To overcome the inconsistencies between the temporal structure of the Poisson rectangular pulse model and the MRC model, we developed a new coupling approach by introducing two modifications to the MRC model. These modifications comprise (a) a modified cascade model ("constrained cascade") which preserves the event durations generated by the Poisson rectangular model by constraining the first and last interval of a precipitation event to contain precipitation and (b) continuous sigmoid functions of the multiplicative weights to consider the scale-dependency in the disaggregation of precipitation events of different durations.
   The constrained cascade model was evaluated in its ability to disaggregate observed precipitation events in comparison to existing MRC models. For that, we used a 20-year record of hourly precipitation at six stations across Germany. The constrained cascade model showed a pronounced better agreement with the observed data in terms of both the temporal pattern of the precipitation time series (e.g. the dry and wet spell durations and autocorrelations) and event characteristics (e.g. intra-event intermittency and intensity fluctuation within events). The constrained cascade model also slightly outperformed the other MRC models with respect to the intensity-frequency relationship.
   To assess the performance of the coupled Poisson rectangular pulse and constrained cascade model, precipitation events were stochastically generated by the Poisson rectangular pulse model and then disaggregated by the constrained cascade model. We found that the coupled model performs satisfactorily in terms of the temporal pattern of the precipitation time series, event characteristics and the intensity-frequency relationship.

AB Looking only at climate change impacts provides partial information about a changing hydrologic regime. Understanding the spatio-temporal nature of change in hydrologic processes, and the explicit contributions from both climate and land use drivers, holds more practical value for water resources management and policy intervention. This study presents a comprehensive assessment on the spatio-temporal trend of Blue Water (BW) and Green Water (GW) in a 490,000 km(2) temperate mid-latitude basin (Ohio River Basin) over the past 80 years (1935-2014), and from thereon, quantifies the combined as well as relative contributions of climate and land use changes. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is adopted to simulate hydrologic fluxes. Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen statistical tests are performed on the modeled outputs to detect respectively the trend and magnitude of changes at three different spatial scales the entire basin, regional level, and sub-basin level. Despite the overall volumetric increase of both BW and GW in the entire basin, changes in their annual average values during the period of simulation reveal a distinctive spatial pattern. GW has increased significantly in the upper and lower parts of the basin, which can be related to the prominent land use change in those areas. BW has increased significantly only in the lower part, likely being associated with the notable precipitation change there. Furthermore, the simulation under a time-varying climate but constant land use scenario identifies climate change in the Ohio River Basin to be influential on BW, while the impact is relatively nominal on GW; whereas, land use change increases GW remarkably, but is counterproductive on BW. The approach to quantify combined/relative effects of climate and land use change as shown in this study can be replicated to understand BW-GW dynamics in similar large basins around the globe.

AB In this paper, a comprehensive and interdisciplinary framework for management of eutrophication in off-stream artificial lakes in semi-arid and arid regions is proposed. Identification of the lake's water resources system components and stakeholders, simulation of Phosphorus (P) export from upstream watershed, simulation of the lake water quality as well as simulation of water demands and supply, development of management scenarios for the lake and selecting the best scenario using social choice methods (i.e. discrete and fuzzy Borda counts) are the four main parts of the framework. The proposed framework is applied on Chitgar Artificial Lake (ChAL), the largest intra-urban artificial lake in Tehran which has been constructed in 2010-2013 for recreational purposes. The Load Apportionment Model (LAM) is used for the simulation of P loads from the point and non-point (diffusive) sources and the LakeMab model is used for the simulation of P dynamics in the lake. The management scenarios contain optimized rule curves for water intake/outtake blended with P management plans (i.e. removal of point sources of P load in the upstream watershed, construction of a hydroponic bio-filter or an advanced water treatment plant beside the lake for reduction of external loading of P and recycling lake water, alum treatment of lake sediments for controlling the internal loading of P as well as construction of a dry detention basin). The most preferred scenarios selected by the discrete Borda count are the low-cost alum treatment and dry detention basin, while the most preferred scenario according to fuzzy Borda count, which considers the uncertainty of model inputs, is the costly water treatment plant. In all preferred scenarios, water intake is conducted from flood flows in order to avoid conflict with downstream agricultural demands. In addition to decentralized decision making and stakeholders' participation, the proposed framework promotes the integration of the technical aspects such as the role of internal loading in lake eutrophication and separation of flood and non-flood flows in the off-stream lakes' systems.

AB The present paper proposes a smoothing analysis of hydraulic head data sets obtained by means of different slug tests introduced in a confined aquifer. Laboratory experiments were performed through a 3D large-scale physical model built at the University of Calabria. The hydraulic head data were obtained by a pressure transducer placed in the injection well and subjected to a processing operation to smooth out the high-frequency noise occurring in the recorded signals. The adopted smoothing techniques working in time, frequency and time-frequency domain are the Savitzky-Golay filter modeled by third-order polynomial, the Fourier Transform and two types of Wavelet Transform (Mexican hat and Monet). The performances of the filtered time series of the hydraulic heads for different slug volumes and measurement frequencies were statistically analyzed in terms of optimal fitting of the classical Cooper's equation. For practical purposes, the hydraulic heads smoothed by the involved techniques were used to determine the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer. The energy contents and the frequency oscillations of the hydraulic head variations in the aquifer were exploited in the time-frequency domain by means of Wavelet Transform as well as the non-linear features of the observed hydraulic head oscillations around the theoretical Cooper's equation.

AB Real-time flood forecasting is important for decision-making with regards to flood control and disaster reduction. The conventional approach involves a postprocessor calibration strategy that first calibrates the hydrological model and then estimates errors. This procedure can simulate streamflow consistent with observations, but obtained parameters are not optimal. Joint calibration strategies address this issue by refining hydrological model parameters jointly with the autoregressive (AR) model. In this study, five alternative schemes are used to forecast floods. Scheme I uses only the hydrological model, while scheme II includes an AR model for error correction. In scheme III, differencing is used to remove non-stationarity in the error series. A joint inference strategy employed in scheme IV calibrates the hydrological and AR models simultaneously. The back-fitting algorithm, a basic approach for training an additive model, is adopted in scheme V to alternately recalibrate hydrological and AR model parameters. The performance of the five schemes is compared with a case study of 15 recorded flood events from China's Baiyunshan reservoir basin. Our results show that (1) schemes IV and V outperform scheme III during the calibration and validation periods and (2) scheme V is inferior to scheme IV in the calibration period, but provides better results in the validation period. Joint calibration strategies can therefore improve the accuracy of flood forecasting. Additionally, the back-fitting recalibration strategy produces weaker overcorrection and a more robust performance compared with the joint inference strategy.

AB River monitoring is a critical issue for hydrological modelling that relies strongly on the use of flow rating curves (FRCs). In most cases, these functions are derived by least-squares fitting which usually leads to good performance indices, even when based on a limited range of data that especially lack high flow observations. In this context, cross-section geometry is a controlling factor which is not fully exploited in classical approaches. In fact, river discharge is obtained as the product of two factors: 1) the area of the wetted cross-section and 2) the cross sectionally averaged velocity. Both factors can be expressed as a function of the river stage, defining a viable alternative in the derivation of FRCs. This makes it possible to exploit information about cross-section geometry limiting, at least partially, the uncertainty in the extrapolation of discharge at higher flow values. Numerical analyses and field data confirm the reliability of the proposed procedure for the derivation of FRCs.

AB Evaporation plays a major role in lake systems, as it affects the water, energy and solutes budgets. Water salinity reduces evaporation, and as a result affects the energy budget of the lake, including stored heat. In this study, we explore the seasonal and diurnal variations of evaporation and other energy fluxes over the Dead Sea, the deepest and saltiest hypersaline lake on Earth. We present two consecutive years observations using Eddy Covariance system, meteorological stations and a buoy station measuring the water column properties. These observations reveal the effects of synoptic and mesoscale atmospheric circulation on lake evaporation. The seasonal cycle of evaporation is characterized by two peaks. The summer evaporation peak is related to high radiation inputs. The winter peak stem from the high heat storage of the deep lake, with evaporation driven by high vapor pressure demand, combined with synoptic scale wind systems and thermal instability. In summer, the synoptic circulation is stable, providing a weak background wind velocity (Persian trough), hence, the dominant diurnal wind pattern is induced by the Mediterranean Sea Breeze (mesoscale circulation). The two years of eddy covariance measurements in the hypersaline Dead Sea, located in a hyperarid region, revealed annual evaporation rate of 1.13 +/- 0.13 m yr(-1). We explored several evaporation models versus the directly measured evaporation, and found that the most reliable is a mass transfer model, that was calibrated here for the Dead Sea.

AB For a highly developed urban area with complete drainage systems, flood simulation is necessary for describing the flow dynamics from rainfall, to surface runoff, and to sewer flow. In this study, a coupled flood model based on diffusion wave equations was proposed to simulate one-dimensional sewer flow and two-dimensional overland flow simultaneously. The overland flow model provides details on the rainfall-runoff process to estimate the excess runoff that enters the sewer system through street inlets for sewer flow routing. Three types of inlet modelling are considered in this study, including the manhole-based approach that ignores the street inlets by draining surface water directly into manholes, the inlet-manhole approach that drains surface water into manholes that are each connected to multiple inlets, and the inlet-node approach that drains surface water into sewer nodes that are connected to individual inlets. The simulation results were compared with a high-intensity rainstorm event that occurred in 2015 in Taipei City. In the verification of the maximum flood extent, the two approaches that considered street inlets performed considerably better than that without street inlets. When considering the aforementioned models in terms of temporal flood variation, using manholes as receivers leads to an overall inefficient draining of the surface water either by the manhole-based approach or by the inlet manhole approach. Using the inlet-node approach is more reasonable than using the inlet-manhole approach because the inlet-node approach greatly reduces the fluctuation of the sewer water level. The inlet-node approach is more efficient in draining surface water by reducing flood volume by 13% compared with the inlet manhole approach and by 41% compared with the manhole-based approach. The results show that inlet modeling has a strong influence on drainage efficiency in coupled flood simulation.

AB Selection of suitable urban stormwater harvesting sites and associated project planning are often complex due to spatial, temporal, economic, environmental and social factors, and related various other variables. This paper is aimed at developing a comprehensive methodology framework for evaluating of stormwater harvesting sites in urban areas using Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). At the first phase, framework selects potential stormwater harvesting (SWH) sites using spatial characteristics in a GIS environment. In second phase, MCDA methodology is used for evaluating and ranking of SWH sites in multi-objective and multi-stakeholder environment.
   The paper briefly describes first phase of framework and focuses chiefly on the second phase of framework. The application of the methodology is also demonstrated over a case study comprising of the local government area, City of Melbourne (CoM), Australia for the benefit of wider water professionals engaged in this area. Nine performance measures (PMs) were identified to characterise the objectives and system performance related to the eight alternative SWH sites for the demonstration of the application of developed methodology. To reflect the stakeholder interests in the current study, four stakeholder participant groups were identified, namely, water authorities (WA), academics (AC), consultants (CS), and councils (CL).
   The decision analysis methodology broadly consisted of deriving PROMETHEE II rankings of eight alternative SWH sites in the CoM case study, under two distinct group decision making scenarios. The major innovation of this work is the development and application of comprehensive methodology framework that assists in the selection of potential sites for SWH, and facilitates the ranking in multi-objective and multi-stakeholder environment. It is expected that the proposed methodology will assist the water professionals and managers with better knowledge that will reduce the subjectivity in the selection and evaluation of SWH sites.

TI Estimating actual and potential bare soil evaporation from silty

AB The estimation of evaporative fluxes and their effects on soil suction is assuming a prominent role in the field of interpretation and early-warning prediction of rainfall-induced landslides. Evaporation models refer essentially to sands or plastic (silty and clayey) soils. Models validated specifically for non-plastic silty pyroclastic soils, usually characterized by very high porosity, are instead unavailable. This deficit arises although silty pyroclastic covers are widely spread across the world, increasingly involved in rainfall-induced landslides and recognized showing particular hydrological behaviour. A number of questions may be raised about the issue: (i) may any evaporative models be reliably extended to silty pyroclastic soils?; (ii) what atmospheric variables need to be monitored at least to reliably predict evaporation fluxes in these soils?; and (iii) how accurate evaporation estimations are if they are referred to silty pyroclastic covers for early warning purposes? This study addresses these questions by assessing the capabilities of several simplified models in estimating evaporative (potential and actual) fluxes for silty pyroclastic soils. To this aim, a large-scale lysimeter, consisting in a silty pyroclastic layer exposed to the atmosphere and comprehensively monitored for both weather forcing and hydrological soil variables, is adopted. It provides a dataset of observations suitable to calibrate and validate the selected evaporation models. Moreover, the availability of weather observations makes it possible to define the minimum set of equipment required to attain reliable evaporation estimation. This study shows that: (i) the adoption of a literature-based calibration can produce misleading estimates of actual evaporation, whereas the model performances after a lysimeter-based recalibration are satisfactory; (ii) reducing the weather measurements can induce an overestimation of predicted fluxes up to 50%; and (iii) the investigated models quite accurately predict water out-coming fluxes while running in early warning predictions.

AB Variability in micrometeorological conditions and their influence on estimated reference evapotranspiration (RET) rates were evaluated across a heterogeneous urban environment. Micrometeorological data sets (incoming solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed) were collected over a one-year period at six weather stations in New York City, NY (USA). Weather stations are located at four new urban green space monitoring sites and two airports. Reference evapotranspiration (RET) rates were estimated from the micro meteorological data sets for a short reference surface at a daily time-step using the ASCE Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration Equation, a Penman-Monteith based combination equation. Non-parametric comparative statistical analyses (Kruskal-Wallis) revealed statistically significant differences (at significance level alpha = 0.05) in micrometeorological conditions and estimated RET rates between the six sites. On a cumulative annual basis, estimated RET varied by up to 40 percent between the sites. A new technique for adjusting weather data collected at one location (e.g. regional airports) for use at another location (e.g. interior engineered urban green spaces) was evaluated. The study highlights the importance, for accurate estimation of ET, of onsite micro meteorological data sets, but concludes that additional research is needed to more thoroughly characterize micrometeorological variability across heterogeneous urban environments, and also to evaluate the influence of non-meteorological determinants, e.g. vegetation type, soil/media type, media moisture conditions and anthropogenic heat fluxes, on urban ET.

AB Two dimensional flood inundation models capable of simulating complex spatially and temporally differentiated floodplain flows are routinely used to model and predict flooding. However, advances in modelling techniques have not been matched by improvements in model validation. Validation of flood models remains challenging due to a lack of available spatially-explicit data; traditionally measured data and validation approaches reveal little about the ability of a model to simulate the complex dynamics of floodplain flows, including the pathways, timeline, and impacts of an event. In this paper we propose a novel method for the validation of hydraulic models of flooding using quantitative and qualitative Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI). This method uses VGI data to enhance traditionally measured validation data by reconstructing the observed dynamics of a flood, allowing validation of the temporal and spatial simulation of these dynamics. We illustrate the method using a case study from Corbridge in the northeast of England, using VGI collected through participatory research with people affected by severe flooding in 2015. The results of the study demonstrate that VGI data can be used for the effective reconstruction of flood event dynamics. The results also reveal that the proposed validation approach is able to identify underperformance in the model's simulation of event dynamics not evaluated by standard global performance measures. Such a lack of evaluation can have adverse consequences where dynamic model outputs are used locally to influence floodplain management. As a result, we propose a new framework for model validation, adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach to examining event dynamics using a diverse range of data.

AB Thermal infrared (TIR) imaging has been previously applied to survey relatively large thermal footprints in coastal zones, lakes, reservoirs and rivers. In freshwater systems, the buoyancy of relatively warm groundwater during the winter months allows for the surface identification of groundwater discharge or thermal pollution using TIR imaging. However, information regarding the performance of TIR for resolving this warm groundwater upwelling is limited, particularly at fine spatial scales and variable discharge rates. In order to evaluate the suitability of TIR to trace warm groundwater upwelling at the water surface of lakes, ponds and reservoirs (e.g. lacustrine groundwater discharge (LGD) in shallow near-shore zones) we conducted a mesocosm experiment with a TIR camera situated 4 m above the water surface to capture thermal patterns in response to different groundwater discharge rates, weather conditions and the diurnal cycle. A fiber optic distributed temperature sensing system (FO-DTS) installed at 2 cm below the water surface was used to ground-truth spatial patterns observed in TIR images. Results show the impacts of both the diurnal cycle of net radiation and prevailing weather conditions on the accuracy of TIR imaging for resolving warm groundwater discharge. Most reliable results were obtained under overcast weather conditions and during the night. The results of our study provide guidance for those looking to use TIR for conducting thermal tracing of LGD at the surface of freshwater bodies during winter.

AB A new simple and robust solution, based on uniform steady-state flow velocity, is developed for the problem of solute transport in a fracture-matrix system with a finite penetration depth of a radioactive contaminant into the rock matrix. The solution is an extension of Liu et al. (2017) to finite penetration depth and an alternative solution strategy to the problem solved by Sudicky et al. (1982). The solution takes the form of a convolution of two functions. The first function describes the probability density function of the residence time distribution of a conservative solute resulting merely from advection and Fickian dispersion. The second function is actually the impulse response of the fracture-matrix system in the case of a plug flow without any hydrodynamic dispersion. As a result, the effects of Fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion on solute transport are decoupled, and thus the resulting breakthrough curve can be analyzed in terms of those two functions. In addition to this, the derived Peclet numbers of those two functions, based on temporal moments, are also found to be associated with the derived Peclet number of the resulting breakthrough curve. By comparing the Peclet numbers of those two functions, the contribution of Fickian dispersion and matrix diffusion to solute spreading is determined in a straightforward way. This can aid to find out the dominating mechanism on solute transport, and therefore the performance of breakthrough curve can be approximated by only one function in some specific cases.

AB Anthropogenic warming may change precipitation patterns, impacting infrastructure performance and reliability. Future precipitation statistics generated using General Circulation Models (GCM) are, however, often biased and not easily applied to problems such as runoff estimation. Stochastic weather generation is hence used as an alternative to GCMs in hydrology and hydraulic modelling. This paper explores the dependence of fine temporal precipitation characteristics on air pressure and air temperature using historic observations. The goal is to develop, based on the key causes of precipitation, a climatological basis for a stochastic precipitation generator for non-stationary precipitation under climate change conditions. The analysis focuses on precipitation in the urban Northeast United States and utilizes pooled observations from meteorological stations in New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston over 60 years. A negative correlation between hourly Probability of Precipitation (POP) and air pressure is observed. When the historical records are discretized using air Pressure Change Events (PCE), Decreasing Pressure Change Events (DePCEs) had a higher POP and a higher Precipitation Depth (PD) than Increasing Pressure Change Events (InPCEs). Temperature was more strongly associated with PD during DePCEs than InPCEs; this association was more pronounced during high magnitude PCEs and extreme events. The potential for simulating future hourly precipitation by associating historic hourly precipitation patterns with PCE's and monthly temperature is assessed.

The purpose of this scoping review was to examine and map the extent, range, and nature of the published peer-reviewed literature on the adoption, implementation, and outcomes of source water protection programs involving Indigenous populations in Canada and the United States. This review followed a systematic process to identify and evaluate the literature. Searches were conducted in three aggregator databases (Web of Science (TM), ProQuest (R), and GreenFILE (TM)). Two independent reviewers conducted a systematic two-stage screening process using inclusion and exclusion criteria in the software DistillerSR(C). Articles that met inclusion criteria were analyzed using thematic qualitative and descriptive quantitative methods. The findings indicate that: a) there is a lack of peer-reviewed studies focusing on the ecological outcomes of source water protection programs that are inclusive of Indigenous populations in Canada and the United States; b) the depth to which the literature describes Indigenous involvement in source water protection programs is minimal; and c) Indigenous involvement in source water protection programs is generally not reported as substantial. This review provides several recommendations to improve both the peer reviewed literature on the topic and source water protection programs. There is a need to improve reporting in the literature on quantitative program results, the nature of Indigenous involvement in source water protection programs, and Indigenous-inclusive inter-jurisdictional success stories. It is also recommended that source water protection programs recognize Indigenous peoples as more than stakeholders groups, and that future studies pull from innovations in other fields to address complex problems and provide new insights to the field of source water protection. The methodology presented in this paper provides a template for researchers in engineering and environmental fields, such as hydrology, to identify and review published literature in a systematic, transparent, and rigorous manner.

TI Modelling of metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters: A travel time

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID RAINFALL-RUNOFF RESPONSE; PESTICIDE CONCENTRATIONS; DIFFUSE POLLUTION;
   COEFFICIENTS; GERMANY; LOSSES
AB Diffuse agricultural pollution is widely recognized as a significant threat to the quality of water resources. Metaldehyde is a soluble synthetic aldehyde pesticide used globally in agriculture which has caused recent concern due to high observed levels (exceeding the European and UK standards for pesticides in drinking water value of 0.1 mu g/1) in surface waters utilized for potable water supply. This paper describes the development of a new travel time based physically distributed metaldehyde prediction model which aims to describe the short term fluctuations of metaldehyde concentrations in surface waters caused by rainfall runoff events. This will enable water infrastructure operators to consider informed control decisions in order to improve the quality of abstracted surface water. The methodology is developed and trailed within a case study catchment in the UK. The new approach integrates spatially and temporally disaggregated surface runoff generation, routing and build-up/wash-off concepts using a simple structure in a GIS environment to build a metaldehyde concentration prediction model. The use of 1 km(2) resolution radar rainfall data and identification of high risk areas in the catchment provide an approach which considers the spatio-temporal variations of pollutant generation and transport in the catchment. The model is calibrated and validated using available catchment flow and a new metaldehyde concentration dataset acquired using automatic samplers over four rainfall events. An average coefficient of determination and model efficiency of 0.75 and 0.46 respectively have been obtained for the rainfall events used to validate the model. This shows the capability of the model for the intended purpose of predicting the arrival of peak metaldehyde concentrations at surface water abstraction sites and informing abstraction decisions.

AB Lake Tisso is the fourth largest lake in Denmark with sufficient, continuous surface water input making lake bank filtration an optimal surface water extraction method provided that there are suitable shallow aquifers with a good hydraulic connection to the lake. The shallow subsurface under the lake was mapped by five waterborne Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) and eight Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) surveys to locate potentially suitable aquifers. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) was used for the general characterisation of the hydraulic connection between the lake and aquifer. The waterborne ERT surveys showed several zones of coarser material along the shore extending up to five meters depth below the lake surface, while on-land ERT surveys confirmed that these zones extend to the lakeshore with similar thickness. Both waterborne ERT and GPR profiles agreed that at a selected field site the highest possibility of coarse sediments is 60-140 m from the lakeshore. Lakebed temperatures measured in December 2016, May and June 2017 all indicated potential groundwater discharge to the lake at approximately 135 m from the shoreline supporting the results of geophysical surveys showing coarser sediments in that area. A 2D numerical flow model of the area with a geological setup based on geophysical information and slugtest data, also showed upward groundwater discharge peaks at 60 and 140 m from the shoreline confirming the findings of the field surveys. Thus, this study shows that the combination of waterborne ERT and GPR surveys with DTS measurements is a fast and efficient way to assess the feasibility of lake bank filtration in these settings. This approach of combined hydrogeophysical methods is robust and has a potential to site lake bank filtration areas not only next to large rivers where coarse sediments are found in abundance, but even in different sedimentary environments where suitable layers for lake bank filtration are more difficult to identify.

TI Meteoric water lines in arid Central Asia using event-based and monthly

AB The local meteoric water line (LMWL) reflects the relationship between stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes in precipitation, and is usually calculated using an ordinary least squares regression (OLSR). When event-based data are used to calculate a LMWL, the differences in precipitation amount of samples are not considered using OLSR, which in turn may influence the representativeness of the LMWL for local hydrology. Small rain events occur widely in arid Central Asia (annual mean precipitation < 150 mm), and where smaller precipitation has lower deuterium excess, this results in LMWLs with slopes and intercepts lower than the global average. Based on an observation network of isotopes in precipitation across the Tianshan Mountains in arid Central Asia, LMWLs for 23 stations are calculated from event-based data from 2012 to 2013 (n = 978), using ordinary least squares, reduced major axis and major axis regressions and their precipitation-weighted counterparts. For the northern slope and mountainous areas, the LMWL slope and intercept are close to the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL), but the slope and intercept are lower for the southern slope indicating the greater dominance of sub-cloud evaporation. The effect of moisture recycling in the irrigated areas on the northern slope also can be seen where the LMWL slopes are > 8. Using a precipitation weighted regression method with event-based data (especially precipitation-weighted reduced major axis regression, PWRMA) is generally consistent with the OLSR regression using monthly data. However, event-based datasets provide a wider range of values to better constrain the regression than can be achieved using monthly data over a short period, providing a sounder basis for determining LMWLs for relatively short-term sampling campaigns in an arid setting. The use of the PWRMA regression is preferred for determining the LMWL for the Tianshan Mountains, and results in a regional meteoric water line of delta D = 7.9 delta O-l8 + 10.16.

AB Hydro-diplomacy conversations have up till now been generally state- and basin-centric, focused on formal international relations and transboundary rivers. This paper applies the notion of water diplomacy to a project in rural Southwest Morocco in order to interrogate the scalar potential of water-based environmental peace-building.
   In the Ait Baamrane region of the Anti-Atlas Mountains, a local non-profit oversees the world's largest operational fog-harvesting system, piping potable water collected from the mountains' extensive fog cover to 13 Amazigh villages. Dar Si Hmad's related Ethnographic Field School leverages the fog project's uniqueness to attract scholars to an underrepresented region, where research programming questions mainstream narratives of Morocco and sustainable development while exploring how traditional knowledges can be integrated in scientific innovation.
   This paper argues that, by intentionally using fog to facilitate collaborative exchange, Dar Si Hmad is engaging in a form of hydro-diplomacy. Drawing from ethnographic data and building on international relations theories of Track Diplomacy, this paper demonstrates how fog water is being used to lay the groundwork for durable peace, intercultural understanding, and symbiotic growth. Such local iterations of hydro-diplomacy should be better understood and integrated with the emerging literature on state-to-state water cooperation in order to develop holistic expertise, share best practices, and promote positive policy interventions.

AB In this study, a new approach is developed to simulate groundwater flow through both an overlying unconfined aquifer and an underlying discrete fracture network. The groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network, including magnitude and direction, is explicitly simulated based on the mass conservation, which depends on a variety of parameters related to flow and network characteristics. In the overlying unconfined aquifer, we approximate the flow using the Dupuit assumptions. In the underlying fracture network, we use the cubic law and Forchheimer's law to iteratively simulate laminar or turbulent flow in individual fractures depending on the Reynolds number. Explicitly separating laminar and turbulent flows in the fractures results in a system of nonlinear equations, which is iteratively solved. While the flow from the overlying unconfined aquifer is a small portion of the overall flow in the underlying fracture network, incorrect use of the laminar or turbulent flow equation in the fractures can lead to significant errors in simulating the flow exchange. As apertures increase, both the portion of the total flowrate in the aquifer and the portion of the flow in the fractures coming from the aquifer decrease. As the overall hydraulic gradient increases, both the portion of the total flow in the aquifer and the portion of the fracture flow that comes from the aquifer increase. The portion of the total flow in the aquifer increases with the aquifer thickness, while the portion of fracture flow coming from the overlying aquifer decreases.

AB The hydro-geological properties of streambed together with the hydraulic gradients determine the fluxes of water, energy and solutes between the stream and underlying aquifer system. Dam induced sedimentation affects hyporheic processes and alters substrate pore space geometries in the course of progressive stabilization of the sediment layers. Uncertainty in stream-aquifer interactions arises from the inherent complex-nested flow paths and spatio-temporal variability of streambed hydraulic properties. A detailed field investigation of streambed hydraulic conductivity (K-s) using Guelph Permeameter was carried out in an intermittent stream reach of the Pavanje river basin located in the mountainous, forested tract of western ghats of India. The present study reports the spatial and temporal variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity along the stream reach obstructed by two Vented Dams in sequence. Statistical tests such as Levene's and Welch's t-tests were employed to check for various variability measures. The strength of spatial dependence and the presence of spatial auto-correlation among the streambed K-s samples were tested by using Moran's I statistic. The measures of central tendency and dispersion pointed out reasonable spatial variability in K-s distribution throughout the study reach during two consecutive years 2016 and 2017. The streambed was heterogeneous with regard to hydraulic conductivity distribution with high-K-s zones near the backwater areas of the vented dam and low-K-s zones particularly at the tail water section of vented dams. Dam operational strategies were responsible for seasonal fluctuations in sedimentation and modifications to streambed substrate characteristics (such as porosity, grain size, packing etc.), resulting in heterogeneous streambed K-s profiles. The channel downstream of vented dams contained significantly more cohesive deposits of fine sediment due to the overflow of surplus suspended sediment-laden water at low velocity and pressure head. The statistical test results accept the hypothesis of significant spatial variability of streambed K-s but refuse to accept the temporal variations. The deterministic and geo-statistical approaches of spatial interpolation provided virtuous surface maps of streambed K-s distribution.

AB Extreme flows are key components of river flow regimes that affect manifold hydrological, geomorphological and ecological processes with societal relevance. One fundamental characteristic of extreme flows in river basins is that they exhibit scaling properties which can be identified through scaling (power) laws. Understanding the physical mechanisms behind such scaling laws is a continuing challenge in hydrology, with potential implications for the prediction of river flow regimes in a changing environment and ungauged basins. After highlighting that the scaling properties are sensitive to environmental change, we develop a physical interpretation of how temporal changes in scaling exponents relate to the capacity of river basins to regulate extreme river flows. Regulation is defined here as the basins' capacity to either dampen high flows or to enhance low flows. Further, we use this framework to infer temporal changes in the regulation capacity of five large basins in tropical South America. Our results indicate that, during the last few decades, the Amazon river basin has been reducing its capacity to enhance low flows, likely as a consequence of pronounced environmental change in its south and south-eastern sub-basins. The proposed framework is widely applicable to different basins, and provides foundations for using scaling laws as empirical tools for inferring temporal changes of hydrological regulation, particularly relevant for identifying and managing hydrological consequences of environmental change.

AB Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) plays a fundamental role in agronomic, forestry, and water resources management. Estimating and forecasting ET0 have long been recognized as a major challenge for researchers and practitioners in these communities. This work explored the potential of multiple leading numerical weather predictions (NWPs) for estimating and forecasting summer ET0 at 101 U.S. Regional Climate Reference Network stations over nine climate regions across the contiguous United States (CONUS). Three leading global NWP model forecasts from THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) dataset were used in this study, including the single model ensemble forecasts from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (EC), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System (NCEP), and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office forecasts (MO), as well as multi-model ensemble forecasts from the combinations of these NWP models. A regression calibration was employed to bias correct the ET0 forecasts. Impact of individual forecast variables on ET0 forecasts were also evaluated. The results showed that the EC forecasts provided the least error and highest skill and reliability, followed by the MO and NCEP forecasts. The multi-model ensembles constructed from the combination of EC and MO forecasts provided slightly better performance than the single model EC forecasts. The regression process greatly improved ET0 forecast performances, particularly for the regions involving stations near the coast, or with a complex orography. The performance of EC forecasts was only slightly influenced by the size of the ensemble members, particularly at short lead times. Even with less ensemble members, EC still performed better than the other two NWPs. Errors in the radiation forecasts, followed by those in the wind, had the most detrimental effects on the ET0 forecast performances.

AB Extreme precipitation can cause flooding and may result in great economic losses and deaths. The return level is a commonly used measure of extreme precipitation events and is required for hydrological engineer designs, including those of sewerage systems, dams, reservoirs and bridges. In this paper, we propose a two-step method to estimate the return level and its uncertainty for a study region. In the first step, we use the generalized extreme value distribution, the L-moment method and the stationary bootstrap to estimate the return level and its uncertainty at the site with observations. In the second step, a spatial model incorporating the heterogeneous measurement errors and covariates is trained to estimate return levels at sites with no observations and to improve the estimates at sites with limited information. The proposed method is applied to the daily rainfall data from 273 weather stations in the Haihe river basin of North China. We compare the proposed method with two alternatives: the first one is based on the ordinary Kriging method without measurement error, and the second one smooths the estimated location and scale parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution by the universal Kriging method. Results show that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts. We also propose a novel approach to assess the two-step method by comparing it with the at-site estimation method with a series of reduced length of observations. Estimates of the 2-, 5-, 10-, 20-, 50- and 100-year return level maps and the corresponding uncertainties are provided for the Haihe river basin, and a comparison with those released by the Hydrology Bureau of Ministry of Water Resources of China is made.

AB Green infrastructure such as Low Impact Development (LID) controls are being employed to manage the urban stormwater and restore the predevelopment hydrological conditions besides improving the stormwater runoff water quality. Since runoff generation and infiltration processes are nonlinear, there is a need for identifying optimal combination of LID controls. A coupled optimization-simulation model was developed by linking the U.S. EPA Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) to the Borg Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (Borg MOEA). The coupled model is capable of performing multiobjective optimization which uses SWMM simulations as a tool to evaluate potential solutions to the optimization problem. The optimization-simulation tool was used to evaluate low impact development (LID) stormwater controls. A SWMM model was developed, calibrated, and validated for a sewershed in Windsor, Ontario and LID stormwater controls were tested for three different return periods. LID implementation strategies were optimized using the optimization-simulation model for five different implementation scenarios for each of the three storm events with the objectives of minimizing peak flow in the stormsewers, reducing total runoff, and minimizing cost. For the sewershed in Windsor, Ontario, the peak run off and total volume of the runoff were found to reduce by 13% and 29%, respectively.

TI Using complexity science and negotiation theory to resolve

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

ID IRRIGATION; POLICY
AB Many water governance and management issues are complex. The complexity of these issues is related to crossing of multiple boundaries: political, social and jurisdictional, as well as physical, ecological and biogeochemical. Resolution of these issues usually requires interactions of many parties with conflicting values and interests operating across multiple boundaries and scales to make decisions. The interdependence and feedback among interacting variables, processes, actors and institutions are hard to model and difficult to forecast. Thus, decision-making related to complex water problems needs be contingent and adaptive. This paper draws on a number of ideas from complexity science and negotiation theory that may make it easier to cope with the complexities and difficulties of managing boundary crossing water disputes. It begins with the Water Diplomacy Framework that was developed and tested over the past several years. Then, it uses three key ideas from complexity science (interdependence and interconnectedness; uncertainty and feedback; emergence and adaptation) and three from negotiation theory (stakeholder identification and engagement; joint fact finding; and value creation through option generation) to show how application of these ideas can help enhance effectiveness of water management.

AB Quantitative analysis of recession curves of karst spring hydrographs is a vital tool for understanding karst hydrology and inferring hydraulic properties of karst aquifers. This paper presents a new model for simulating karst spring recession curves. The new model has the following characteristics: (1) the model considers two separate but hydraulically connected reservoirs: matrix reservoir and conduit reservoir; (2) the model separates karst spring hydrograph recession into three stages: conduit-drainage stage, mixed-drainage stage (with both conduit drainage and matrix drainage), and matrix-drainage stage; and (3) in the mixed-drainage stage, the model uses multiple conduit layers to present different levels of conduit development. The new model outperforms the classical Mangin model and the recently developed Fiorillo model for simulating observed discharge at the Madison Blue Spring located in northern Florida. This is attributed to the latter two characteristics of the new model. Based on the new model, a method is developed for estimating effective porosity of the matrix and conduit reservoirs for the three drainage stages. The estimated porosity values are consistent with measured matrix porosity at the study site and with estimated conduit porosity reported in literature. The new model for simulating karst spring hydrograph recession is mathematically general, and can be applied to a wide range of karst spring hydrographs to understand groundwater flow in karst aquifers. The limitations of the model are discussed at the end of this paper.

AB This paper examines the frequency, distribution tails, and peak-over-threshold (POT) of extreme floods through analysis that centers on the October 2015 flooding in North Carolina (NC) and South Carolina (SC), United States (US). The most striking features of the October 2015 flooding were a short time to peak (T-p) and a multi-hour continuous flood peak which caused intensive and widespread damages to human lives, properties, and infrastructure. The 2015 flooding was produced by a sequence of intense rainfall events which originated from category 4 hurricane Joaquin over a period of four days. Here, the probability distribution and distribution parameters (i.e., location, scale, and shape) of floods were investigated by comparing the upper part of empirical distributions of the annual maximum flood (AMF) and POT with light- to heavy- theoretical tails: Frechet, Pareto, Gumbel, Weibull, Beta, and Exponential. Specifically, four sets of U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) gauging data from the central Carolinas with record lengths from approximately 65-125 years were used. Analysis suggests that heavier-tailed distributions are in better agreement with the POT and somewhat AMF data than more often used exponential (light) tailed probability distributions. Further, the threshold selection and record length affect the heaviness of the tail and fluctuations of the parent distributions. The shape parameter and its evolution in the period of record play a critical and poorly understood role in determining the scaling of flood response to intense rainfall.

AB Geostatistical analysis has been introduced over half a century ago to allow quantifying seemingly random spatial variations in earth quantities such as rock mineral content or permeability. The traditional approach has been to view such quantities as multivariate Gaussian random functions characterized by one or a few well-defined spatial correlation scales. There is, however, mounting evidence that many spatially varying quantities exhibit non-Gaussian behavior over a multiplicity of scales. The purpose of this minireview is not to paint a broad picture of the subject and its treatment in the literature. Instead, we focus on very recent advances in the recognition and analysis of this ubiquitous phenomenon, which transcends hydrology and the Earth sciences, brought about largely by our own work. In particular, we use porosity data from a deep borehole to illustrate typical aspects of such scalable non-Gaussian behavior, describe a very recent theoretical model that (for the first time) captures all these behavioral aspects in a comprehensive manner, show how this allows generating random realizations of the quantity conditional on sampled values, point toward ways of incorporating scalable non Gaussian behavior in hydrologic analysis, highlight the significance of doing so, and list open questions requiring further research.

AB Clean water is crucial for sustainable economic and social development; however, around the world low water use efficiency and increasing water pollution have become serious problems. To comprehensively evaluate water use and wastewater treatment, this paper integrated bi-level programming (BLP) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with a feedback variable to deal with poor output to rank DMUs using a super efficiency DEA. The proposed model was applied to a case study of 10 cities in the Minjiang River Basin to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness, from which it was found that a water system can only be cost-efficient when both the water use and wastewater treatment subsystems are both cost-efficient. The comparison analysis demonstrated that the proposed model was more discriminating, and stable than traditional DEA models and was able to better improve total water system cost efficiencies than a BLP-DEA model.

TI Computing under-ice discharge: A proof-of-concept using hydroacoustics
   and the Probability Concept

AB Under-ice discharge is estimated using open-water reference hydrographs; however, the ratings for ice-affected sites are generally qualified as poor. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with the Colorado Water Conservation Board, conducted a proof-of-concept to develop an alternative method for computing under-ice discharge using hydroacoustics and the Probability Concept.
   The study site was located south of Minturn, Colorado (CO), USA, and was selected because of (1) its proximity to the existing USGS streamgage 09064600 Eagle River near Minturn, CO, and (2) its ease-of-access to verify discharge using a variety of conventional methods. From late September 2014 to early March 2015, hydraulic conditions varied from open water to under ice. These temporal changes led to variations in water depth and velocity. Hydroacoustics (tethered and uplooking acoustic Doppler current profilers and acoustic Doppler velocimeters) were deployed to measure the vertical-velocity profile at a singularly important vertical of the channel-cross section. Because the velocity profile was non-standard and cannot be characterized using a Power Law or Log Law, velocity data were analyzed using the Probability Concept, which is a probabilistic formulation of the velocity distribution. The Probability Concept-derived discharge was compared to conventional methods including stage-discharge and index-velocity ratings and concurrent field measurements; each is complicated by the dynamics of ice formation, pressure influences on stage measurements, and variations in cross-sectional area due to ice formation.
   No particular discharge method was assigned as truth. Rather one statistical metric (Kolmogorov-Smirnov; KS), agreement plots, and concurrent measurements provided a measure of comparability between various methods. Regardless of the method employed, comparisons between each method revealed encouraging results depending on the flow conditions and the absence or presence of ice cover.
   For example, during lower discharges dominated by under-ice and transition (intermittent open-water and under-ice) conditions, the KS metric suggests there is not sufficient information to reject the null hypothesis and implies that the Probability Concept and index-velocity rating represent similar distributions. During high-flow, open-water conditions, the comparisons are less definitive; therefore, it is important that the appropriate analytical method and instrumentation be selected. Six conventional discharge measurements were collected concurrently with Probability Concept-derived discharges with percent differences (%) of -9.0%, -21%, -8.6%, 17.8%, 3.6%, and -2.3%.
   This proof-of-concept demonstrates that riverine discharges can be computed using the Probability Concept for a range of hydraulic extremes (variations in discharge, open-water and under-ice conditions) immediately after the siting phase is complete, which typically requires one day. Computing real-time discharges is particularly important at sites, where (1) new streamgages are planned, (2) river hydraulics are complex, and (3) shifts in the stage-discharge rating are needed to correct the streamflow record. Use of the Probability Concept does not preclude the need to maintain a stage-area relation. Both the Probability Concept and index-velocity rating offer water-resource managers and decision makers alternatives for computing real-time discharge for open-water and under-ice conditions.

ID JEJU ISLAND; NUMERICAL INVERSION; RECHARGE; INFILTRATION
AB A generalized water table fluctuation model based on precipitation was developed using a statistical conceptualization of unsaturated infiltration fluxes. A gamma distribution function was adopted as a transfer function due to its versatility in representing recharge rates with temporally dispersed infiltration fluxes, and a Laplace transformation was used to obtain an analytical solution. To prove the general applicability of the model, convergences with previous water table fluctuation models were shown as special cases. For validation, a few hypothetical cases were developed, where the applicability of the model to a wide range of unsaturated zone conditions was confirmed. For further validation, the model was applied to water table level estimations of three monitoring wells with considerably thick unsaturated zones on Jeju Island. The results show that the developed model represented the pattern of hydrographs from the two monitoring wells fairly well. The lag times from precipitation to recharge estimated from the developed system transfer function were found to agree with those from a conventional cross-correlation analysis. The developed model has the potential to be adopted for the hydraulic characterization of both saturated and unsaturated zones by being calibrated to actual data when extraneous and exogenous causes of water table fluctuation are limited. In addition, as it provides reference estimates, the model can be adopted as a tool for surveilling groundwater resources under hydraulically stressed conditions.

AB For forecasting monthly precipitation in an arid region, the feed forward back-propagation, radial basis function and generalized regression artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used in this study. The ANN models are improved after incorporation of a Markov chain-based algorithm (MC-ANNs) with which the percentage of dry months is forecasted perfectly, thus generation of any non-physical negative precipitation is eliminated. Due to the fact that recorded precipitation time series are usually shorter than the length needed for a proper calibration of ANN models, synthetic monthly precipitation data are generated by Thomas-Fiering model to further improve the performance of forecasting. For case studies from Jordan, it is seen that only a slightly better performance is achieved with the use of MC and synthetic data. A conditional statement is, therefore, established and imbedded into the ANN models after the incorporation of MC and support of synthetic data, to substantially improve the ability of the models for forecasting monthly precipitation in arid regions.

AB Complex rainfall situations can generate overland flow with complex hydrodynamic characteristics, affecting the surface configuration (i.e. sheet erosion) and environment to varying degrees. Reliable numerical simulations can provide a scientific method for the optimization of environmental management. A mesoscopic numerical method, the lattice Boltzmann method, was employed to simulate overland flows. To deal with complex rainfall, two schemes were introduced to improve the lattice Boltzmann equation and the local equilibrium function, respectively. Four typical cases with differences in rainfall, bed roughness, and slopes were selected to test the accuracy and applicability of the proposed schemes. It was found that the simulated results were in good agreement with the experimental data, analytical values, and the results produced by other models.

AB Research on water cooperation in the Eastern Nile Basin has focused on expanding policy and diplomacy tools for a better allocation of transboundary water resources confined to the river. Regional cooperation on water and related sectors such as energy and land expands the bargaining and areas for mutual gain, and thus enhances cooperation perspectives. This paper looks at the contribution and the potential benefits of a regional cooperation approach to addressing the underlying challenges of water diplomacy, such as complexity and distrust. It also promotes the understanding of river basins as a "resource basin" of integrated and linked resource-use issues, not always related to the river flow. The paper provides an analysis of priority issues for water- energy-food nexus in regional cooperation in the Eastern Nile Basin. This basin represents an illustrative case for regional cooperation and increased integration due to multiple comparative advantages inherent in the uneven endowments of water, energy and arable land resources, and to varying levels of economic and technological advancement among the three riparian countries: Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia. The paper also analyzes institutional arrangements on a regional scale, and elaborates on the inherent trade-offs associated with them.

AB The long-term change of evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for managing water resources in areas with extreme climates, such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study proposed a modified algorithm for estimating ET based on the MOD16 algorithm on a global scale over alpine meadow on the TP in China. Wind speed and vegetation height were integrated to estimate aerodynamic resistance, while the temperature and moisture constraints for stomatal conductance were revised based on the technique proposed by Fisher et al, (2008). Moreover, Fisher's method for soil evaporation was adopted to reduce the uncertainty in soil evaporation estimation. Five representative alpine meadow sites on the TP were selected to investigate the performance of the modified algorithm. Comparisons were made between the ET observed using the Eddy Covariance (EC) and estimated using both the original and modified algorithms. The results revealed that the modified algorithm performed better than the original MOD16 algorithm with the coefficient of determination (R-2) increasing from 0.26 to 0.68, and root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing from 1.56 to 0.78 mm d(-1). The modified algorithm performed slightly better with a higher R-2 (0.70) and lower RMSE (0.61 mm d(-1)) for after-precipitation days than for non precipitation days at Suli site. Contrarily, better results were obtained for non-precipitation days than for after precipitation days at Arou, Tanggula, and Hulugou sites, indicating that the modified algorithm may be more suitable for estimating ET for non-precipitation days with higher accuracy than for after-precipitation days, which had large observation errors. The comparisons between the modified algorithm and two mainstream methods suggested that the modified algorithm could produce high accuracy ET over the alpine meadow sites on the TP.

AB Source apportionment is critical for guiding development of efficient watershed nitrogen (N) pollution control measures. The ReNuMa (Regional Nutrient Management) model, a semi-empirical, semi-process-oriented model with modest data requirements, has been widely used for riverine N source apportionment. However, the ReNuMa model contains limitations for addressing long-term N dynamics by ignoring temporal changes in atmospheric N deposition rates and N-leaching lag effects. This work modified the ReNuMa model by revising the source code to allow yearly changes in atmospheric N deposition and incorporation of N-leaching lag effects into N transport processes. The appropriate N-leaching lag time was determined from cross-correlation analysis between annual watershed individual N source inputs and riverine N export. Accuracy of the modified ReNuMa model was demonstrated through analysis of a 31-year water quality record (1980-2010) from the Yongan watershed in eastern China. The revisions considerably improved the accuracy (Nash-Sutcliff coefficient increased by similar to 0.2) of the modified ReNuMa model for predicting riverine N loads. The modified model explicitly identified annual and seasonal changes in contributions of various N sources (i.e., point vs. nonpoint source, surface runoff vs. groundwater) to riverine N loads as well as the fate of watershed anthropogenic N inputs. Model results were consistent with previously modeled or observed lag time length as well as changes in riverine chloride and nitrate concentrations during the low-flow regime and available N levels in agricultural soils of this watershed. The modified ReNuMa model is applicable for addressing long-term changes in riverine N sources, providing decision-makers with critical information for guiding watershed N pollution control strategies.

AB Floodplain mapping using hydrodynamic models is difficult in data scarce regions. Additionally, using hydrodynamic models to map floodplain over large stream network can be computationally challenging. Some of these limitations of floodplain mapping using hydrodynamic modeling can be overcome by developing computationally efficient statistical methods to identify floodplains in large and ungauged watersheds using publicly available data. This paper proposes a geomorphic model to generate probabilistic 100-year floodplain maps for the Conterminous United States (CONUS). The proposed model first categorizes the watersheds in the CONUS into three classes based on the height of the water surface corresponding to the 100-year flood from the streambed. Next, the probability that any watershed in the CONUS belongs to one of these three classes is computed through supervised classification using watershed characteristics related to topography, hydrography, land use and climate. The result of this classification is then fed into a probabilistic threshold binary classifier (PTBC) to generate the probabilistic 100-year floodplain maps. The supervised classification algorithm is trained by using the 100-year Flood Insurance Rated Maps (FIRM) from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA FIRMs are also used to validate the performance of the proposed model in areas not included in the training. Additionally, HEC-RAS model generated flood inundation extents are used to validate the model performance at fifteen sites that lack FEMA maps. Validation results show that the probabilistic 100 year floodplain maps, generated by proposed model, match well with both FEMA and HEC-RAS generated maps. On average, the error of predicted flood extents is around 14% across the CONUS. The high accuracy of the validation results shows the reliability of the geomorphic model as an alternative approach for fast and cost effective delineation of 100-year floodplains for the CONUS.

AB Lakes provide enormous economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits to citizens. These ecosystem services may be adversely impacted by climate change. In the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area of Minnesota, USA, many lakes have been at historic low levels and water augmentation strategies have been proposed to alleviate the problem. White Bear Lake (WBL) is a notable example. Its water level declined 1.5 m during 2003-2013 for reasons that are not fully understood. This study examined current, past, and future lake evaporation to better understand how climate will impact the water balance of lakes within this region. Evaporation from WBL was measured from July 2014 to February 2017 using two eddy covariance (EC) systems to provide better constraints on the water budget and to investigate the impact of evaporation on lake level. The estimated annual evaporation losses for years 2014 through 2016 were 559 +/- 22 mm, 779 +/- 81 mm, and 766 +/- 11 mm, respectively. The higher evaporation in 2015 and 2016 was caused by the combined effects of larger average daily evaporation and a longer ice-free season. The EC measurements were used to tune the Community Land Model 4 - Lake, Ice, Snow and Sediment Simulator (CLM4-LISSS) to estimate lake evaporation over the period 1979-2016. Retrospective analyses indicate that WBL evaporation increased during this time by about 3.8 mm year(-1), which was driven by increased wind speed and lake-surface vapor pressure gradient. Using a business-as-usual greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP8.5), lake evaporation was modeled forward in time from 2017 to 2100. Annual evaporation is expected to increase by 1.4 mm year(-1) over this century, largely driven by lengthening ice-free periods. These changes in ice phenology and evaporation will have important implications for the regional water balance, and water management and water augmentation strategies that are being proposed for these Metropolitan lakes.

AB The high solubility and conservative behaviour of chloride make it ideal for use as an environmental tracer of water and salt movement through the hydrologic cycle. For such use the spatial distribution of chloride deposition in rainfall at a suitable scale must be known. A number of authors have used point data acquired from field studies of chloride deposition around Australia to construct relationships to characterise chloride deposition as a function of distance from the coast; these relationships have allowed chloride deposition to be interpolated in different regions around Australia. In this paper we took this a step further and developed a chloride deposition map for all of Australia which includes a quantification of uncertainty. A previously developed four parameter model of chloride deposition as a function of distance from the coast for Australia was used as the basis for producing a continental scale chloride deposition map. Each of the four model parameters were made spatially variable by creating parameter surfaces that were interpolated using a pilot point regularisation approach within a parameter estimation software. The observations of chloride deposition were drawn from a literature review that identified 291 point measurements of chloride deposition over a period of 80 years spread unevenly across all Australian States and Territories. A best estimate chloride deposition map was developed from the resulting surfaces on a 0.05 degree grid. The uncertainty in the chloride deposition map was quantified as the 5th and 95th percentile of 1000 calibrated models produced via Null Space Monte Carlo analysis and the spatial variability of chloride deposition across the continent was consistent with landscape morphology. The temporal variability in chloride deposition on a decadal scale was investigated in the Murray-Darling Basin, this highlighted the need for long-term monitoring of chloride deposition if the uncertainty of the continental scale map is to be reduced. Use of the derived chloride deposition map was demonstrated for a probabilistic estimation of groundwater recharge for the southeast of South Australia using the chloride mass balance method.

AB In this study, a novel surrogate model assisted multiobjective memetic algorithm (SMOMA) is developed for optimal pumping strategies of large-scale coastal groundwater problems. The proposed SMOMA integrates an efficient data-driven surrogate model with an improved non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm-II (NSGAII) that employs a local search operator to accelerate its convergence in optimization. The surrogate model based on Kernel Extreme Learning Machine (KELM) is developed and evaluated as an approximate simulator to generate the patterns of regional groundwater flow and salinity levels in coastal aquifers for reducing huge computational burden. The KELM model is adaptively trained during evolutionary search to satisfy desired fidelity level of surrogate so that it inhibits error accumulation of forecasting and results in correctly converging to true Pareto-optimal front. The proposed methodology is then applied to a large-scale coastal aquifer management in Baldwin County, Alabama. Objectives of minimizing the saltwater mass increase and maximizing the total pumping rate in the coastal aquifers are considered. The optimal solutions achieved by the proposed adaptive surrogate model are compared against those solutions obtained from one-shot surrogate model and original simulation model. The adaptive surrogate model does not only improve the prediction accuracy of Pareto-optimal solutions compared with those by the one-shot surrogate model, but also maintains the equivalent quality of Paretooptimal solutions compared with those by NSGAII coupled with original simulation model, while retaining the advantage of surrogate models in reducing computational burden up to 94% of time-saving. This study shows that the proposed methodology is a computationally efficient and promising tool for multiobjective optimizations of coastal aquifer managements.

AB Managed aquifer recharge (MAR) is a well-known technique for improving water quality and increasing groundwater resources. Denitrification (i.e. removal of nitrate) can be enhanced during MAR by coupling an artificial recharge pond with a permeable reactive layer (PRL). In this study, we examined the suitability of a multi-isotope approach for assessing the long-term effectiveness of enhancing denitrification in a PRL containing vegetal compost. Batch laboratory experiments confirmed that the PRL was still able to enhance denitrification two years after its installation in the infiltration pond. At the field scale, changes in redox indicators along a flow path and below the MAR-PRL system were monitored over 21 months during recharge and non-recharge periods. Results showed that the PRL was still releasing non-purgeable dissolved organic carbon five years after its installation. Nitrate concentration coupled with isotopic data collected from the piezometer network at the MAR system indicated that denitrification was occurring in the saturated zone immediately beneath the infiltration pond, where recharged water and native groundwater mix. Furthermore, longer operational periods of the MAR-PRL system increased denitrification extent. Multi-isotope analyses are therefore proved to be useful tools in identifying and quantifying denitrification in MAR-PRL systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we explored how landscape characteristics such as topography, geology, soils and land cover influence the way catchments respond to changing climate conditions. Based on an ensemble of 15 regional climate models bias-corrected with a distribution-mapping approach, present and future streamflow in 14 neighboring and rather similar catchments in Northern Sweden was simulated with the HBV model. We established functional relationships between a range of landscape characteristics and projected changes in streamflow signatures. These were then used to analyze hydrological consequences of physical perturbations in a hypothetically ungauged basin in a climate change context. Our analysis showed a strong connection between the forest cover extent and the sensitivity of different components of a catchment's hydrological regime to changing climate conditions. This emphasizes the need to redefine forestry goals and practices in advance of climate change-related risks and uncertainties.

AB Microbial contamination of recreational beaches is often at its worst after heavy rainfall events due to storm floods that carry fecal matter and other pollutants from the watershed. Similarly, overflows of untreated sewage from combined sewerage systems may discharge directly into coastal water or via rivers and streams. In order to understand the effect of rainfall events, wind-directions and tides on the recreational water quality, GEMSS, an integrated 3D hydrodynamic model was applied to assess the spreading of Escherichia cob (E. cob) at the Sandvika beaches, located in the Oslo fiord. The model was also used to theoretically investigate the effect of discharges from septic tanks from boats on the water quality at local beaches. The model make use of microbial decay rate as the main input representing the survival of microbial pathogens in the ocean, which vary widely depending on the type of pathogen and environmental stress. The predicted beach water quality was validated against observed data after a heavy rainfall event using Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E) and the overall result indicated that the model performed quite well and the simulation was in - good agreement with the observed E. coil concentrations for all beaches. The result of this study indicated that: 1) the bathing water quality was poor according to the EU bathing water directive up to two days after the heavy rainfall event depending on the location of the beach site. 2) The discharge from a boat at 300-meter distance to the beaches slightly increased the E. coil levels at the beaches. 3) The spreading of microbial pathogens from its source to the different beaches depended on the wind speed and the wind direction.

AB There are serious concerns between forest and water quantity, Chinese extensive land area makes the relationship more complicated, thus, the effects of forest structure on hydrological processes in China were not fully comprehended. In this research, forest's hydrological functions, including rainfall partitioning, litter interception, evapotranspiration (ET), were analyzed in China. The results showed that throughfall was the largest proportion of gross precipitation with fraction between 69.3 +/- 8.8% and 84.4 +/- 5.6%. Then was canopy interception which varied from 14.6 +/- 1.4% to 29.1 +/- 3.3%. Throughfall was correlated with gross precipitation, canopy thickness and canopy density. Canopy interception was correlated with gross precipitation, LAI, canopy density, biomass, mixed degree, uniform angle index, aggregation index. Stemflow accounted for only 1.2 +/- 0.32% of gross precipitation, with the greatest fraction of 2.1 +/- 0.2% in XBH site and the least fraction of 0.3 +/- 0.1% in DB site. Gross precipitation was the main factor in determining stemflow. DB site had the greatest litter interception (7.7 +/- 0.8 mm) and HB site had the least (0.9 +/- 0.3 mm). Litter interception had closer correlation with undecomposed litter mass (0.66) than total litter mass (0.46). Path-coefficient analysis showed that stand density, Shannon-Wiener index, litter mass, size ratio had greater impact on litter interception than other factors. ET was mainly influenced by precipitation, and it also correlated with LAI, canopy density and biomass. In north China, ET percentage (the ratio of ET and precipitation) was 82.7-109.5%, while it decreased to 63.1-88.5% in south China, ET demand in XBS site was larger than precipitation. ET percentage increased with increasing latitude and elevation, decreased with increasing temperature.

AB River deltas sustain important ecosystems with rich biodiversity and large biomass, as well as human populations via the availability of water and food sources. Anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, tourism and agriculture, may pose threats to river deltas. The knowledge of the factors controlling the regional water quality regime in these areas is important for planning sustainable use and management of the water resources. Here, hydrochemical methods and multivariate statistical techniques were combined to investigate the shallow aquifer of the Pinios River (Thessaly) deltaic plain with respect to water quality, hydrogeochemical evolution and interactions between groundwater and surface water bodies.
   Water quality assessment indicated that most of the river and groundwater samples fully comply with the criteria set by the Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC). The river is recharged mainly from springs of the Tempi valley and the shallow aquifer, and to a lesser degree from precipitation, throughout the year. The hydrogeochemical characteristics indicated a cation (Ca, Mg, and Na) bicarbonate water type, which evolves to calcium -chloride, sodium-bicarbonate and sodium-chloride water type, in the northern part of the delta. Calcite and dolomite dissolution determined the major ion chemistry, but other processes, such as silicate weathering and cation exchange reactions, also contributed. In the northern part of the plain, the interaction with the deeper aquifer enriched the shallow aquifer with Na and Cl ions.
   Principal Component Analysis showed that five components (PCs) explain 77% of the total variance of water quality parameters; these are: (1) salinity; (2) water-silicate rocks interaction; (3) hardness due to calcite dissolution, and cation exchange processes; (4) nitrogen pollution; and (5) non-N-related artificial fertilizers. This study demonstrated that the variation of water hydrochemistry in the deltaic plain could be attributed to natural and anthropogenic processes. The interpretation of the PCA results dictated the parameters used for the development of a modified Water Quality Index (WQI), to provide a more comprehensive spatial representation of the water quality of the river delta.

AB A rapid method for in-situ elemental composition analysis of metal-laden water would be indispensable for studying polluted water. Current analytical lab methods to determine water quality include flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS), atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS), electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (EAAS), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectroscopy. However only two field methods, colorimetry and absorptiometry, exist for elemental analysis of water. Portable X-ray fluorescence (PXRF) spectrometry is an effective method for elemental analysis of soil, sediment, and other matrices. However, the accuracy of PXRF is known to be affected while scanning moisture-laden soil samples. This study sought to statistically establish PXRF's predictive ability for various elements in water at different concentrations relative to inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). A total of 390 metal-laden water samples collected from leaching columns of mine tailings in South Africa were analyzed via PXRF and ICP-AES. The PXRF showed differential effectiveness in elemental quantification. For the collected water samples, the best relationships between ICP and PXRF elemental data were obtained for K and Cu (R-2 = 0.92). However, when scanning ICP calibration solutions with elements in isolation, PXRF results indicated near perfect agreement; Ca, K, Fe, Cu and Pb produced an R-2 of 0.99 while Zn and Mn produced an R-2 of 1.00. The utilization of multiple PXRF (stacked) beams produced stronger correlation to ICP relative to the use of a single beam in isolation. The results of this study demonstrated the PXRF's ability to satisfactorily predict the composition of metal-laden water as reported by ICP for several elements. Additionally this study indicated the need for a "Water Mode" calibration for the PXRF and demonstrates the potential of PXRF for future study of polluted or contaminated waters.

AB Stream depletion due to groundwater extraction by wells may cause impact on aquatic ecosystem in streams, conflict over water rights, and contamination of water from irrigation wells near polluted streams. A variety of studies have been devoted to addressing the issue of stream depletion, but a fundamental framework for analytical modeling developed from aquifer viewpoint has not yet been found. This review shows key differences in existing models regarding the stream depletion problem and provides some guidelines for choosing a proper analytical model in solving the problem of concern. We introduce commonly used models composed of flow equations, boundary conditions, well representations and stream treatments for confined, unconfined, and leaky aquifers. They are briefly evaluated and classified according to six categories of aquifer type, flow dimension, aquifer domain, stream representation, stream channel geometry, and well type. Finally, we recommend promising analytical approaches that can solve stream depletion problem in reality with aquifer heterogeneity and irregular geometry of stream channel. Several unsolved stream depletion problems are also recommended.

AB Studying solute dispersion in channel flows is of significance for environmental and industrial applications. Two-dimensional concentration distribution for a most typical case of a point source release on the free water surface in a channel flow with bed absorption is presented by means of Chatwin's long-time asymptotic technique. Five basic characteristics of Taylor dispersion and vertical mean concentration distribution with skewness and kurtosis modifications are also analyzed. The results reveal that bed absorption affects both the longitudinal and vertical concentration distributions and causes the contaminant cloud to concentrate in the upper layer. Additionally, the cross-sectional concentration distribution shows an asymptotic Gaussian distribution at large time which is unaffected by the bed absorption. The vertical concentration distribution is found to be nonuniform even at large time. The obtained results are essential for practical implements with strict environmental standards.

AB Rainfall or snow-melted water recharge easily saturates loose top soils with a less permeable underlayer, such as cultivated soil slope and partially thawed top soil layer, and thus, may influence the velocity of water flow. This study suggested a methodology and device system to supply water from the bottom soil layer at the different locations of slopes. Water seeps into and saturates the soil, when the water level is controlled at the same height of the soil surface. The structures and functions of the device, the components, and the operational principles are described in detail. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted under slope gradients of 5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, and 20 degrees and flow rates of 2, 4, and 8 L min(-1) to measure the water flow velocities over eroding and non-eroded loess soil slopes, under saturated conditions by using electrolyte tracing. Results showed that flow velocities on saturated slopes were 17% to 88% greater than those on non-saturated slopes. Flow velocity increased rapidly under high flow rates and slope gradients. Saturation conditions were suitable in maintaining smooth rill geo-morphology and causing fast water flow. The saturated soil slope had a lubricant effect on the soil surface to reduce the frictional force, resulting in high flow velocity. The flow velocities of eroding rills under different slope gradients and flow rates were approximately 14% to 33% lower than those of non-eroded rills on saturated loess slopes. Compared with that on a saturated loess slope, the eroding rill on a non-saturated loess slope can produce headcuts to reduce the flow velocity. This study helps understand the hydrodynamics of soil erosion and sediment transportation of saturated soil slopes.

TI Runoff sensitivity to climate change in the Nile River Basin
SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Climate change; Nile River Basin; Runoff elasticity; Water resources
AB In data scarce basins, such as the Nile River Basin (NRB) in Africa, constraints related to data availability, quality, and access often complicate attempts to estimate runoff sensitivity using conventional methods. In this paper, we show that by integrating the concept of the aridity index (AI) (derived from the Budyko curve) and climate elasticity, we can obtain the first order response of the runoff sensitivity using minimal data input and modeling expertise or experience. The concept of runoff elasticity relies on the fact that the energy available for evapotranspiration plays a major role in determining whether the precipitation received within a drainage basin generates runoff. The approach does not account for human impacts on runoff modification and or diversions. By making use of freely available gauge-corrected satellite data for precipitation, temperature, runoff, and potential evapotranspiration, we derived the sensitivity indicator (beta) to determine the runoff response to changes in precipitation and temperature for four climatic zones in the NRB, namely, tropical, subtropical, semiarid and arid zones. The proposed sensitivity indicator can be partitioned into different elasticity components i.e: precipitation (epsilon(p)), potential evapotranspiration (epsilon(ETp)), temperature (epsilon(T)) and the total elasticity (epsilon(tot)). These elasticities allow robust quantification of the runoff response to the potential changes in precipitation and temperature with a high degree of accuracy. Results indicate that the tropical zone is energy-constrained with low sensitivity, (beta < 1.0), implying that input precipitation exceeds the amounts that can be evaporated given the available energy. The subtropical zone is subdivided into two distinct regions, the lowland (Machar and Sudd marshes), and the highland area (Blue Nile Basin), where each area has a unique sensitivity. The lowland area has high sensitivity, (beta > 1.0). The subtropical-highland zone moves between energy-limited to water-limited conditions during periods of wet and dry spells with varying sensitivity. The semiarid and arid zones are water limited, with high sensitivity, (beta > 1.0). The calculated runoff elasticities show that a 10% decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in runoff of between 19% in the tropical zone and 30% in the arid zones. On the other hand, a 10% precipitation increase leads to a runoff increase of 14% in the tropical zone and 22% in the arid zone. The estimated runoff changes are consistent with the result obtained using other methods. Thus, the elasticity approach combines data parsimony and analytical simplicity to produce results that are practically useful for most purposes while facilitating communication with stakeholders with different levels of scientific knowledge. More research is needed to extend the application of the method to incorporate the effects of human activities, and land use change.

AB A Gini-coefficient based stochastic optimization (GBSO) model was developed by integrating the hydrological model, water balance model, Gini coefficient and chance-constrained programming (CCP) into a general multi-objective optimization modeling framework for supporting water resources allocation at a watershed scale. The framework was advantageous in reflecting the conflicting equity and benefit objectives for water allocation, maintaining the water balance of watershed, and dealing with system uncertainties. GBSO was solved by the non-dominated sorting Genetic Algorithms-II (NSGA-II), after the parameter uncertainties of the hydrological model have been quantified into the probability distribution of runoff as the inputs of CCP model, and the chance constraints were converted to the corresponding deterministic versions. The proposed model was applied to identify the Pareto optimal water allocation schemes in the Lake Dianchi watershed, China. The optimal Pareto-front results reflected the tradeoff between system benefit (alpha(SB)) and Gini coefficient (alpha(G)) under different significance levels (i.e. q) and different drought scenarios, which reveals the conflicting nature of equity and efficiency in water allocation problems. A lower q generally implies a lower risk of violating the system constraints and a worse drought intensity scenario corresponds to less available water resources, both of which would lead to a decreased system benefit and a less equitable water allocation scheme. Thus, the proposed modeling framework could help obtain the Pareto optimal schemes under complexity and ensure that the proposed water allocation solutions are effective for coping with drought conditions, with a proper tradeoff between system benefit and water allocation equity.

AB In this study, we focus on the behavior of geogenic, toxic trace elements, particularly As, Cs, Cd, and Pb, during their transportation in two rivers for irrigation commonly used in monsoon Asia; one river originates from an active volcano, Mt. Asama, and the other originates from a currently inactive volcano, Yatsugatake Mountains in Nagano, Japan. These rivers were investigated to understand the role of river water as a pollutant of rice and other aquatic plants (via irrigation) and aquatic animals. The results indicated that the behavior of toxic trace elements in river water are likely controlled by their interactions with particulate Fe, Al, and Ti compounds. The majority of Pb and Cd is transported as particulate matter with Fe, Al, and Ti, while the majority of As is transported in the dissolved form, predominantly as arsenate, with low abundance of particulate matter. Cs is transported either as the dissolved form or as particulate matter in both rivers. The investigated elements are transported in the rivers as particulate and dissolved forms, and the ratio of these forms is controlled by the pH and presence of particulate Fe, Al, and Ti phases in the river water. With respect to Cs in both rivers, the parameter governing the concentration and transportation of Cs, in the bimodal form (i.e., particulate and dissolved forms), through the river possibly shifts from sorption to pH by particulate Fe-Al-Ti, according to the abrupt increase in the concentration of Cs in the river. The chemical attraction of particulate Fe-Al-Ti for Cs is weaker than that for Pb and Cd, indicating that the lower electronegativity of Cs weakens the chemical attraction on a colloid for the competitive sorption with the other trace elements. The different relationships between As and Fe in the river and in the irrigation water and soil water, as well as those in paddy rice, suggested that As in paddy rice is not directly derived from As in the irrigation water from the river under flooding.

AB During the last years there has been an increasing interest in assessing health risks caused by exposure to contaminants found in soil, air, and water, like heavy metals or emerging contaminants. This work presents a study on the spatial patterns and interaction effects among relevant heavy metals (Sb, As and Pb) that may occur together in different minerals. Total organic carbon (TOC) have been analyzed too because it is an essential component in the regulatory mechanisms that control the amount of metal in soils. Even more, exposure to these elements is associated with a number of diseases and environmental problems. These metals can have both natural and anthropogenic origins. A key component of any exposure study is a reliable model of the spatial distribution the elements studied. A geostatistical analysis have been performed in order to show that selected metals are auto-correlated and cross-correlated and type and magnitude of such cross-correlation varies depending on the spatial scale under consideration. After identifying general trends, we analyzed the residues left after subtracting the trend from the raw variables. Three scales of variability were identified (compounds or factors) with scales of 5, 35 and 135 km. The first factor (F1) basically identifies anomalies of natural origin but, in some places, of anthropogenics origin as well. The other two are related to geology (F2 and F3) although F3 represents more clearly geochemical background related to large lithological groups. Likewise, mapping of two major structures indicates that significant faults have influence on the distribution of the studied elements. Finally, influence of soil and lithology on groundwater by means of contingency analysis was assessed.

AB Urbanization disturbs groundwater flow through the sealing of native soils with impervious surfaces and through modifications to the subsoil by constructed drainage and other infrastructure (trenches and excavations, e.g. water supply). The impact of these disturbances on groundwater contributions to urban streams (i.e. baseflow) is poorly understood. While high flows caused by impervious runoff to streams are a common focus of urban studies, the route taken by groundwater to become streamflow in urban landscapes is not generally considered. To assess the impact of urbanization on groundwater sources to streams, both rainfall and baseflow were sampled weekly for stable isotopes of water in two nearby streams one draining a peri-urban catchment and the other draining a forested, natural catchment. In addition, to study the rate of groundwater discharge to the stream, monthly baseflow recession behavior was investigated. We found that baseflow in the forested catchment was constant in stable isotope values (delta O-18 =- 5.73 parts per thousand +/- 0.14 parts per thousand) throughout the year. Monthly baseflow recession constants were close to 1 and had little variation (ranging 0.951-0.992), indicating a well-mixed groundwater store and long residence times. In contrast, the urban baseflow isotopic composition featured distinct seasonal variations (delta O-18 =- 3.35 parts per thousand +/- 1.20 parts per thousand from October to March and delta O-18 = -4.54 parts per thousand +/- 0.43 parts per thousand from April to September) and high week-to-week variability in summer, reflecting a contribution of recent rainfall to baseflow. Recession constants were lower (ranging 0.727-0.955) with pronounced seasonal variations, suggesting shorter residence times and the likely presence of a variety of stores and pathways. These results provide evidence that the urban catchment has diversified groundwater pathways, and its groundwater storage is drained faster than that of the forested catchment. It highlights some of the subsurface hydrological consequences of urbanization. Restoring low-flow aspects of the flow regime through nature-mimicking stormwater management requires careful consideration of how the behavior of natural groundwater pathways can be restored or replicated using innovative stormwater control measures.

AB Micro-scale properties of peat pore space and their influence on hydraulic and transport properties of peat soils have been given little attention so far. Characterizing the variation of these properties in a peat profile can increase our knowledge on the processes controlling contaminant transport through peatlands. As opposed to the common macro-scale (or bulk) representation of groundwater flow and transport processes, a pore network model (PNM) simulates flow and transport processes within individual pores. Here, a pore network modeling code capable of simulating advective and diffusive transport processes through a 3D unstructured pore network was developed; its predictive performance was evaluated by comparing its results to empirical values and to the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. This is the first time that peat pore networks have been extracted from X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) images of peat deposits and peat pore characteristics evaluated in a 3D approach. Water flow and solute transport were modeled in the unstructured pore networks mapped directly from mu CT images. The modeling results were processed to determine the bulk properties of peat deposits. Results portray the commonly observed decrease in hydraulic conductivity with depth, which was attributed to the reduction of pore radius and increase in pore tortuosity. The increase in pore tortuosity with depth was associated with more decomposed peat soil and decreasing pore coordination number with depth, which extended the flow path of fluid particles. Results also revealed that hydraulic conductivity is isotropic locally, but becomes anisotropic after upscaling to core-scale; this suggests the anisotropy of peat hydraulic conductivity observed in core-scale and field-scale is due to the strong heterogeneity in the vertical dimension that is imposed by the layered structure of peat soils. Transport simulations revealed that for a given solute, the effective diffusion coefficient decreases with depth due to the corresponding increase of diffusional tortuosity. Longitudinal dispersivity of peat also was computed by analyzing advective-dominant transport simulations that showed peat dispersivity is similar to the empirical values reported in the same peat soil; it is not sensitive to soil depth and does not vary much along the soil profile.

AB Real time hydrologic forecasting requires near accurate initial condition of soil moisture; however, continuous monitoring of soil moisture is not operational in many regions, such as, in Ganga basin, extended in Nepal, India and Bangladesh. Here, we examine the impacts of perturbation/error in the initial soil moisture conditions on simulated soil moisture and streamfiow in Ganga basin and its propagation, during the summer monsoon season (June to September). This provides information regarding the required minimum duration of model simulation for attaining the model stability. We use the Variable Infiltration Capacity model for hydrological simulations after validation. Multiple hydrologic simulations are performed, each of 21 days, initialized on every 5th day of the monsoon season for deficit, surplus and normal monsoon years. Each of these simulations is performed with the initial soil moisture condition obtained from long term runs along with positive and negative perturbations. The time required for the convergence of initial errors is obtained for all the cases. We find a quick convergence for the year with high rainfall as well as for the wet spells within a season. We further find high spatial variations in the time required for convergence; the region with high precipitation such as Lower Ganga basin attains convergence at a faster rate. Furthermore, deeper soil layers need more time for convergence. Our analysis is the first attempt on understanding the sensitivity of hydrological simulations of Ganga basin on initial soil moisture conditions. The results obtained here may be useful in understanding the spin-up requirements for operational hydrologic forecasts.

AB Hyperconcentrated sediment-laden floods often occur in a braided reach of the Lower Yellow River, usually leading to significant channel evolution. A one-dimensional (1D) morphodynamic model using a dynamically coupled solution approach is developed to simulate hyperconcentrated flood and channel evolution in the braided reach with an extremely irregular cross-sectional geometry. In the model, the improved equations for hydrodynamics account for the effects of sediment concentration and bed evolution, which are coupled with the equations of non-equilibrium sediment transport and bed evolution. The model was validated using measurements from the 1977 and 2004 hyperconcentrated floods. Furthermore, the effects were investigated of different cross-sectional spacings and allocation modes of channel deformation area on the model results. It was found that a suitable cross-sectional distance of less than 3 km should be adopted when simulating hyperconcentrated floods, and the results using the uniform allocation mode can agree better with measurements than other two allocation modes.

AB River ice breakup dates (BDs) are not merely a proxy indicator of climate variability and change, but a direct concern in the management of local ice-caused flooding. A framework of stacking ensemble learning for annual river ice BDs was developed, which included two-level components: member and combining models. The member models described the relations between BD and their affecting indicators; the combining models linked the predicted BD by each member models with the observed BD. Especially, Bayesian regularization back-propagation artificial neural network (BRANN), and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) were employed as both member and combining models. The candidate combining models also included the simple average methods (SAM). The input variables for member models were selected by a hybrid filter and wrapper method. The performances of these models were examined using the leave-one-out cross validation. As the largest unregulated river in Alberta, Canada with ice jams frequently occurring in the vicinity of Fort McMurray, the Athabasca River at Fort McMurray was selected as the study area. The breakup dates and candidate affecting indicators in 1980-2015 were collected. The results showed that, the BRANN member models generally outperformed the ANFIS member models in terms of better performances and simpler structures. The difference between the R and MI rankings of inputs in the optimal member models may imply that the linear correlation based filter method would be feasible to generate a range of candidate inputs for further screening through other wrapper or embedded IVS methods. The SAM and BRANN combining models generally outperformed all member models. The optimal SAM combining model combined two BRANN member models and improved upon them in terms of average squared errors by 14.6% and 18.1% respectively. In this study, for the first time, the stacking ensemble learning was applied to forecasting of river ice breakup dates, which appeared promising for other river ice forecasting problems.

AB Snow has a unique characteristic in the water cycle, that is, snow falls during the entire winter season, but the discharge from snowmelt is typically delayed until the melting period and occurs in a relatively short period. Therefore, reliable observations from an optimal snow monitoring network are necessary for an efficient management of snowmelt water for flood prevention and hydropower generation. The Dual Entropy and Multiobjective Optimization is applied to design snow monitoring networks in La Grande River Basin in Quebec and Columbia River Basin in British Columbia. While the networks are optimized to have the maximum amount of information with minimum redundancy based on entropy concepts, this study extends the traditional entropy applications to the hydrometric network design by introducing several improvements. First, several data quantization cases and their effects on the snow network design problems were explored. Second, the applicability the Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) products as synthetic datasets of potential stations was demonstrated in the design of the snow monitoring network of the Columbia River Basin. Third, beyond finding the Pareto-optimal networks from the entropy with multi-objective optimization, the networks obtained for La Grande River Basin were further evaluated by applying three hydrologic models. The calibrated hydrologic models simulated discharges using the updated snow water equivalent data from the Pareto-optimal networks. Then, the model performances for high flows were compared to determine the best optimal network for enhanced spring runoff forecasting.

AB Lake Taihu is a typical shallow lake which frequently happens sediment resuspension induced by wind-induced waves. The experiments are carried on to simulate the wave disturbance processes in wave flume by setting a series of wave periods (1.2 s, 1.5 s, 1.8 s) and wave heights (2 cm, 10 cm). It aims to analyze the characteristics of sediment resuspension and the mechanisms of nutrients release and to evaluate the effects of sediment dredging on sediment resuspension and nutrients release in Lake Taihu. The results show that wave shear stress during 2 cm and 10 cm wave height processes ranges 0.018-0.023 N/m(2) and 0.221-0.307 N/m(2), respectively. Wave shear stress has no significant differences between wave periods. Wave height has much more effects on sediment resuspension. Wave height of 2 cm could induce total suspended solids (TSS) reaching up to 5.21 g/m(2) and resuspension flux of sediment (M) up to 1.74 g/m(2). TSS sharply increases to 30.33-52.41 g/m(2) and M reached up to 48.94 g/m(2) when wave height reaches to 10 cm. The disturbance depth under different sediment bulk weights ranges from 0.089 to 0.161 mm. Variation of suspended solids in 3 layers (1 cm, 5 cm, 20 cm above sediment interface) has no significant differences. Organic matter, TN and TP have positive relationship with SS. Organic matter is only accounted for 5.7%-7.3% of SS. The experiments under different sediment bulk densities (1.34 g/cm(3), 1.47 g/cm(3) and 1.59 g/cm(3)) find that TSS and M fall by 44.2% and 39.8% with sediment bulk density increasing, respectively. Total TN, DTN, TP and DTP decrease by 24.3%-33.6%. It indicates that sediment dredging could effectively reduce SS concentration and nutrient levels in water column. The researches provide a theoretical basis for sediment dredging to control the shore zone of Lake Taihu for lake management.

AB Quantitative understanding of controls on thaw layer thickness (TLT) dynamics in the Arctic peninsula is essential for predictive understanding of permafrost degradation feedbacks to global warming and hydro biochemical processes. This study jointly interprets electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) measurements and hydro-thermal numerical simulation results to assess spatiotemporal variations of TLT and to determine its controlling factors in Barrow, Alaska. Time-lapse ERT measurements along a 35-m transect were autonomously collected from 2013 to 2015 and inverted to obtain soil electrical resistivity. Based on several probe-based UT measurements and co-located soil electrical resistivity, we estimated the electrical resistivity thresholds associated with the boundary between the thaw layer and permafrost using a grid search optimization algorithm. Then, we used the obtained thresholds to derive the UT from all soil electrical resistivity images. The spatiotemporal analysis of the ERT-derived TLT shows that the TLT at high-centered polygons (HCPs) is smaller than that at low-centered polygons (LCPs), and that both thawing and freezing occur earlier at the HCPs compared to the LCPs. In order to provide a physical explanation for dynamics in the thaw layer, we performed 1-D hydro thermal simulations using the community land model (CLM). Simulation results showed that air temperature and precipitation jointly govern the temporal variations of UT, while the topsoil organic content (SOC) and polygon morphology are responsible for its spatial variations. When the topsoil SOC and its thickness increase, TLT decreases. Meanwhile, at LCPs, a thicker snow layer and saturated soil contribute to a thicker TLT and extend the time needed for TLT to freeze and thaw. This research highlights the importance of combination of measurements and numerical modeling to improve our understanding spatiotemporal variations and key controls of TLT in cold regions.

AB In this study, reference evapotranspiration (ETo) forecasting models are developed for the least economically developed regions subject to meteorological data scarcity. Firstly, the partial mutual information (PMI) capable of capturing the linear and nonlinear dependence is investigated regarding its utility to identify relevant predictors and exclude those that are redundant through the comparison with partial linear correlation. An efficient input selection technique is crucial for decreasing model data requirements. Then, the interconnection between global climate indices and regional ETo is identified. Relevant climatic indices are introduced as additional predictors to comprise information regarding ETo, which ought to be provided by meteorological data unavailable. The case study in the Jing River and Beiluo River basins, China, reveals that PMI outperforms the partial linear correlation in excluding the redundant information, favouring the yield of smaller predictor sets. The teleconnection analysis identifies the correlation between Nino 1 + 2 and regional ETo, indicating influences of ENSO events on the evapotranspiration process in the study area. Furthermore, introducing Nino 1 + 2 as predictors helps to yield more accurate ET forecasts. A model performance comparison also shows that nonlinear stochastic models (SVR or RF with input selection through PMI) do not always outperform linear models (MLR with inputs screen by linear correlation). However, the former can offer quite comparable performance depending on smaller predictor sets. Therefore, efforts such as screening model inputs through PMI and incorporating global climatic indices interconnected with ETo can benefit the development of ETo, forecasting models suitable for data-scarce regions.

AB The process of evaporation interacts with the soil, which has various comprehensive mechanisms. Multiphase flow models solve air, vapour, water, and heat transport equations to simulate non-isothermal soil moisture transport of both liquid water and vapor flow, but are only applied in non-vegetated soils. For (sparsely) vegetated soils often energy balance models are used, however these lack the detailed information on non-isothermal soil moisture transport. In this study we coupled a multiphase flow model with a two-layer energy balance model to study the impact of non-isothermal soil moisture transport on evaporation fluxes (i.e., interception, transpiration, and soil evaporation) for vegetated soils. The proposed model was implemented at an experimental agricultural site in Florida, US, covering an entire maize-growing season (67 days). As the crops grew, transpiration and interception became gradually dominated, while the fraction of soil evaporation dropped from 100% to less than 20%. The mechanisms of soil evaporation vary depending on the soil moisture content. After precipitation the soil moisture content increased, exfiltration of the liquid water flow could transport sufficient water to sustain evaporation from soil, and the soil vapor transport was not significant. However, after a sufficient dry-down period, the soil moisture content significantly reduced, and the soil vapour flow significantly contributed to the upward moisture transport in topmost soil. A sensitivity analysis found that the simulations of moisture content and temperature at the soil surface varied substantially when including the advective (i.e., advection and mechanical dispersion) vapour transport in simulation, including the mechanism of advective vapour transport decreased soil evaporation rate under wet condition, while vice versa under dry condition. The results showed that the formulation of advective soil vapor transport in a soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer continuum can affect the simulated evaporation fluxes, especially under dry condition.

AB Nitrogen reactive transport modeling is subject to uncertainty in model parameters, structures, and scenarios. By using a new variance-based global sensitivity analysis method, this paper identifies important parameters for nitrogen reactive transport with simultaneous consideration of these three uncertainties. A combination of three scenarios of soil temperature and two scenarios of soil moisture creates a total of six scenarios. Four alternative models describing the effect of soil temperature and moisture content are used to evaluate the reduction functions used for calculating actual reaction rates. The results show that for nitrogen reactive transport problem, parameter importance varies substantially among different models and scenarios. Denitrification and nitrification process is sensitive to soil moisture content status rather than to the moisture function parameter. Nitrification process becomes more important at low moisture content and low temperature. However, the changing importance of nitrification activity with respect to temperature change highly relies on the selected model. Model-averaging is suggested to assess the nitrification (or denitrification) contribution by reducing the possible model error. Despite the introduction of biochemical heterogeneity or not, fairly consistent parameter importance rank is obtained in this study: optimal denitrification rate (Kden) is the most important parameter; reference temperature (T-r) is more important than temperature coefficient WO; empirical constant in moisture response function (m) is the least important one. Vertical distribution of soil moisture but not temperature plays predominant role controlling nitrogen reaction. This study provides insight into the nitrogen reactive transport modeling and demonstrates an effective strategy of selecting the important parameters when future temperature and soil moisture carry uncertainties or when modelers face with multiple ways of establishing nitrogen models.

AB Hydrological dynamics act as a primary control on ecosystem function in mountain peatlands, serving as an important regulator of carbon fluxes. In western North America, mountain peatlands exist in different hydro geological settings, across a range climatic conditions, and vary in floristic composition. The sustainability of these ecosystems, particularly those at the low end of their known elevation range, is susceptible to a changing climate via changes in the water cycle. We conducted a hydrological investigation of two mountain peatlands, with differing vegetation, hydrogeological setting (sloping vs basin), and climate (strong vs weak monsoon influence). Growing season saturated zone water budgets were modeled on a daily basis, and subsurface flow characterizations were performed during multiple field campaigns at each site. The sloping peatland expectedly showed a strong lateral groundwater potential gradient throughout the growing season. Alternatively, the basin peatland had low lateral gradients but more pronounced vertical gradients. A zero-flux plane was apparent at a depth of approximately 50 cm below the peat surface at the basin peatland; shallow groundwater above this depth moved upward towards the surface via evapotranspiration. The differences in groundwater flow dynamics between the two sites also influenced water budgets. Higher groundwater inflow at the sloping peatland offset higher rates of evapotranspiration losses from the saturated zone, which were apparently driven by differences in vegetative cover. This research revealed that although sloping peatlands cover relatively small portions of mountain watersheds, they provide unique settings where vegetation directly utilizes groundwater for transpiration, which were several-fold higher than typically reported for surrounding uplands.

AB Hydrological and hydrodynamic models are core tools for simulation of large basins and complex river systems associated to wetlands. Recent studies have pointed towards the importance of online coupling strategies, representing feedbacks between floodplain inundation and vertical hydrology. Especially across semi-arid regions, soil-floodplain interactions can be strong. In this study, we included a two-way coupling scheme in a large scale hydrological-hydrodynamic model (MGB) and tested different model structures, in order to assess which processes are important to be simulated in large semi-arid wetlands and how these processes interact with water budget components. To demonstrate benefits from this coupling over a validation case, the model was applied to the Upper Niger River basin encompassing the Niger Inner Delta, a vast semi-arid wetland in the Sahel Desert. Simulation was carried out from 1999 to 2014 with daily TMPA 3B42 precipitation as forcing, using both in-situ and remotely sensed data for calibration and validation. Model outputs were in good agreement with discharge and water levels at stations both upstream and downstream of the Inner Delta (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) > 0.6 for most gauges), as well as for flooded areas within the Delta region (NSE = 0.6; r = 0.85). Model estimates of annual water losses across the Delta varied between 20.1 and 30.6 km(3)/yr, while annual evapotranspiration ranged between 760 mm/yr and 1130 mm/yr. Evaluation of model structure indicated that representation of both floodplain channels hydrodynamics (storage, bifurcations, lateral connections) and vertical hydrological processes (floodplain water infiltration into soil column; evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation and evaporation of open water) are necessary to correctly simulate flood wave attenuation and evapotranspiration along the basin. Two-way coupled models are necessary to better understand processes in large semi-arid wetlands. Finally, such coupled hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling proves to be an important tool for integrated evaluation of hydrological processes in such poorly gauged, large scale basins. We hope that this model application provides new ways forward for large scale model development in such systems, involving semi-arid regions and complex floodplains.

ID PRECIPITATION
AB The characterization of droughts and their impacts is very dependent on the time scale that is involved. In order to obtain an overall drought assessment, the cumulative effects of water deficits over different times need to be examined together. For example, the recently developed joint deficit index (JDI) is based on multivariate probabilities of precipitation over various time scales from 1- to 12-months, and was constructed from empirical copulas. In this paper, we examine the Gaussian copula model for the JDI. We model the covariance across the temporal scales with a two-parameter function that is commonly used in the specific context of spatial statistics or geostatistics. The validity of the covariance models is demonstrated with long-term precipitation series. Bootstrap experiments indicate that the Gaussian copula model has advantages over the empirical copula method in the context of drought severity assessment: (I) it is able to quantify droughts outside the range of the empirical copula, (ii) provides adequate drought quantification, and (iii) provides a better understanding of the uncertainty in the estimation.

AB The chloride mass balance method of estimating groundwater recharge is generally applied at a point scale but water resources management generally requires information at a regional scale. To estimate groundwater recharge regionally previously used upscaling methods have ranged from simple averaging to empirical relationships and geostatistical interpolation. This study combined the best components of these methods by using regression kriging: in data-sparse areas the recharge is upscaled using global regression equations with gridded rainfall and surface geology as covariates, while in data-dense areas the kriging of the regression equation residuals ensures that the upscaled recharge estimates respect the point estimates of recharge. The uncertainty in the recharge estimates was quantified using 1000 stochastic replicates of the chloride deposition of rainfall, the chloride exported in runoff, the chloride concentration of the groundwater and the regression equations used to perform the upscaling. This study focused on the coal bearing Sydney, Gunnedah, Gloucester and Surat Basins of Eastern New South Wales (Australia). Historically, groundwater recharge to the Permian units of these basins has received little attention due to their low yields of poor quality water. The increased potential extraction of regional groundwater due to coal development has demanded a greater understanding of the water balance. We found that recharge is highest in the younger productive aquifers (up to 20% of long-term mean annual rainfall) and lowest in the Permian units (-1% of long-term mean annual rainfall). The magnitude of the uncertainty is often close to the magnitude of the median recharge estimate. The method developed here for upscaling the point estimates of recharge using the chloride mass balance provides robust estimates of recharge and its associated uncertainty. The method is applicable to any regional study with variable density input data. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Coupled water and energy balance models have become increasingly popular for estimating groundwater recharge, because of the integration of energy and water balances and sometimes carbon balance. The additional balances are thought to constrain the water balance and as a result should help reduce the uncertainty of groundwater recharge. However, these models usually have a large number of parameters. The uncertainty of these parameters may result in a large uncertainty in groundwater recharge estimates. This study aims to assess the potential uncertainty of groundwater recharge estimated from a widely used water and energy model. It is largely based on annual pasture vegetation in the lower part of the Campaspe catchment in southeast Australia. A Monte Carlo analysis method was employed to examine potential uncertainties introduced by different types of errors. The results show that for a mean rainfall of 398 mm/y and using a particular set of pedotransfer functions for deriving soil hydraulic parameters, the estimated recharge ranged from 7 to 144 mm/y due to the uncertainty in vegetation parameters. This upper bound of the recharge range increased to 236 mm/y when using different sets of pedotransfer functions. Through several synthetic test cases, this study shows that soil moisture time series may not offer much help for reducing recharge uncertainty, whereas evapotranspiration time series are able to reduce recharge uncertainty by more than 50%. The reduction in recharge uncertainty steadily improves as the uncertainty in observations reduces. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB At approximately 18.0 ka, pluvial Lake Bonneville reached its maximum level. At its northeastern extent it was impounded by alluvium of the Marsh Creek Fan, which breached at some point north of Red Rock Pass (Idaho), leading to one of the largest floods on Earth. About 5320 km(3) of water was discharged into the Snake River drainage and ultimately into the Columbia River. We use a OD model and a 2D non-linear depth-averaged hydrodynamic model to aid understanding of outflow dynamics, specifically evaluating controls on the amount of water exiting the Lake Bonneville basin exerted by the Red Rock Pass outlet lithology and geometry as well as those imposed by the internal lake geometry of the Bonneville basin. These models are based on field evidence of prominent lake levels, hypsometry and terrain elevations corrected for post-flood isostatic deformation of the lake basin, as well as reconstructions of the topography at the outlet for both the initial and final stages of the flood. Internal flow dynamics in the northern Lake Bonneville basin during the flood were affected by the narrow passages separating the Cache Valley from the main body of Lake Bonneville. This constriction imposed a water level drop of up to 2.7 m at the time of peak-flow conditions and likely reduced the peak discharge at the lake outlet by about 6%. The modeled peak outlet flow is 0.85.10(6) m(3) s(-1). Energy balance calculations give an estimate for the erodibility coefficient for the alluvial Marsh Creek divide of similar to 0.005 m y(-1) Pa-1.5, at least two orders of magnitude greater than for the underlying bedrock at the outlet. Computing quasi steady-state water flows, water elevations, water currents and shear stresses as a function of the water-level drop in the lake and for the sequential stages of erosion in the outlet gives estimates of the incision rates and an estimate of the outflow hydrograph during the Bonneville Flood: About 18 days would have been required for the outflow to grow from 10% to 100% of its peak value. At the time of peak flow, about 10% of the lake volume would have already exited; eroding about 1 km(3) of alluvium from the outlet, and the lake level would have dropped by about 10.6 m.

AB Many rivers in the Pacific Northwest region of North America are anthropogenically manipulated via dam operations, leading to system-wide impacts on hydrodynamic conditions and aquatic communities. Understanding how darn operations alter abiotic and biotic variables is important for designing management actions. For example, in the Klamath River, dam outflows could be manipulated to alter water age and temperature to reduce risk of parasite infections in salmon by diluting or altering viability of parasite spores. However, sensitivity of water age and temperature to the riverine conditions such as bathymetry can affect outcomes from dam operations. To examine this issue in detail, we conducted a global sensitivity analysis of water age and temperature to a comprehensive set of hydraulics and meteorological parameters in the Klamath River, California, where management of salmonid disease is a high priority. We applied an analysis technique, which combined Latin-hypercube and one-at-a-time sampling methods, and included simulation runs with the hydrodynamic numerical model of the Lower Klamath. We found that flow rate and bottom roughness were the two most important parameters that influence water age. Water temperature was more sensitive to inflow temperature, air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, flow rate, and wet bulb temperature respectively. Our results are relevant for managers because they provide a framework for predicting how water within 'high infection risk' sections of the river will respond to dam water (low infection risk) input. Moreover, these data will be useful for prioritizing the use of water age (dilution) versus temperature (spore viability) under certain contexts when considering flow manipulation as a method to reduce risk of infection and disease in Klamath River salmon.

AB In the present study, the moisture distribution on the wetting front during drainage and imbibition in a 2D sand chamber is studied thoroughly. Based on the high-resolution data measured by light transmission method, the moisture distribution is observed and then analyzed quantitatively. During drainage and imbibition, different moisture distributions are observed: (a) during drainage, moisture contents fluctuate in a larger range and fingers can be seen on the wetting front; (b) while during imbibition, moisture contents fluctuate in a smaller range and the wetting front is more regular. The Hurst coefficients are successful in capturing different characteristics of the moisture distribution between drainage and imbibition. During imbibition, the Hurst coefficients are around 0.2 on the wetting front; while during drainage, the Hurst coefficients are around 0.5. As the porosity changes from 0.336 to 0.383, the moisture distribution in the sand chamber does not display obvious change. While as the imbibition rate increases from 5 ml/min to 400 ml/min, the moisture distribution on the wetting front becomes more uniform.

AB Valid and dependable water demand prediction is a major element of the effective and sustainable expansion of municipal water infrastructures. This study provides a novel approach to quantifying water demand through the assessment of climatic factors, using a combination of a pretreatment signal technique, a hybrid particle swarm optimisation algorithm and an artificial neural network (PSO-ANN). The Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) technique was adopted to decompose and reconstruct water consumption in relation to six weather variables, to create a seasonal and stochastic time series. The results revealed that SSA is a powerful technique, capable of decomposing the original time series into many independent components including trend, oscillatory behaviours and noise. In addition, the PSO-ANN algorithm was shown to be a reliable prediction model, outperforming the hybrid Backtracking Search Algorithm BSA-ANN in terms of fitness function (RMSE). The findings of this study also support the view that water demand is driven by climatological variables. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reliable streamflow forecasts can be highly valuable for water resources planning and management. In this study, we combined a hidden Markov model (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) for probabilistic monthly streamflow forecasting. The HMM is initialized using a kernelized K-medoids clustering method, and the Baum-Welch algorithm is then executed to learn the model parameters. GMR derives a conditional probability distribution for the predictand given covariate information, including the antecedent flow at a local station and two surrounding stations. The performance of HMM-GMR was verified based on the mean square error and continuous ranked probability score skill scores. The reliability of the forecasts was assessed by examining the uniformity of the probability integral transform values. The results show that HMM-GMR obtained reasonably high skill scores and the uncertainty spread was appropriate. Different HMM states were assumed to be different climate conditions, which would lead to different types of observed values. We demonstrated that the HMM-GMR approach can handle multimodal and heteroscedastic data.

AB High spatial variability of arsenic (As) concentration in geogenic As-contaminated groundwater has been commonly observed worldwide, but the underlying reasons remain not well understood. Selecting a sulfate-containing, As-affected aquifer at the Datong Basin, northern China as the study area and combining hydrogeochemical investigation and sediment extraction with reactive transport modeling, this work elucidated the roles of Fe-S-As interactions in regulating the vertical variation of As concentration in the groundwater. Dissolved As concentration varied between 0.05 and 18 mot/I, but generally increased in the depth of 20-25 m and then decreased in 25-30 m. The high-As groundwater contained low Fe(II) (<0.007 mmol/L) and up to 15 mu mol/L sulfide, in contrary to the S/SE Asian deltas/floodplains where high Fe(II) and As jointly occur in the groundwater devoid of sulfate reduction. The reductive dissolution of As bearing Fe(III) oxides coupled to the degradation of organic matter with an estimated maximum rate of 0.22 mmol C/L/yr, mainly accounted for the depth-dependent increase of As concentration in the upper part of the shallow aquifer (<25 m deep). However, the decreasing reactivity of Fe(III) oxides together with the increase of pH over depth rendered the majority of electrons being transferred to sulfate reduction. The Fe(II) sulfides formed as a consequence not only helped to restrict the build-up of Fe(II) in the groundwater but also probably co-precipitated As to prompt As decrease in the depth of 25-30 m. Arsenite adsorbed on remaining Fe(III) oxides and newly-formed Fe(II) sulfides is another important pool of As in the aquifer, which varies in response to the extents of Fe(III)-oxide and sulfate reduction and consequently alters As distribution coefficient between the solid and the aqueous phases. This study highlights the importance of coupled geochemical cycling of Fe, S and As for As mobilization and reveals how it regulates As partitioning between groundwater and sediments.

AB Influence diagnostics aim to identify a small number of influential data points that have a disproportionate impact on the model parameters and/or predictions. The key issues with current influence diagnostic techniques are that the regression-theory approaches do not provide hydrologically relevant influence metrics, while the case-deletion approaches are computationally expensive to calculate. The main objective of this study is to introduce a new two-stage hybrid framework that overcomes these challenges, by delivering hydrologically relevant influence metrics in a computationally efficient manner. Stage one uses computationally efficient regression-theory influence diagnostics to identify the most influential points based on Cook's distance. Stage two then uses case-deletion influence diagnostics to quantify the influence of points using hydrologically relevant metrics. To illustrate the application of the hybrid framework, we conducted three experiments on 11 hydro-climatologically diverse Australian catchments using the GR4J hydrological model. The first experiment investigated how many data points from stage one need to be retained in order to reliably identify those points that have the hightest influence on hydrologically relevant metrics. We found that a choice of 30-50 is suitable for hydrological applications similar to those explored in this study (30 points identified the most influential data 98% of the time and reduced the required recalibrations by 99% for a 10 year calibration period). The second experiment found little evidence of a change in the magnitude of influence with increasing calibration period length from 1, 2, 5 to 10 years. Even for 10 years the impact of influential points can still be high (>30% influence on maximum predicted flows). The third experiment compared the standard least squares (SLS) objective function with the weighted least squares (WLS) objective function on a 10 year calibration period. In two out of three flow metrics there was evidence that SLS, with the assumption of homoscedastic residual error, identified data points with higher influence (largest changes of 40%, 10%, and 44% for the maximum, mean, and low flows, respectively) than WLS, with the assumption of heteroscedastic residual errors (largest changes of 26%, 6%, and 6% for the maximum, mean, and low flows, respectively). The hybrid framework complements existing model diagnostic tools and can be applied to a wide range of hydrological modelling scenarios. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Salt flat brines are a major source of minerals and especially lithium. Moreover, valuable wetlands with delicate ecologies are also commonly present at the margins of salt flats. Therefore, the efficient and sustainable exploitation of the brines they contain requires detailed knowledge about the hydrogeology of the system. A critical issue is the freshwater-brine mixing zone, which develops as a result of the mass balance between the recharged freshwater and the evaporating brine.
   The complex processes occurring in salt flats require a three-dimensional (3D) approach to assess the mixing zone geometry. In this study, a 3D map of the mixing zone in a salt flat is presented, using the Salar de Atacama as an example. This mapping procedure is proposed as the basis of computationally efficient three-dimensional numerical models, provided that the hydraulic heads of freshwater and mixed waters are corrected based on their density variations to convert them into brine heads. After this correction, the locations of lagoons and wetlands that are characteristic of the marginal zones of the salt flats coincide with the regional minimum water (brine) heads.
   The different morphologies of the mixing zone resulting from this 3D mapping have been interpreted using a two-dimensional (2D) flow and transport numerical model of an idealized cross-section of the mixing zone. The result of the model shows a slope of the mixing zone that is similar to that obtained by 3D mapping and lower than in previous models. To explain this geometry, the 2D model was used to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity in the mixing zone geometry. The higher the permeability of the upper aquifer is, the lower the slope and the shallower the mixing zone become. This occurs because most of the freshwater lateral recharge flows through the upper aquifer due to its much higher transmissivity, thus reducing the freshwater head. The presence of a few meters of highly permeable materials in the upper part of these hydrogeological systems, such as alluvial fans or karstifled evaporites that are frequently associated with the salt flats, is enough to greatly modify the geometry of the saline interface.

AB Groundwater quality in many regions with intense agriculture has deteriorated due to the leaching of nitrate and other agricultural pollutants. Modified agricultural practices can reduce the input of nitrate to groundwater bodies, but it is crucial to determine the time span over which these measures become effective at reducing nitrate levels in pumping wells. Such estimates can be obtained from hydrogeological modeling or lumped-parameter models (LPM) in combination with environmental tracer data. Two challenges in such tracer-based estimates are (i) accounting for the different modes of transport in the unsaturated zone (USZ), and (ii) assessing uncertainties. Here we extend a recently published Bayesian inference scheme for simple LPMs to include an explicit USZ model and apply it to the Dfinnerngau aquifer, Switzerland. Compared to a previous estimate of travel times in the aquifer based on a 2D hydrogeological model, our approach provides a more accurate assessment of the dynamics of nitrate concentrations in the aquifer. We find that including tracer measurements (H-3/He-3, Kr-85, Ar-39, He-4) reduces uncertainty in nitrate predictions if nitrate time series at wells are not available or short, but does not necessarily lead to better predictions if long nitrate time series are available. Additionally, the combination of tracer data with nitrate time series allows for a separation of the travel times in the unsaturated and saturated zone. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of flow discharge (Q), slope gradient (S), flow velocity (V), shear stress (tau), stream power (omega) and unit stream power (U) on sediment concentration. Laboratory experiments were conducted using a 10 x 0.1 m rill flume under four flow discharges (2, 4, 8 and 16 L min(-1)), and five slope gradients (5 degrees, 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees). The results showed that the measured sediment concentration varied from 87.08 to 620.80 kg m(-3) with a mean value of 343.13 kg m(-3). Sediment concentration increased as a power function with flow discharge and slope gradient, with R-2 = 0.975 and NSE = 0.945. The sediment concentration was more sensitive to slope gradient than to flow discharge. The sediment concentration was well predicted by unit stream power (R-2 = 0.937, NSE = 0.865), whereas less satisfactorily by flow velocity (R-2 = 0.470, NSE = 0.539) and stream power (R-2 = 0.773, NSE = 0.732). In addition, using the equations to simulate the measured sediment concentration of other studies, the result further indicated that slope gradient, flow discharge and unit stream power were good predictors of sediment concentration. In general, slope gradient, flow discharge and unit stream power seem to be the preferred predictors for estimating sediment concentration.

AB The hydrological community often turns to widely available spatial datasets such as the NRCS Soil Survey Geographic database (SSURGO) to characterize the spatial variability of soil properties. When used to spatially characterize and parameterize watershed models, this has served as a reasonable first approximation when lacking localized or incomplete soil data. Within agriculture, soil data has been left relatively coarse when compared to numerous other data sources measured. This is because localized soil sampling is both expensive and time intense, thus a need exists in better connecting spatial datasets with ground observations. Given that hydrogeophysics is data-dense, rapid, non-invasive, and relatively easy to adopt, it is a promising technique to help dovetail localized soil sampling with spatially exhaustive datasets. In this work, we utilize two common near surface geophysical methods, cosmic-ray neutron probe and electromagnetic induction, to identify temporally stable spatial patterns of measured geophysical properties in three 65 ha agricultural fields in western Nebraska. This is achieved by repeat geophysical observations of the same study area across a range of wet to dry field conditions in order to evaluate with an empirical orthogonal function. Shallow cores were then extracted within each identified zone and water retention functions were generated in the laboratory. Using EOF patterns as a covariate, we quantify the predictive skill of estimating soil hydraulic properties in areas without measurement using a bootstrap validation analysis. Results indicate that sampling locations informed via repeat hydrogeophysical surveys, required only five cores to reduce the cross-validation root mean squared error by an average of 64% as compared to soil parameters predicted by a commonly used benchmark, SSURGO and ROSETTA. The reduction to five strategically located samples within the 65 ha fields reduces sampling efforts by up to similar to 90% as compared to the common practice of soil grid sampling every 1 ha.

AB A number of physical or data-driven models have been proposed to evaluate stream water temperatures based on hydrological and meteorological observations. However, physical models require a large amount of information that is frequently unavailable, while data-based models ignore the physical processes. Recently the air2stream model has been proposed as an intermediate alternative that is based on physical heat budget processes, but it is so simplified that the model may be applied like data-driven ones. However, the price for simplicity is the need to calibrate eight parameters that, although have some physical meaning, cannot be measured or evaluated a priori. As a result, applicability and performance of the air2stream model for a particular stream relies on the efficiency of the calibration method. The original air2stream model uses an inefficient 20-year old approach called Particle Swarm Optimization with inertia weight.
   This study aims at finding an effective and robust calibration method for the air2stream model. Twelve different optimization algorithms are examined on six different streams from northern USA (states of Washington, Oregon and New York), Poland and Switzerland, located in both high mountains, hilly and lowland areas. It is found that the performance of the air2stream model depends significantly on the calibration method. Two algorithms lead to the best results for each considered stream. The air2stream model, calibrated with the chosen optimization methods, performs favorably against classical streamwater temperature models. The MATLAB code of the air2stream model and the chosen calibration procedure (CoBiDE) are available as Supplementary Material on the Journal of Hydrology web page.

AB This paper is devoted to theoretical and experimental investigations of solute dispersion in heterogeneous porous media. Dispersion in heterogenous porous media has been reported to be scale-dependent, a likely indication that the proposed dispersion models are incompletely formulated. A high quality experimental data set of breakthrough curves in periodic model heterogeneous porous media is presented. In contrast with most previously published experiments, the present experiments involve numerous replicates. This allows the statistical variability of experimental data to be accounted for. Several models are benchmarked against the data set: the Fickian-based advection-dispersion, mobile immobile, multirate, multiple region advection dispersion models, and a newly proposed transport model based on pure advection. A salient property of the latter model is that its solutions exhibit a ballistic behaviour for small times, while tending to the Fickian behaviour for large time scales. Model performance is assessed using a novel objective function accounting for the statistical variability of the experimental data set, while putting equal emphasis on both small and large time scale behaviours. Besides being as accurate as the other models, the new purely advective model has the advantages that (i) it does not exhibit the undesirable effects associated with the usual Fickian operator (namely the infinite solute front propagation speed), and (ii) it allows dispersive transport to be simulated on every heterogeneity scale using scale-independent parameters.

AB Irrigation efficiency plays an important role in agricultural productivity; it affects farm-scale water demand, and the partitioning of irrigation losses into evaporative and non-evaporative components. This partitioning determines return flow generation and thus affects water availability. Over the last two decades, hydrologic and agricultural research communities have significantly improved our understanding of the impacts of climate change on water availability and food productivity. However, the impacts of climate change on the efficiency of irrigation systems, particularly on the partitioning between evaporative and non-evaporative losses, have received little attention. In this study, we incorporated a process-based irrigation module into a coupled hydrologic/agricultural modeling framework (VIC-CropSyst). To understand how climate change may impact irrigation losses, we applied VIC-CropSyst over the Yakima River basin, an important agricultural region in Washington State, U.S. We compared the historical period of 1980-2010 to an ensemble of ten projections of climate for two future periods: 2030-2060 and 2060-2090. Results averaged over the watershed showed that a 9% increase in evaporative losses will be compensated by a reduction of non-evaporative losses. Therefore, overall changes in future efficiency are negligible (-0.4%) while the Evaporative Loss Ratio (ELR) (defined as the ratio of evaporative to non-evaporative irrigation losses) is enhanced by 10%. This higher ELR is associated with a reduction in return flows, thus negatively impacting downstream water availability. Results also indicate that the impact of climate change on irrigation losses depend on irrigation type and climate scenarios. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The main goal of this study is to evaluate the reliability of the Mise-a-la-Masse (MALM) technique associated with saline tracer tests for the characterization of groundwater flow direction and velocity. The experimental site is located in the upper part of the Alento River alluvial plain (Campania Region, Southern Italy). In this paper we present the hydrogeological setting, the experimental setup and the relevant field results. Subsequently, we compare those data against the simulated results obtained with a 3D resistivity model of the test area, coupled with a model describing the Advection - Dispersion equation for continuous tracer injection. In particular, we calculate a series of 3D forward solutions starting from a reference model, all derived from electrical tomography results, but taking into consideration different values of mean flow velocity and directions. Each electrical resistivity 3D model is used to produce synthetic voltage maps for MALM surveys. Finally, the synthetic MALM voltage maps are compared with the ones measured in the field in order to assess the information content of the MALM dataset with respect to the groundwater field characteristics. The results demonstrate that the information content of the MALM data is sufficient to define important characteristics of the aquifer geometry and properties. This work shows how a combination of three-dimensional time-lapse modeling of flow, tracer transport and electrical current can substantially contribute towards a quantitative interpretation of MALM measurements during a saline tracer test. This approach can thus revive the use of MALM as a practical, low cost field technique for tracer test monitoring and aquifer hydrodynamic characterization. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB Over recent decades, regions of West and Central Africa have experienced different and significant changes in climatic patterns, which have significantly impacted hydrological regimes. Such impacts, however, are not fully understood at the regional scale, largely because of scarce hydroclimatic data. Therefore, the aim of this study is to (a) assemble a new, robust, reconstructed streamflow dataset of 152 gauging stations; (b) quantify changes in streamflow over 1950-2005 period, using these newly reconstructed datasets; (c) significantly reveal trends and variability in streamflow over West and Central Africa based on new reconstructions; and (d) assess the robustness of this dataset by comparing the results with those identified in key climatic drivers (e.g. precipitation and temperature) over the region. Gap filling methods applied to monthly time series (1950-2005) yielded robust results (median Kling-Gupta Efficiency > 0.75). The study underlines a good agreement between precipitation and streamflow trends and reveals contrasts between western Africa (negative trends) and Central Africa (positive trends) in the 1950s and 1960s. Homogenous dry conditions of the 1970s and 1980s, characterized by reduced significant negative trends resulting from quasi-decadal modulations of the trend, are replaced by wetter conditions in the recent period (1993-2005). The effect of this rainfall recovery (which extends to West and Central Africa) on increased river flows are further amplified by land use change in some Sahelian basins. This is partially offset, however, by higher potential evapotranspiration rates over parts of Niger and Nigeria. Crucially, the new reconstructed streamflow datasets presented here will be available for both the scientific community and water resource managers.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is of great importance due to its key role in water resource management. Surface energy modeling tools such as Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) can estimate the amount of evapotranspiration for every pixel of the satellite images. The main objective of this research is evaporation investigation from the freshwater bodies using SEBAL, METRIC, and SEBS. For this purpose, the Amirkabir dam reservoir and its nearby agricultural lands in a semi-arid climate were selected and studied from 2011 to 2017 as the study area. The implementations of this study were accomplished on 16 satellite images of Landsat TM5 and OLI. Then, SEBAL, METRIC, and SEBS were implemented on the selected images. Moreover, the corresponding pan evaporate measurements on the reservoir bank were considered as the ground truth data. Regarding to the results, SEBAL is not a reliable method to evaluate freshwater evaporation with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.36 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.1 mm. On the other hand, METRIC with RMSE and R-2 of 0,57 and 2.02 mm and SEBS with RMSE and R-2 of 0.93 and 0.62 demonstrated a relatively good performance.

AB Limestone aquifers are of great interest as a drinking water resource in many countries. They often have a complex crushed and fractured geology, which makes the analysis and description of flow and transport processes in such aquifers a challenging task. In this study, the solute transport behavior including fracture-matrix interaction in hydrogeological units of a limestone aquifer in eastern Denmark was characterized by designing, conducting and interpreting six depth-specific tracer tests involving natural- and forced-gradient conditions with multiple tracers representing different diffusion properties. To determine flow parameters, the tracer tests were complemented by a comprehensive set of depth-specific borehole and hydraulic tests.
   Based on the tests, a new and stronger conceptual understanding was developed for the different aquifer units. The investigated limestone aquifer is composed of a glacially crushed unit and two fractured units, with calcarenitic and bryozoan limestone of similar hydraulic properties. Hydraulic tests revealed that the crushed unit has a lower hydraulic conductivity than the fractured limestone units, likely due to the crushed conditions with small limestone clusters and small-aperture fractures potentially filled with fine material.
   In the fractured limestone units, a distinct preferential flow and primary transport along major horizontal fractures was inferred from the tracer tests under forced-gradient conditions. The dominant horizontal fractures were identified on impeller flow logs and appear connected between wells, having an extent of up to several hundred meters. Connectivity between the aquifer units was investigated with a long-term pumping test and tracer tests, revealing restricted vertical flow and transport. A very pronounced hydraulic conductivity contrast between major fractures and matrix could also be inferred from the borehole and hydraulic tests, which is consistent with the findings from the tracer tests. The difference in the matrix diffusion behavior of the simultaneously injected tracers and a long tailing in the breakthrough curves revealed that matrix diffusion has a strong influence on the solute transport in the fractured limestone.

AB Stable isotopes (delta H-2 and delta O-18) of water can help our understanding of origin, mixing and migration of groundwater. In the formation with low permeability, it provides information about migration mechanism of ion such as diffusion and/or advection. Thus it has been realized as very important information to understand the migration of water and ions in it. However, in formation with low permeability it is difficult to obtain the ground water sample as liquid and water in pores needs to be extracted to estimate it. Compressing rock is the most common and widely used method of extracting water in pores. However, changes in delta H-2 and delta O-18 may take place during compression because changes in ion concentration have been reported in previous studies.
   In this study, two natural rocks were compressed, and the changes in the delta H-2 and delta O-18 with compression pressure were investigated. Mechanisms for the changes in water isotopes observed during the compression were then discussed. In addition, delta H-2 and delta O-18 of water in pores were also evaluated by direct vapor equilibration and laser spectrometry (DVE-LS) and delta H-2 and delta O-18 were compared with those obtained by compression. delta H-2 was found to change during the compression and a part of this change was found to be explained by the effect of water from closed pores extracted by compression. In addition, water isotopes in both open and closed pores were estimated by combining the results of 2 kinds of compression experiments. Water isotopes evaluated by compression that not be affected by water from closed pores showed good agreements with those obtained by DVE-IS indicating compression could show the mixed information of water from open and closed pores, while DVE-LS could show the information only for open pores. Thus, the comparison of water isotopes obtained by compression and DVE-LS could provide the information about water isotopes in closed and open pores.

AB Headwater catchments provide substantial streamflow to rivers even during long periods of drought. Documenting the mean transit times (MTT) of stream water in headwater catchments and therefore the retention capacities of these catchments is crucial for water management. This study uses time series of H-3 activities in combination with major ion concentrations, stable isotope ratios and radon activities (Rn-222) in the Lyrebird Creek catchment in Victoria, Australia to provide a unique insight into the mean transit time distributions and flow systems of this small temperate headwater catchment. At all streamflows, the stream has H-3 activities (< 2.4 TU) that are significantly below those of rainfall (similar to 3.2 TU), implying that most of the water in the stream is derived from stores with long transit times. If the water in the catchment can be represented by a single store with a continuum of ages, mean transit times of the stream water range from similar to 6 up to 40 years, which indicates the large retention potential for this catchment. Alternatively, variations of H-3 activities, stable isotopes and major ions can be explained by mixing between of young recent recharge and older water stored in the catchment. While surface runoff is negligible, the variation in stable isotope ratios, major ion concentrations and radon activities during most of the year is minimal (+/- 12%) and only occurs during major storm events. This suggests that different subsurface water stores are activated during the storm events and that these cease to provide water to the stream within a few days or weeks after storm events. The stores comprise micro and macropore flow in the soils and saprolite as well as the boundary between the saprolite and the fractured bed rock. Hydrograph separations from three major storm events using Tritium, electrical conductivity and selected major ions as well a delta O-18 suggest a minimum of 50% baseflow at most flow conditions.
   We demonstrate that headwater catchments can have a significant storage capacity and that the relationship between long-water stores and fast storm event subsurface flow is complex. The study also illustrates that using H-3 to determine mean transit times is probably only valid for baseflow conditions where the catchment can be represented as a single store.
   The results of this study reinforce the need to protect headwater catchments from contamination and extreme land use changes.

AB Snow is an important component of the hydrological cycle. As a major part of the cryosphere, snow cover also represents a valuable terrestrial water resource. In the context of climate change, the dynamics of snow cover play a crucial role in rebalancing the global energy and water budgets. Remote sensing, hydrological modeling and in situ observations are three techniques frequently utilized for snow cover investigations. However, the uncertainties caused by systematic errors, scale gaps, and complicated snow physics, among other factors, limit the usability of these three approaches in snow studies. In this paper, an overview of the advantages, limitations and recent progress of the three methods is presented, and more effective ways to estimate snow cover properties are evaluated. The possibility of improving remotely sensed snow information using ground-based observations is discussed. As a rapidly growing source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), web-based geotagged photos have great potential to provide ground truth data for remotely sensed products and hydrological models and thus contribute to procedures for cloud removal, correction, validation, forcing and assimilation. Finally, this review proposes a synergistic framework for the future of snow cover research. This framework highlights the cross-scale integration of in situ and remotely sensed snow measurements and the assimilation of improved remote sensing data into hydrological models.

AB A modified Green-and-Ampt model is formulated to quantify infiltration on sloping terrain underlain by homogeneous soil wetted by surficial water application. This paper's theory for quantifying infiltration relies on the mathematical statement of the coupled partial differential equations (pdes) governing infiltration and runoff. These pdes are solved by employing an explicit finite-difference numerical method that yields the infiltration, the infiltration rate, the depth to the wetting front, the rate of runoff, and the depth of runoff everywhere on the slope during external wetting. Data inputs consist of a water application rate or the rainfall hyetograph of a storm of arbitrary duration, soil hydraulic characteristics and antecedent moisture, and the slope's hydraulic and geometric characteristics. The presented theory predicts the effect an advancing wetting front has on slope stability with respect to translational sliding. This paper's theory also develops the 1D pde governing suspended sediment transport and slope degradation caused by runoff influenced by infiltration. Three examples illustrate the application of the developed theory to calculate infiltration and runoff on a slope and their role on the stability of cohesive and cohesionless soils forming sloping terrain.

AB The hyporheic zone (HZ) plays an important role in stream ecology. Previous studies have mainly focused on the factors influencing the HZ in the steady state. However, the exchange between surface water and groundwater in the HZ can become transient during a storm. This study investigates the impacts of different rainfall patterns (varying in intensity and duration) on the HZ under transient conditions. A two-dimensional numerical model of a 10-m long and 2-m deep domain is developed, in which the streambed consists of a series of dunes. Brinkman-Darcy and Navier-Stokes equations are respectively solved for groundwater and surface water, and velocity and pressure are coupled at the interface (i.e., the streambed surface). To compare the results under different transient conditions, this study proposes two indicators, i.e., the influential time (IT, the time required for the HZ to return to its initial state once it starts to change) and the influential depth (ID, the maximum increment in the HZ depth). To detect the extent to which the HZ undergoes significant spatial changes, moving split-window and inflection point tests are conducted. The results indicate that rainfall intensity (RI) and rainfall duration (RD) both display logarithmic relationships with the IT and ID with high coefficients of determination, but only between certain lower and upper thresholds of the RI and RD. Moreover, the distributions of the IT and ID as a function of the RI and RD are mapped using the surface spline and kriging interpolation methods to facilitate future prediction of the IT and ID. In addition, it is observed that the IT has a linear negative correlation with the groundwater response while the ID is not affected by different groundwater responses. All of the derived relationships can be used to predict the impacts of a future rainfall event on the HZ.

AB Effective modelling and prediction of smaller time step rainfall is reported to be very difficult owing to its highly erratic nature. Accurate forecast of daily rainfall for longer duration (multi time step) may be exceptionally helpful in the efficient planning and management of water resources systems. Identification of inherent patterns in a rainfall time series is also important for an effective water resources planning and management system. In the present study, Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) is utilized to forecast the daily rainfall time series pertaining to Koyna watershed in Maharashtra, India, for 365 days after extracting various components of the rainfall time series such as trend, periodic component, noise and cyclic component. In order to forecast the time series for longer time step (365 days-one window length), the signal and noise components of the time series are forecasted separately and then added together. The results of the study show that the method of SSA could extract the various components of the time series effectively and could also forecast the daily rainfall time series for longer duration such as one year in a single run with reasonable accuracy.

AB Newly available, more detailed and accurate elevation data sets, such as Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) generated on the basis of imagery from terrestrial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), can be used to improve flood-model input data and consequently increase the accuracy of the flood modelling results. This paper presents the first application of the MBlend merging method and assesses the impact of combining different DEMs on flood modelling results. It was demonstrated that different raster merging methods can have different and substantial impacts on these results. In addition to the influence associated with the method used to merge the original DEMs, the magnitude of the impact also depends on (i) the systematic horizontal and vertical differences of the DEMs, and (ii) the orientation between the DEM boundary and the terrain slope. The greater water depth and flow velocity differences between the flood modelling results obtained using the reference DEM and the merged DEMs ranged from -9.845 to 0.002 m, and from 0.003 to 0.024 m s(-1) respectively; these differences can have a significant impact on flood hazard estimates. In most of the cases investigated in this study, the differences from the reference DEM results were smaller for the MBlend method than for the results of the two conventional methods. This study highlighted the importance of DEM merging when conducting flood modelling and provided hints on the best DEM merging methods to use.

AB Accurate models of soil moisture are vital for solving core problems in meteorology, hydrology, agriculture and ecology. The capacity for soil moisture modelling is growing rapidly with the development of high-resolution, continent-scale gridded weather and soil data together with advances in modelling methods. In particular, the GlobalSoilMap.net initiative represents next-generation, depth-specific gridded soil products that may substantially increase soil moisture modelling capacity. Here we present an implementation of Campbell's infiltration and redistribution model within the NicheMapR microclimate modelling package for the R environment, and use it to assess the predictive power provided by the GlobalSoilMap.net product Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA, similar to 100 m) as well as the coarser resolution global product SoilGrids (SG, similar to 250 m). Predictions were tested in detail against 3 years of root-zone (3-75 cm) soil moisture observation data from 35 monitoring sites within the OzNet project in Australia, with additional tests of the finalised modelling approach against cosmic-ray neutron (CosmOz, 0-50 cm, 9 sites from 2011 to 2017) and satellite (ASCAT, 0-2 cm, continent-wide from 2007 to 2009) observations. The model was forced by daily 0.05 degrees (similar to 5 km) gridded meteorological data. The NicheMapR system predicted soil moisture to within experimental error for all data sets. Using the SLGA or the SG soil database, the OzNet soil moisture could be predicted with a root mean square error (rinse) of similar to 0.075 m(3) m(-3) and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.65 consistently through the soil profile without any parameter tuning. Soil moisture predictions based on the SLGA and SG datasets were approximate to 17% closer to the observations than when using a chloropleth-derived soil data set (Digital Atlas of Australian Soils), with the greatest improvements occurring for deeper layers. The CosmOz observations were predicted with similar accuracy (r = 0.76 and rise of similar to.085 m(3) m(-3)). Comparisons at the continental scale to 0-2 cm satellite data (ASCAT) showed that the SLGA/SG datasets increased model fit over simulations using the DAAS soil properties (r similar to 0.63 & rinse 15% vs. r 0.48 & rise 18%, respectively). Overall, our results demonstrate the advantages of using GlobalSoilMap.net products in combination with gridded weather data for modelling soil moisture at fine spatial and temporal resolution at the continental scale.

AB Streamflow is an essential component of the hydrologic cycle in the regional and global scale and the main source of fresh water supply. It is highly associated with natural disasters, such as droughts and floods. Therefore, accurate streamflow forecasting is essential. Forecasting streamflow in general and monthly streamflow in particular is a complex process that cannot be handled by data-driven models (DDMs) only and requires pre-processing. Wavelet transformation is a pre-processing technique; however, application of continuous wavelet transformation (CWT) produces many scales that cause deterioration in the performance of any DDM because of the high number of redundant variables. This study proposes multigene genetic programming (MGGP) as a selection tool. After the CWT analysis, it selects important scales to be imposed into the artificial neural network (ANN). A basin located in the southeast of Turkey is selected as case study to prove the forecasting ability of the proposed model. One month ahead downstream flow is used as output, and downstream flow, upstream, rainfall, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration with associated lags are used as inputs. Before modeling, wavelet coherence transformation (WCT) analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between variables in the time-frequency domain. Several combinations were developed to investigate the effect of the variables on streamflow forecasting. The results indicated a high localized correlation between the streamflow and other variables, especially the upstream. In the models of the standalone layout where the data were entered to ANN and MGGP without CWT, the performance is found poor. In the best-scale layout, where the best scale of the CWT identified as the highest correlated scale is chosen and enters to ANN and MGGP, the performance increased slightly. Using the proposed model, the performance improved dramatically particularly in forecasting the peak values because of the inclusion of several scales in which seasonality and irregularity can be captured. Using hydrological and meteorological variables also improved the ability to forecast the streamflow.

AB The hydrological regime of a lake is largely dependent on its bathymetry. A dramatic water level reduction has occurred in Poyang Lake in recent years, coinciding with significant bed erosion. Few studies have focused on the influence of bathymetric changes on the hydrological regime in such a complex river-lake floodplain system. This study combined hydrological data and a physically based hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of the bathymetric changes (1998-2010) on the water level spatiotemporal distribution in Poyang Lake, based on a dry year (2006), a wet year (2010) and an average year (2000-2010). The following conclusions can be drawn from the results of this study: (1) The bed erosion of the northern outlet channel averaged 3 m, resulting in a decrease in the water level by 1.2-2 m in the northern channels (the most significantly influenced areas) and approximately 0.3 m in the central lake areas during low-level periods. The water levels below 16 m and 14 m were significantly affected during the rising period and recession period, respectively. The water level reduction was enhanced due to lower water levels. (2) The water surface profiles adjusted, and the rising and recession rates of the water level increased by 0.5-3.1 cm/d at the lake outlet. The bathymetric influence extended across the entire lake due to the emptying effect, resulting in a change in the water level distribution. The average annual outflow increased by 6.8%. (3) The bathymetric changes contributed approximately 14.4% to the extreme low water level in autumn 2006 and enhanced the drought in the dry season. This study quantified the impact of the bathymetric changes on the lake water levels, thereby providing a better understanding of the potential effects of continued sand mining operations and providing scientific explanations for the considerable variations in the hydrological regimes of Poyang Lake. Moreover, this study attempts to provide a reference for the assessment of similarly dramatic bathymetric changes in complex floodplain lakes.

AB Freshwater contained within the submarine extensions of coastal aquifers is increasingly proposed as a freshwater source for coastal communities. However, the extent to which offshore freshwater supports onshore pumping is currently unknown on a global scale. This study provides the first attempt to examine the likely prevalence of situations where offshore freshwater influences onshore salinities, considering various sites from around the world. The groundwater conditions in twenty-seven confined and semi confined coastal aquifers with plausible connections to inferred or observed offshore freshwater are explored. The investigation uses available onshore salinities and groundwater levels, and offshore salinity knowledge, in combination with analytical modelling, to develop simplified conceptual models of the study sites. Seven different conceptual models are proposed based on the freshwater-saltwater extent and insights gained from analytical modelling. We consider both present-day and pre-development conditions in assessing potential modern contributions to offshore fresh groundwater. Conceptual models also include interpretations of whether offshore freshwater is a significant factor influencing onshore salinities and well pumping sustainability. The results indicate that onshore water levels have declined between pre-development and present-day conditions in fourteen of the fifteen regions for which pre-development data are available. Estimates of the associated steady-state freshwater extents show the potential for considerable offshore fresh groundwater losses accompanying these declines. Both present-day and pre-development heads are insufficient to account for the observed offshore freshwater in all cases where adequate data exist. This suggests that paleo-freshwater and/or aquifer heterogeneities contribute significantly to offshore freshwater extent. Present-day heads indicate that active seawater intrusion (SWI) will eventually impact onshore pumping wells at fourteen of the twenty-seven sites, while passive SWI is expected onshore in an additional ten regions. Albeit the number of field sites is limited, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that when offshore freshwater has an onshore linkage, it is being mined either passively or actively by onshore use. Thus, offshore freshwater should be assessed in coastal water balances presuming that it serves as an existing freshwater input, rather than as a new potential freshwater resource.

AB Among different reference evapotranspiration (ETo) modeling approaches, mass transfer-based methods have been less studied. These approaches utilize temperature and wind speed records. On the other hand, the empirical equations proposed in this context generally produce weak simulations, except when a local calibration is used for improving their performance. This might be a crucial drawback for those equations in case of local data scarcity for calibration procedure. So, application of heuristic methods can be considered as a substitute for improving the performance accuracy of the mass transfer-based approaches. However, given that the wind speed records have usually higher variation magnitudes than the other meteorological parameters, application of a wavelet transform for coupling with heuristic models would be necessary. In the present paper, a coupled wavelet -random forest (WRF) methodology was proposed for the first time to improve the performance accuracy of the mass transfer-based ETo estimation approaches using cross-validation data management scenarios in both local and cross-station scales. The obtained results revealed that the new coupled WRF model (with the minimum scatter index values of 0.150 and 0.192 for local and external applications, respectively) improved the performance accuracy of the single RF models as well as the empirical equations to great extent.

AB Fractured crystalline aquifers of mountain watersheds may host a significant portion of the world's freshwater supply. To effectively utilize water resources in these environments, it is important to understand the hydraulic properties, groundwater storage, and flow processes in crystalline aquifers and field-derived insights are critically needed. Based on borehole hydraulic characterization and monitoring data, this study inferred hydraulic properties and groundwater flow of a crystalline fractured aquifer in Laramie Range, Wyoming. At three open holes completed in a fractured granite aquifer, both slug tests and FLUTe liner profiling were performed to obtain estimates of horizontal hydraulic conductivity (K-h). Televiewer (i.e., optical and acoustic) and flowmeter logs were then jointly interpreted to identify the number of flowing fractures and fracture zones. Based on these data, hydraulic apertures were obtained for each borehole. Average groundwater velocity was then computed using K-h, aperture, and water level monitoring data. Finally, based on all available data, including cores, borehole logs, LIDAR topography, and a seismic P-wave velocity model, a three dimensional geological model of the site was built. In this fractured aquifer, (1) borehole K-h, varies over similar to 4 orders of magnitude (10(-8)-10(-5) m/s). K-h is consistently higher near the top of the bedrock that is interpreted as the weathering front. Using a cutoff K-h of 10(-10)m/s, the hydraulically significant zone extends to similar to 40-53 m depth. (2) FLUTe-estimated hydraulic apertures of fractures vary over 1 order of magnitude, and at each borehole, the average hydraulic aperture by FLUTe is very close to that obtained from slug tests. Thus, slug test can be used to provide a reliable estimate of the average fracture hydraulic aperture. (3) Estimated average effective fracture porosity is 4.0 x 10(-4), therefore this fractured aquifer can host significant quantity of water. (4) Natural groundwater velocity is estimated to range from 0.4 to 81.0 m/day, implying rapid pathways of fracture flow. (5) The average ambient water table position follows the boundary between saprolite and fractured bedrock. Groundwater flow at the site appears topography driven.

AB Climate change will affect precipitation and flood regimes. It is anticipated that the Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) and Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) will be modified in a changing climate. This paper aims to quantify and analyze climate change influences on PMP and PMF in three watersheds with different climatic conditions across the province of Quebec, Canada. Output data from the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) was used to estimate PMP and Probable Maximum Snow Accumulation (PMSA) in future climate projections, which was then used to force the SWAT hydrological model to estimate PMF. PMP and PMF values were estimated for two time horizons each spanning 30 years: 1961-1990 (recent past) and 2041-2070 (future). PMP and PMF were separately analyzed for two seasons: summer-fall and spring. Results show that PMF in the watershed located in southern Quebec would remain unchanged in the future horizon, but the trend for the watersheds located in the northeastern and northern areas of the province is an increase of up to 11%.

AB The stable isotope composition of precipitation records processes taking place within the hydrological cycle. Potentially, moisture sources are important controls on the stable isotope composition of precipitation, but studies focused on this topic are still scarce. We studied the moisture sources contributing to precipitation at Postojna (Slovenia) from 2009 to 2013. Back trajectory analyses were computed for the days with precipitation at Postojna. The moisture uptake locations were identified along these trajectories using standard hydro meteorological formulation. The moisture uptake locations were integrated in eight source regions to facilitate its comparison to the monthly oxygen isotope composition (delta O-18 values) of precipitation. Nearly half of the precipitation originated from continental sources (recycled moisture), and > 40% was from central and western Mediterranean. Results show that moisture sources do not have a significant impact on the oxygen isotope composition at this site. We suggest that the large proportion of recycled moisture originated from transpiration rather than evaporation, which produced water vapour with less negative delta O-18 values. Thus the difference between the oceanic and local vapour source was reduced, which prevented the distinction of the moisture sources based on their oxygen isotope signature. Nevertheless, delta O-18 values of precipitation are partially controlled by climate parameters, which is of major importance for paleoclimate studies. We found that the main climate control on Postojna delta O-18 values of precipitation is the surface temperature. Amount effect was not recorded at this site, and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) does not impact the delta O-18 values of precipitation. The Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO) was correlated to oxygen stable isotope composition, although this atmospheric pattern was not a control. Instead we found that the link to delta O-18 values results from synoptic scenarios affecting WeMO index as well as temperature. Therefore, interpretation of delta O-18 values of precipitation in terms of climate is limited to surface temperature, although at least half of the variability observed still depends on unknown controls of the hydrological cycle.

AB Stream and groundwater interactions play an essential role in regulating flow, temperature, and water quality for stream ecosystems. Temperature gradients have been used to quantify vertical water movement in the streambed since the 1960s, but advancements in thermal methods are still possible. Seepage runs are a method commonly used to quantify exchange rates through a series of streamflow measurements but can be labor and time intensive. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a thermal equilibrium method as a technique for quantifying groundwater flux using monitored stream water temperature at a single point and readily available hydrological and atmospheric data. Our primary assumption was that stream water temperature at the monitored point was at thermal equilibrium with the combination of all heat transfer processes, including mixing with groundwater. By expanding the monitored stream point into a hypothetical, horizontal one-dimensional thermal modeling domain, we were able to simulate the thermal equilibrium achieved with known atmospheric variables at the point and quantify unknown groundwater flux by calibrating the model to the resulting temperature signature. Stream water temperatures were monitored at single points at nine streams in the Ozark Highland ecoregion and five reaches of the Kiamichi River to estimate groundwater fluxes using the thermal equilibrium method. When validated by comparison with seepage runs performed at the same time and reach, estimates from the two methods agreed with each other with an R-2 of 0.94, a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.08 (m/d) and a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.93. In conclusion, the thermal equilibrium method was a suitable technique for quantifying groundwater flux with minimal cost and simple field installation given that suitable atmospheric and hydrological data were readily available.

AB The Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission (SWOT), scheduled for launch in 2021, will deliver two-dimensional observations of water surface heights for lakes, rivers wider than 100 m and oceans. Even though the scientific literature has highlighted several fields of application for the expected products, detailed simulations of the SWOT radar performance for a realistic river scenario have not been presented in the literature. Understanding the error of the most fundamental "raw" SWOT hydrology product is important in order to have a greater awareness about strengths and limits of the forthcoming satellite observations. This study focuses on a reach (similar to 140 km in length) of the middle-lower portion of the Po River, in Northern Italy, and, to date, represents one of the few real-case analyses of the spatial patterns in water surface elevation accuracy expected from SWOT. The river stretch is characterized by a main channel varying from 100 to 500 m in width and a large floodplain (up to 5 km) delimited by a system of major embankments. The simulation of the water surface along the Po River for different flow conditions (high, low and mean annual flows) is performed with inputs from a quasi-2D model implemented using detailed topographic and bathymetric information (LiDAR, 2 m resolution). By employing a simulator that mimics many SWOT satellite sensor characteristics and generates proxies of the remotely sensed hydrometric data, this study characterizes the spatial observations potentially provided by SWOT. We evaluate SWOT performance under different hydraulic conditions and assess possible effects of river embankments, river width, river topography and distance from the satellite ground track. Despite analyzing errors from the raw radar pixel cloud, which receives minimal processing, the present study highlights the promising potential of this Ka-band interferometer for measuring water surface elevations, with mean elevation errors of 0.1 cm and 21 cm for high and low flows, respectively. Results of the study characterize the expected performance of the upcoming SWOT mission and provide additional insights into potential applications of SWOT observations.

AB Sediment connectivity has been shown in recent years to explain how the watershed configuration controls sediment transport. However, we find no studies develop a watershed erosion modeling framework based on sediment connectivity, and few, if any, studies have quantified sediment connectivity for gently rolling systems. We develop a new predictive sediment connectivity model that relies on the intersecting probabilities for sediment supply, detachment, transport, and buffers to sediment transport, which is integrated in a watershed erosion model framework. The model predicts sediment flux temporally and spatially across a watershed using field reconnaissance results, a high-resolution digital elevation models, a hydrologic model, and shear-based erosion formulae. Model results validate the capability of the model to predict erosion pathways causing sediment connectivity. More notably, disconnectivity dominates the gently rolling watershed across all morphologic levels of the uplands, including, microtopography from low energy undulating surfaces across the landscape, swales and gullies only active in the highest events, karst sinkholes that disconnect drainage areas, and flood plains that de-couple the hillslopes from the stream corridor. Results show that sediment connectivity is predicted for about 2% or more the watershed's area 37 days of the year, with the remaining days showing very little or no connectivity. Only 12.8 +/- 0.7% of the gently rolling watershed shows sediment connectivity on the wettest day of the study year. Results also highlight the importance of urban/suburban sediment pathways in gently rolling watersheds, and dynamic and longitudinal distributions of sediment connectivity might be further investigated in future work. We suggest the method herein provides the modeler with an added tool to account for sediment transport criteria and has the potential to reduce computational costs in watershed erosion modeling.

AB The scientific explanation of speleothem delta O-18 in Chinese monsoon region is a greatly debated issue. Modern cave monitoring combined with instrument observation maybe is an essential solution to deal with this issue. During the period from 2011 to 2016, we monitored local precipitation, soil water in three soil profiles, and six drip water sites in Yangkou Cave, which is located in Chongqing City, Southwest China. This article presents measurements about delta O-18, SD and Mg/Ca ratios of drip water and compared these geochemical proxies with contemporaneous atmospheric circulations. The main conclusions are: (1) As water migrates from precipitation to soil water to cave drip water, the amplitudes of seasonal variations in SD and delta O-18 decreased gradually. Due to the existence of complex hydrogeological conditions, the range of variation and the seasonal characteristics of SD and delta O-18 differ among the drip sites where samples were collected, but the interannual variability is nearly the same. The drip water Mg/Ca ratios are mainly regulated by changes in hydrological conditions in the epikarst zone, with higher values during winter months than that during summer months. (2) When an El Nino event occurs, the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) is migrated westward, and the production of near source water vapor from the western Pacific and the South China Sea increases, leading to higher delta O-18 values in the precipitation and the cave drip water. The drip water Mg/Ca ratios were significantly lower with increased summer precipitation. On the other hand, during La Nina events, the WPSH is migrated eastward, and inputs of water vapor that has traveled greater distances (from the Indian Ocean) become comparatively important, resulting in lower delta O-18 values in the precipitation and the cave drip water. The drip water Mg/Ca ratios were higher with decreased summer precipitation. In summary, the interannual variability of delta O-18 in the drip waters of Yangkou Cave reflects changes in water vapor sources caused by atmospheric circulation patterns. Mg/Ca ratios respond to changes of precipitation and CO2 in soil and can be used to reconstruct abnormal drought or flood events.

AB Predicting water table depth over the long-term in agricultural areas presents great challenges because these areas have complex and heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics, boundary conditions, and human activities; also, nonlinear interactions occur among these factors. Therefore, a new time series model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was developed in this study as an alternative to computationally expensive physical models. The proposed model is composed of an LSTM layer with another fully connected layer on top of it, with a dropout method applied in the first LSTM layer. In this study, the proposed model was applied and evaluated in five sub-areas of Hetao Irrigation District in arid northwestern China using data of 14 years (2000-2013). The proposed model uses monthly water diversion, evaporation, precipitation, temperature, and time as input data to predict water table depth. A simple but effective standardization method was employed to pre-process data to ensure data on the same scale. 14 years of data are separated into two sets: training set (2000-2011) and validation set (2012-2013) in the experiment. As expected, the proposed model achieves higher R-2 scores (0.789-0.952) in water table depth prediction, when compared with the results of traditional feed-forward neural network (FFNN), which only reaches relatively low R-2 scores (0.004-0.495), proving that the proposed model can preserve and learn previous information well. Furthermore, the validity of the dropout method and the proposed model's architecture are discussed. Through experimentation, the results show that the dropout method can prevent overfitting significantly. In addition, comparisons between the R-2 scores of the proposed model and Double-LSTM model (R-2 scores range from 0.170 to 0.864), further prove that the proposed model's architecture is reasonable and can contribute to a strong learning ability on time series data. Thus, one can conclude that the proposed model can serve as an alternative approach predicting water table depth, especially in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain.

First, a total of 12 soils are investigated to reveal the influences of water and soil properties on the saturation dependence of the complex conductivity below 100 Hz. Results show that the magnitude of the complex conductivity consistently decreases with decreasing water saturation for all soils samples. The saturation n and quadrature conductivity p exponents tend to increase slightly with increasing water salinity when using a linear conductivity model. The saturation exponent increases marginally with the cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the specific surface area (S-sp) while the quadrature conductivity exponent exhibits a relatively stronger dependence on both CEC and S-sp. For the low CEC soil samples (normally <= 10 meq/100 g), the quadrature conductivity exponent p correlates well with the saturation exponent n using the relationship p = n- 1. SIP method is further applied in a sandbox experiment to estimate the saturation distribution and total volume of the oil. Results demonstrate that the SIP method has a great potential for mapping the organic contaminant plume and quantifying the oil volume.

AB Current physically based erosion models do not carefully consider the dynamic variations of soil properties during rainfall and are unable to simulate saline-sodic soil slope erosion processes. The aim of this work was to build upon a complete model framework, SSEM, to simulate runoff and erosion processes for saline-sodic soils by coupling dynamic saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks and soil erodibility K-tau. Sixty rainfall simulation rainfall experiments (2 soil textures x 5 sodicity levels x 2 slope gradients x 3 duplicates) provided data for model calibration and validation. SSEM worked very well for simulating the runoff and erosion processes of saline-sodic silty clay. The runoff and erosion processes of saline-sodic silt loam were more complex than those of non-saline soils or soils with higher clay contents; thus, SSEM did not perform very well for some validation events. We further examined the model performances of four concepts: Dynamic Ks and K-tau (Case 1, SSEM), Dynamic Ks and Constant K-tau (Case 2), Constant Ks and Dynamic K-tau (Case 3) and Constant Ks and Constant K-tau (Case 4). The results demonstrated that the model, which considers dynamic variations in soil saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil erodibility, can provide more reasonable runoff and erosion prediction results for saline-sodic soils.

AB Chronic groundwater decline is a concern in many of the world's major agricultural areas. However, a general lack of accurate long-term in situ measurement of groundwater depth and analysis of trends prevents understanding of the dynamics of these systems at landscape scales. This is particularly worrying in the context of future climate uncertainties. This study examines long-term groundwater responses to climate variability in a major agricultural production landscape in southern Queensland, Australia. Based on records for 381 groundwater bores, we used a modified Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and Sen's slope estimator to determine groundwater trends across a 26-year period (1989-2015) and in distinct wet and dry climatic phases. Comparison of trends between climatic phases showed groundwater level recovery during wet phases was insufficient to offset the decline in groundwater level from the previous dry phase. Across the entire 26-year sampling period, groundwater bore levels (all bores) showed an overall significant declining trend (p < 0.05) of an average 0.06 m year(-1). Fifty-one bores (20%) exhibited significant declining groundwater levels (p < 0.05), 25 bores (10%) exhibited significant rising groundwater levels (p < 0.05), and 175 bores (70%) exhibited no significant change in groundwater levels (p > 0.05). Spatially, both declining and rising bores were highly clustered. We conclude that over 1989-2015 there is a significant net decline in groundwater levels driven by a smaller subset of highly responsive bores in high irrigation areas within the catchment. Despite a number of targeted policy interventions, chronic groundwater decline remains evident in the catchment. We argue that this is likely to continue and to occur more widely under potential climate change and that policy makers, groundwater users and managers need to engage in planning to ensure the sustainability of this vital resource.

AB A methodology based on general hydraulic relations for rivers has been developed to estimate the discharge (flow rate) of rivers using satellite remote sensing observations. The estimates of discharge, flow depth, and flow velocity are derived from remotely observed water surface area, water surface slope, and water surface height, and demonstrated for two reaches of the Yukon River in Alaska, at Eagle (reach length 34.7 km) and near Stevens Village (reach length 38.3 km). The method is based on fundamental equations of hydraulic flow resistance in rivers, including the Manning equation and the Prandtl-von Karman universal velocity distribution equation. The method employs some new hydraulic relations to help define flow resistance and height of the zero flow boundary in the channel. Estimates are made both with and without calibration. The water surface area of the river reach is measured by using a provisional version of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat based product named Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE). The water surface height and slope measurements require a self-consistent datum, and are derived from observations from the Jason-2 satellite altimeter mission. At both reach locations, the Jason-2 radar altimeter non-winter heights consistently tracked the stage recorded at USGS streamgages with a standard deviation of differences (error) during the non-winter periods of less than 7%. Part of the error may be due to differences in the gage and altimeter crossing locations with respect to the range of stage change and the response to changes in discharge at the upstream and downstream locations. For the non winter periods, the radar derived slope estimates (mean = 0.0003) were constant over the mission lifetime, and in agreement with previously measured USGS water surface slopes and slopes determined from USGS topographic maps. The accuracy of the mean of the uncalibrated daily estimates of discharge varied between reaches, ranging from 13% near Stevens Village (N = 90) to 21% at Eagle (N = 246) based on the absolute error, and 5% to 6% based on the error of the log of the estimates. Calibrating to the mean of USGS daily discharge estimates from the streamflow rating for the same period of record at each streamgage resulted in mean absolute errors ranging from 1% to 2%, and log errors ranging from 1% or less. The error pattern of the estimates shows that without calibration, even though the mean is well simulated, the high and low end values over the range of estimates may have significant bias.

AB Uncertainties about the age of base-flow discharge can have serious implications for the management of degraded environmental systems where subsurface pathways, and the ongoing release of pollutants that accumulated in the subsurface during past decades, dominate the water quality signal. Numerical groundwater models may be used to estimate groundwater return times and base-flow ages and thus predict the time required for stakeholders to see the results of improved agricultural management practices. However, the uncertainty inherent in the relationship between (i) the observations of atmospherically-derived tracers that are required to calibrate such models and (ii) the predictions of system age that the observations inform have not been investigated. For example, few if any studies have assessed the uncertainty of numerically-simulated system ages or evaluated the uncertainty reductions that may result from the expense of collecting additional subsurface tracer data. In this study we combine numerical flow and transport modeling of atmospherically-derived tracers with prediction uncertainty methods to accomplish four objectives. First, we show the relative importance of head, discharge, and tracer information for characterizing response times in a uniquely data rich catchment that includes 266 age-tracer measurements (SF6, CFCs, and H-3) in addition to long term monitoring of water levels and stream discharge. Second, we calculate uncertainty intervals for model-simulated base-flow ages using both linear and non-linear methods, and find that the prediction sensitivity vector used by linear first order second-moment methods results in much larger uncertainties than non-linear Monte Carlo methods operating on the same parameter uncertainty. Third, by combining prediction uncertainty analysis with multiple models of the system, we show that data-worth calculations and monitoring network design are sensitive to variations in the amount of water leaving the system via stream discharge and irrigation withdrawals. Finally, we demonstrate a novel model-averaged computation of potential data worth that can account for these uncertainties in model structure. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The LOMOS-mini is a new experimental system monitoring transient water and heat fluxes in the hyporheic zone at a sub-daily resolution. Given the coupling of high-frequency hydraulic head gradient and temperature measurements, its innovation when compared to currently available monitoring systems is to operate under transient conditions and to allow the quantification of coupled water and heat exchanges with an unprecented fine temporal resolution, such as the rainfall event time scale. The LOMOS-mini is low-cost, easy to construct from individual microelectronic components and has an autonomy of several months in the field. Its robust implementation protocol makes it suitable for a wide variety of geological environments, from soft loamy, sandy, clayey streambeds to compact colluvial environments. Hydraulic head gradients are measured using the pressure sensor technology presented in Greswell et al. (2009). The sensibility of pressure estimates to ambient temperature is demonstrated; the measurement error is evaluated to decrease by up to one order of magnitude when accounting for temperature in the calibration relationship. Coupled with a physically-based hydrothermal model, the LOMOS-mini provides transient estimates of vertically distributed Darcy fluxes, conductive and advective heat fluxes. The methodology is illustrated on a colluvial streambed case study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is predicted to lead to an increased frequency of high intensity rainfall events. The impact on groundwater resources, particularly in areas of fractured bedrock aquifer systems, requires knowledge of how recharge is affected. In this study, the response of a fractured bedrock aquifer to heavy rainfall events is characterized. The study area is the Gulf Islands, a temperate region in British Columbia, Canada. Of the 14 provincial observation wells with hourly groundwater level data, only three showed pronounced responses to heavy rain events and were analyzed in detail. A detailed analysis at one well suggests rises in groundwater level were better correlated to all rain events than exclusively heavy rain during summer. The strength of the correlation decreased as the rainfall intensity increased. Solution of the Green-Ampt equation for rainfall events of varying magnitude indicated that an increase in rainfall intensity leads to more surface ponding and overland flow. Thus, the occurrence of more frequent heavy rain events in the future may result in lower net recharge. Thermal infrared images in seepage areas and the delta O-18 and delta H-2 composition for precipitation and seepage suggest rapid seepage responses to heavy rain events and rapid seepage dissipation rates. The overall rapid response of the fractured bedrock was advantageous for studying the response of the system to heavy rain events. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing demand on groundwater resources motivates understanding of the controls on recharge dynamics so model predictions under current and future climate may improve. Here we address questions about the nonlinear behavior of flux variability in the vadose zone that may explain previously reported teleconnections between global-scale climate variability and fluctuations in groundwater levels. We use hundreds of HYDRUS-1D simulations in a sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate the damping depth of transient recharge over a range of periodic boundary conditions and vadose zone geometries and hydraulic parameters that are representative of aquifer systems of the conterminous United States (U.S). Although the models were parameterized based on U.S. aquifers, findings from this study are applicable elsewhere that have mean recharge rates between 3.65 and 730 mm yr(-1). We find that mean infiltration flux, period of time varying infiltration, and hydraulic conductivity are statistically significant predictors of damping depth. The resulting framework explains why some periodic infiltration fluxes associated with climate variability dampen with depth in the vadose zone, resulting in steady-state recharge, while other periodic surface fluxes do not dampen with depth, resulting in transient recharge. We find that transient recharge in response to the climate variability patterns could be detected at the depths of water levels in most U.S. aquifers. Our findings indicate that the damping behavior of transient infiltration fluxes is linear across soil layers for a range of texture combinations. The implications are that relatively simple, homogeneous models of the vadose zone may provide reasonable estimates of the damping depth of climate-varying transient recharge in some complex, layered vadose zone profiles.

AB Groundwater recharge (GR) controls vegetation, geomorphology, groundwater, wetlands and surface flow, and ultimately, the ecology and economics of semi-arid regions. Therefore, it is critical to assess hydroclimate model scenarios and the uncertainty in future GR to force regional groundwater models. We use basic statistics of downscaled Global Circulation Model (GCM)-projected cumulative potential GR (GR(p)) for selecting representative projections. Cumulative GR(p) is the net recharge (difference between precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) rates) over the projection period. The approach is illustrated with an example in the Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH), the largest dune region in the Western Hemisphere, where sandy soils are not conducive to overland flow.
   Changes in decadal-average GR(p) at 1/8 (-12-km) scale were estimated from spatially downscaled, bias-corrected temperature and P output from 16 commonly used GCMs for years 2010 to 2099. These changes accounted for three greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, and projections were subsequently used as input to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface hydrology model. For each of the 48 GCM/VIC hydroclimate projections, cumulative GR(p) was calculated and averaged over the study area. Three projections (those with cumulative average GR(p) nearest the median and 1 standard deviation) were selected as representing Median, Wet and Dry conditions. These projections allow for rapid screening of the sensitivity of regional groundwater models, using readily available downscaled GCM-projected climate changes, thereby optimizing modeling efforts. Future GR(p) was calculated for the NSH using the selected GR projections by adjusting the 2000-2009 baseline GR(p) estimates at 1-km scale. The latter was inferred from a previously calibrated groundwater model, with ET based on remote sensing (MODIS) temperature data, and matching regional baseflows.
   In the NSH by 2099, the Median projection indicates an increase in GR(p) of 3 mm/yr (+5%) relative to the 2000-2009 baseline of 52.6 mm/yr. The Wet projection has an average increase of 22 mm/yr (+42%), and the Dry projection shows an average decrease of 15 mm/yr (-29%), relative to the baseline. Effects of projection period duration and time-step averaging on selection of GR projections with this approach are discussed. The new detailed GR(p) projections clarify varying trends of past large-scale analyses of the Northern High Plains region and indicate the possibility for substantial future changes in the NSH hydrologic system. This approach can be extended to other arid-to-humid regions with available GCM hydro climate projections. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Accurately delineating the effects of hydrological and water quality habitat factors on the aquatic biota will significantly assist the management of water resources and restoration of river ecosystems. However, current models fail to comprehensively consider the effects of multiple habitat factors on the development of fish species. In this study, a dynamic framework for river ecosystems was set up to explore the effects of multiple habitat factors in terms of hydrology and water quality on the fish community in rivers. To achieve this the biomechanical forms of the relationships between hydrology, water quality, and aquatic organisms were determined. The developing processes of the food web without external disturbance were simulated by 208 models, constructed using Ecopath With Ecosim (EWE). These models were then used to analyze changes in biomass (Delta B) of two representative fish species, Opsariichthys bidens and Carassius auratus, which are widely distributed in Asia, and thus have attracted the attention of scholars and stakeholders, due to the consequence of habitat alteration. Results showed that the relationship between the changes in fish biomass and key habitat factors can be expressed in a unified form. T-tests for the unified form revealed that the means of the two data sets of simulated and observed Delta B for these two fish species (O. bidens and C. auratus) were equal at the significance level of 5%. Compared with other ecological dynamic models, our framework includes theories that are easy to understand and has modest requirements for assembly and scientific expertise. Moreover, this framework can objectively assess the influence of hydrological and water quality variance on aquatic biota with simpler theory and little expertise. Therefore, it is easy to be put into practice and can provide a scientific support for decisions in ecological restoration made by river administrators and stakeholders across the world.

AB The need for predictions of flow time-series persists at ungauged catchments, motivating the research goals of our study. By means of the Sacramento model, this paper explores the use of parameter transfer within homogeneous regions of similar climate and flow characteristics and makes comparisons with predictions from a priori parameters. We assessed the performance using the Nash-Sutcliffe (NS), bias, mean monthly hydrograph and flow duration curve (FDC). The study was conducted on a large dataset of 73 catchments within the eastern US. Two approaches to the parameter transferability were developed and evaluated; (i) the within homogeneous region parameter transfer using one donor catchment specific to each region, (ii) the parameter transfer disregarding the geographical limits of homogeneous regions, where one donor catchment was common to all regions. Comparisons between both parameter transfers enabled to assess the gain in performance from the parameter regionalization and its respective constraints and limitations. The parameter transfer within homogeneous regions outperformed the a priori parameters and led to a decrease in bias and increase in efficiency reaching a median NS of 0.77 and a NS of 0.85 at individual catchments. The use of FDC revealed the effect of bias on the inaccuracy of prediction from parameter transfer. In one specific region, of mountainous and forested catchments, the prediction accuracy of the parameter transfer was less satisfactory and equivalent to a priori parameters. In this region, the parameter transfer from the outsider catchment provided the best performance; less-biased with smaller uncertainty in medium flow percentiles (40%-60%). The large disparity of energy conditions explained the lack of performance from parameter transfer in this region. Besides, the subsurface stormflow is predominant and there is a likelihood of lateral preferential flow, which according to its specific properties further explained the reduced efficiency. Testing the parameter transferability using criteria of similar climate and flow characteristics at ungauged catchments and comparisons with predictions from a priori parameters are a novelty. The ultimate limitations of both approaches are recognized and recommendations are made for future research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Traditional flood risk analysis focuses on the probability of flood events exceeding the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures while neglecting the influence of sedimentation in river channels on regional flood control systems. This work advances traditional flood risk analysis by proposing a univariate and copula-based bivariate hydrological risk framework which incorporates both flood control and sediment transport. In developing the framework, the conditional probabilities of different flood events under various extreme precipitation scenarios are estimated by exploiting the copula-based model. Moreover, a Monte Carlo-based algorithm is designed to quantify the sampling uncertainty associated with univariate and bivariate hydrological risk analyses. Two catchments located on the Loess plateau are selected as study regions: the upper catchments of the Xianyang and Huaxian stations (denoted as UCX and UCH, respectively). The univariate and bivariate return periods, risk and reliability in the context of uncertainty for the purposes of flood control and sediment transport are assessed for the study regions. The results indicate that sedimentation triggers higher risks of damaging the safety of local flood control systems compared with the event that AMF exceeds the design flood of downstream hydraulic structures in the UCX and UCH. Moreover, there is considerable sampling uncertainty affecting the univariate and bivariate hydrologic risk evaluation, which greatly challenges measures of future flood mitigation. In addition, results also confirm that the developed framework can estimate conditional probabilities associated with different flood events under various extreme precipitation scenarios aiming for flood control and sediment transport. The proposed hydrological risk framework offers a promising technical reference for flood risk analysis in sandy regions worldwide. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urban road surface roughness is one of the most important factors in estimation of surface runoff loads caused by road-deposited sediment (RDS) wash-off and design of its control measures. However, because of a lack of experimental data to distinguish the role of surface roughness, the effects of surface roughness on RDS accumulation and release are not clear. In this study, paired asphalt and concrete road surfaces and rainfall simulation designs were used to distinguish the role of surface roughness in RDS build-up and wash-off. Our results showed that typical asphalt surfaces often have higher depression depths than typical concrete surfaces, indicating that asphalt surfaces are relatively rougher than concrete surface. Asphalt surfaces can retain a larger RDS amount, relative higher percentage of coarser particles, larger RDS wash-off loads, and lower wash-off percentage, than concrete surfaces. Surface roughness has different effects in RDS motilities with different particle sizes during rainfall runoff, and the settleable particles (44-149 mu m) were notably influenced by it. Furthermore, the first flush phenomenon tended to be greater on relatively smooth surfaces than relatively rough surfaces. Overall, surface roughness plays an important role in influencing the complete process of RDS build-up and wash-off on different road characteristics. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The genetic algorithm (GA) was combined with the Conversion of Land Use and its Effect at Small regional extent (CLUE-S) model to obtain an optimized land use pattern for controlling non-point source (NPS) pollution. The performance of the combination was evaluated. The effect of the optimized land use pattern on the NPS pollution control was estimated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model and an assistant map was drawn to support the land use plan for the future. The Xiangxi River watershed was selected as the study area. Two scenarios were used to simulate the land use change. Under the historical trend scenario (Markov chain prediction), the forest area decreased by 2035.06 ha, and was mainly converted into paddy and dryland area. In contrast, under the optimized scenario (genetic algorithm (GA) prediction), up to 3370 ha of dryland area was converted into forest area. Spatially, the conversion of paddy and dryland into forest occurred mainly in the northwest and southeast of the watershed, where the slope land occupied a large proportion. The organic and inorganic phosphorus loads decreased by 3.6% and 3.7%, respectively, in the optimized scenario compared to those in the historical trend scenario. GA showed a better performance in optimized land use prediction. A comparison of the land use patterns in 2010 under the real situation and in 2020 under the optimized situation showed that Shennongjia and Shuiyuesi should convert 1201.76 ha and 1115.33 ha of dryland into forest areas, respectively, which represented the greatest changes in all regions in the watershed. The results of this study indicated that GA and the CLUE-S model can be used to optimize the land use patterns in the future and that SWAT can be used to evaluate the effect of land use optimization on non-point source pollution control. These methods may provide support for land use plan of an area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A common assumption in phosphorus (P) load apportionment studies is that P loads in rivers consist of flow independent point source emissions (mainly from domestic and industrial origins) and flow dependent diffuse source emissions (mainly from agricultural origin). Hence, rivers dominated by point sources will exhibit highest P concentration during low-flow, when flow dilution capacity is minimal, whereas rivers dominated by diffuse sources will exhibit highest P concentration during high flow, when land-to-river hydrological connectivity is maximal. Here, we show that Soluble Reactive P (SRP) concentrations in three forested catchments free of point sources exhibited seasonal maxima during the summer low-flow period, i.e. a pattern expected in point source dominated areas. A load apportionment model (LAM) is used to show how point sources contribution may have been overestimated in previous studies, because of a biogeochemical process mimicking a point source signal. Almost twenty-two years (March 1995-September 2016) of monthly monitoring data of SRP, dissolved iron (Fe) and nitrate-N (NO3) were used to investigate the underlying mechanisms: SRP and Fe exhibited similar seasonal patterns and opposite to that of NO3. We hypothesise that Fe oxyhydroxide reductive dissolution might be the cause of SRP release during the summer period, and that NO3 might act as a redox buffer, controlling the seasonality of SRP release. We conclude that LAMS may overestimate the contribution of P point sources, especially during the summer low-flow period, when eutrophication risk is maximal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Urban runoff negatively impacts the receiving streams and different solutions have been proposed in literature to limit the effect of urbanization on the water balance. These solutions suggest to manage urban runoff in order to switch from a post-development river hydrograph (high peak and short duration) back again to a pre-development hydrograph (low peak and high duration). Combined sewer overflows (CSOs) represent severe pollutant sources for receiving streams due to the combination of first flush of roads and sewers and black water conveyed by combined sewer systems. Constructed wetlands for CSO treatment (CSO-CWs) are adopted with increasing frequency for reducing pollutant inputs to streams. Moreover, these systems exhibit the characteristic to behave similarly to ponds, wetlands, and bioretention systems that provide flood mitigation by decreasing the intensity of peak flows. This work aims to show the additional ecosystem service provided by CSO-CWs in term of limitation of the hydraulic impact of CSO on stream hydrograph. A mathematical model is developed to simulate the hydraulic behavior of a real case study situated in Gorla Maggiore (Italy), which includes vertical flow subsurface beds (VF) as first stage and a free water surface bed (FWS) as second stage. The model simulates the unsaturated flow within VF and the accumulation of water on the top of VF and within FWS. Results show a satisfactory lamination performance of the system for both single and up to 5 consecutive flood events, with a peak flow reduction ranging from 52.7% to 95.4%. Withdrawn of flow rate from the river in order to cope with long dry period does not significantly affect the lamination performances. The considered CSO-CW exhibits an excellent lamination efficiency also during more intense floods events, with a peak flow reduction of 86.2% for a CSO event with return period of 10 years. The flow rate frequency density function determined by the CSO-CW is more shifted towards lower values compared to untreated CSOs. These results indicate that CSO-CWs work properly in terms of reduction of CSO urbanization impact on stream hydrology. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall erosivity is an index that describes the power of rainfall to cause soil erosion and it is used around the world for assessing and predicting soil loss on agricultural lands. Erosivity can be represented in terms of both rainfall momentum and kinetic energy, both calculated per unit time and area. Contrasting results on the representativeness of these two variables are available: some authors stated that momentum and kinetic energy are practically interchangeable in soil loss estimation while other found that kinetic energy is the most suitable expression of rainfall erosivity. The direct and continuous measurements of momentum and kinetic energy by a disdrometer allow also to establish a relationship with rainfall intensity at the study site.
   At first in this paper a comparison between the momentum-rainfall intensity relationships measured at Palermo and El Teularet by an optical disdrometer is presented. For a fixed rainfall intensity the measurements showed that the rainfall momentum values measured at the two experimental sites are not coincident. However both datasets presented a threshold value of rainfall intensity over which the rainfall momentum assumes a quasi-constant value. Then the reliability of a theoretically deduced relationship, linking momentum, rainfall intensity and median volume diameter, is positively verified using measured raindrop size distributions. An analysis to assess which variable, momentum or kinetic energy per unit area and time, is the best predictor of erosivity in Italy and Spain was also carried out. This investigation highlighted that the rainfall kinetic energy per unit area and time can be substituted by rainfall momentum as index for estimating the rainfall erosivity, and this result does not depend on the site where precipitation occurs.
   Finally, rainfall intensity measurements and soil loss data collected from the bare plots equipped at Sparacia experimental area were used to verify the reliability of some rainfall erosivity indices and their ability to distinguish the type of involved soil erosion processes.

AB We used an Optimal Interpolation (OI) scheme to generate a reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) grid, forcing meteorological variables, and their respective error variance in the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1989-2011. To perform the OI we used observational data from the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET) and outputs from a physically-based climate model. To compute ETo we used five OI schemes to generate grids for the five observed climate variables necessary to compute ETo using the FAO-recommended form of the Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-PM). The granularity of the resulting grids are less sensitive to variations in the density and distribution of the observational network than those generated by other interpolation methods. This is because our implementation of the OI method uses a physically-based climate model as prior background information about the spatial distribution of the climatic variables, which is critical for under-observed regions. This provides temporal consistency in the spatial variability of the climatic fields. We also show that increases in the density and improvements in the distribution of the observational network reduces substantially the uncertainty of the climatic and EL estimates. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of observational uncertainties and network densification suggests the existence of a trade-off between quantity and quality of observations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Urbanization-induced landuse changes alter runoff regimes in complex ways. In this study, a detailed investigation of the urbanization impacts on runoff regimes is provided by using multiple runoff metrics and with consideration of landuse dynamics. A catchment hydrological model is modified by coupling a simplified flow routing module of the urban drainage system and landuse dynamics to improve longterm urban runoff simulations. Moreover, multivariate statistical approach is adopted to mine the spatial variations of runoff metrics so as to further identify critical impact factors of landuse changes. The Qing River catchment as a peri-urban catchment in the Beijing metropolitan area is selected as our study region. Results show that: (1) the dryland agriculture is decreased from 13.9% to 1.5% of the total catchment area in the years 2000-2015, while the percentages of impervious surface, forest and grass are increased from 63.5% to 72.4%, 13.5% to 16.6% and 5.1% to 6.5%, respectively. The most dramatic landuse changes occur in the middle and downstream regions; (2) The combined landuse changes do not alter the average flow metrics obviously at the catchment outlet, but slightly increase the high flow metrics, particularly the extreme high flows; (3) The impacts on runoff metrics in the sub-catchments are more obvious than those at the catchment outlet. For the average flow metrics, the most impacted metric is the runoff depth in the dry season (October similar to May) with a relative change from -10.9% to 11.6%, and the critical impact factors are the impervious surface and grass. For the high flow metrics, the extreme high flow depth is increased most significantly with a relative change from -0.6% to 10.5%, and the critical impact factors are the impervious surface and dryland agriculture; (4) The runoff depth metrics in the sub-catchments are increased because of the landuse changes from dryland agriculture to impervious surface, but are decreased because of the landuse changes from dryland agriculture or impervious surface to grass or forest. The results of this study provide useful information for urban planning such as Sponge City design. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated temporal variations and vertical evolution of dissolved gaseous tracers (CFC-11, CFC-12, SF6, and noble gases), as well as H-3/He-3 ratio to determine groundwater recharge processes of a shallow unconfined, hard-rock aquifer in an agricultural catchment. We sampled dissolved gas concentration at 4 locations along the hillslope of a small experimental watershed, over 6 hydrological years, between 2 and 6 times per years, for a total of 20 field campaigns. We collected groundwater samples in the fluctuation zone and the permanently saturated zone using piezometers from 5 to 20 m deep. The purpose of this work is i) to assess the benefits of using gaseous tracers like CFCs and SF6 to study very young groundwater with flows suspected to be heterogeneous and variable in time, ii) to characterize the processes that control dissolved gas concentrations in groundwater during the recharge of the aquifer, and iii) to understand the evolution of recharge flow processes by repeated measurement campaigns, taking advantage of a long monitoring in a site devoted to recharge processes investigation.
   Gas tracer profiles are compared at different location of the catchment and for different hydrologic conditions. In addition, we compare results from CFCs and H-3/He-3 analysis to define the flow model that best explains tracer concentrations. Then we discuss the influence of recharge events on tracer concentrations and residence time and propose a temporal evolution of residence times for the unsaturated zone and the permanently saturated zone. These results are used to gain a better understanding of the conceptual model of the catchment and flow processes especially during recharge events. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Arsenic (As)-contaminated groundwater is a global concern with potential detrimental effects on the health of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. However, the extent of this problem may be more severe than anticipated, as many wells have not been tested and may contain unsafe-level of As. An optimized statistical regression model was developed to predict the probability of geogenic high As groundwater (As > 10 mu g/L) in this study. Easily obtained hydrogeochemical and geological parameters that are significantly related to As geochemical behaviors were selected as explanatory variables in the model. The results indicate that pH, Cl-, HCO3-, SO42-, and NO3- concentrations, stratigraphic information, and well depth are excellent predictors of As exposure in the Datong Basin, China. Predicted unsafe wells correspond well with the known distribution of high As groundwater in the Datong Basin. The successful application of a data set from Bangladesh also demonstrated the applicability and credibility of this proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urmia Lake, once the second largest saline lake in the world, is on the verge of complete desiccation. It has been suggested that the desiccation is caused by intensified human activities, especially irrigation, and prolonged droughts in the lake basin, but there is a lack of quantitative analysis to attribute the observed water level decline to natural and anthropogenic causes. In this study, we use remote sensing data, ground observations, and a hydrological model with human impact assessment capabilities (HiGW-MAT) to investigate the natural and human-induced changes in the hydrology of Urmia Lake basin from 1980 to 2010. Based on the analysis of remote sensing data, we find a similar to 98% and similar to 180% increase in agricultural lands and urban areas, respectively, from 1987 through 2016, with a corresponding shrinkage in lake area by similar to 86%. Further, we use model results to examine the changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) over the basin including the lake. Results indicate that TWS declined over the lake region and the lake lost water at a faster rate than the watershed did. Comparison of river inflow to the lake from two simulations-one with and the other without human activities-suggests that human water management activities caused a reduction in streamfiow of similar to 1.74 km(3)/year from 1995 to 2010, which accounts for similar to 86% of the total depletion in lake volume during the same period. It is also found that irrigation water requirement almost tripled, causing high withdrawals from rivers. These results demonstrate that the on-going depletion of Urmia Lake is not solely due to prolonged droughts but also due to direct anthropogenic alterations which caused significant changes in land use, streamflow, and water storage within the basin. This study provides important insights on the natural and human-induced changes in the hydrology of Urmia Lake and highlights the need for a high resolution regional scale modeling approach for better understanding potential future changes toward restoring the lake and putting forth a course of action to stop further desiccation and avoid a major environmental catastrophe.

AB The Fertile Crescent (FC) region comprises the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula. The FC suffered two severe drought episodes separated by a 7-year period, in 1998-2000 and 2007-2009, which are considered the most severe episodes to hit the region in the last 50 years. A Lagrangian model (FLEXPART) and ERA-Interim data (with a 1 degrees x 1 degrees lat-long resolution) were used to identify for the first time the climatological sources of moisture for the FC and their characteristics. Variability and the source-receptor relationships, concerning their contribution to the precipitation, and the implications regarding the transport of moisture changes over the FC, during the wet season (October-May) from 1980 to 2014 were analysed. The main climatological moisture sources during this period were determined to be the FC itself, the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Arabian Sea, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the central and western parts of the Mediterranean Sea.
   The analysis showed higher anomalous conditions in the moisture transport from some moisture sources during the two outstanding drought episodes. The key feature of the wet seasons during these episodes was a deficit in the moisture losses over the studied area related to the FC itself, the Red and Arabian Seas sources, followed and to a lesser extent by the eastern Mediterranean Sea over the northern part of the FC region. Nevertheless, the moisture supply deficit from the sources was much greater during the 2007-2009 drought event. The SPEI index at large scales (24 months) showed that the 2007-2009 episode was part of longer-term drought conditions that had been developing over the previous months, reinforcing the drought severity given recycling processes attributed to the FC. During the two extreme drought episodes, the mountainous terrain over the northern and eastern FC suffered the highest precipitation deficits, and these areas are, precisely, the most influenced by two of the major moisture sources, namely, the FC and eastern Mediterranean Sea. The decreased moisture contribution from these main sources led to more intense droughts over the region. As a result, both regions should be considered as hotspots to signal severe or extreme droughts in the region. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With ignorance and potential surprise dominating decision making in water resources, a framework for dealing with such uncertainty is a critical need in hydrology. We operationalize the 'potential surprise' criterion proposed by Shackle, Vickers, and Katzner (SVK) to derive decision rules to manage water resources under uncertainty and ignorance. We apply this framework to managing water supply systems in Bangladesh that face severe, naturally occurring arsenic contamination. The uncertainty involved with arsenic in water supplies makes the application of conventional analysis of decision-making ineffective. Given the uncertainty and surprise involved in such cases, we find that optimal decisions tend to favor actions that avoid irreversible outcomes instead of conventional cost-effective actions. We observe that a diversification of the water supply system also emerges as a robust strategy to avert unintended outcomes of water contamination. Shallow wells had a slight higher optimal level (36%) compare to deep wells and surface treatment which had allocation levels of roughly 32% under each. The approach can be applied in a variety of other cases that involve decision making under uncertainty and surprise, a frequent situation in natural resources management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Abrupt changes are an important manifestation of hydrological variability. How to accurately detect the abrupt changes in hydrological time series and evaluate their significance is an important issue, but methods for dealing with them effectively are lacking. In this study, we propose an approach to evaluate the significance of abrupt changes in time series at five levels: no, weak, moderate, strong, and dramatic. The approach was based on an index of correlation coefficient calculated for the original time series and its abrupt change component. A bigger value of correlation coefficient reflects a higher significance level of abrupt change. Results of Monte-Carlo experiments verified the reliability of the proposed approach, and also indicated the great influence of statistical characteristics of time series on the significance level of abrupt change. The approach was derived from the relationship between correlation coefficient index and abrupt change, and can estimate and grade the significance levels of abrupt changes in hydrological time series.
   Application of the proposed approach to ten major watersheds in China showed that abrupt changes mainly occurred in five watersheds in northern China, which have arid or semi-arid climate and severe shortages of water resources. Runoff processes in northern China were more sensitive to precipitation change than those in southern China. Although annual precipitation and surface water resources amount (SWRA) exhibited a harmonious relationship in most watersheds, abrupt changes in the latter were more significant. Compared with abrupt changes in annual precipitation, human activities contributed much more to the abrupt changes in the corresponding SWRA, except for the Northwest Inland River watershed.

AB Intense precipitation events in the Mediterranean often lead to devastating flash floods (FF). FF modelling is affected by several kinds of uncertainties and Hydrological Ensemble Prediction Systems (HEPS) are designed to take those uncertainties into account. The major source of uncertainty comes from rainfall forcing and convective-scale meteorological ensemble prediction systems can manage it for forecasting purpose. But other sources are related to the hydrological modelling part of the HEPS. This study focuses on the uncertainties arising from the hydrological model parameters and initial soil moisture with aim to design an ensemble-based version of an hydrological model dedicated to Mediterranean fast responding rivers simulations, the ISBA-TOP coupled system. The first step consists in identifying the parameters that have the strongest influence on FF simulations by assuming perfect precipitation. A sensitivity study is carried out first using a synthetic framework and then for several real events and several catchments. Perturbation methods varying the most sensitive parameters as well as initial soil moisture allow designing an ensemble-based version of ISBA-TOP. The first results of this system on some real events are presented. The direct perspective of this work will be to drive this ensemble-based version with the members of a convective-scale meteorological ensemble prediction system to design a complete HEPS for FF forecasting.

AB Elevated levels of selenium (Se) in aqueous environments can harm aquatic life and endanger livestock and human health. Although Se occurs naturally in the rocks and soils of many alluvial aquifers, mining and agricultural activities can increase its rate of mobilization and transport to surface waters. Attention is given here to regions where nonpoint source return flows from irrigated lands carry pollutant loads to aquifers and streams, contributing to concentrations that violate regulatory and performance standards. Of particular concern is the heightened level and mobilization of Se influenced by nitrate (NO3), a harmful pollutant in its own right. We present a numerical model that simulates the reactive transport of Se and nitrogen (N) species in a coupled groundwater-surface water system. Building upon a conceptual model that incorporates the major processes affecting Se and NO3 transport in an irrigated watershed, the model links the finite-difference models MODFLOW, UZF-RT3D, and OTIS, to simulate flow and reactive transport of multiple chemical species in both the aquifer and a stream network, with mass exchange between the two. The capability of the new model is showcased by calibration, testing, and application to a 500 km(2) region in Colorado's Lower Arkansas River Valley using a rich data set gathered over a 10-yr period. Simulation of spatial and temporal distributions of Se concentration reveals conditions that exceed standards in groundwater for approximately 20% of the area. For the Arkansas River, standards are exceeded by 290%-450%. Simulation indicates that river concentrations of NO3 alone are near the current interim standard for the total of all dissolved N species. These results indicate the need for future use of the developed model to investigate the prospects for land and water best management practices to decrease pollutant levels. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The widely used design storms in urban drainage networks has different drawbacks. One of them is that the shape of the rainfall temporal pattern is fixed regardless of climate change. However, previous studies have shown that the temporal pattern may scale with temperature due to climate change, which consequently affects peak flow. Thus, in addition to the scaling of the rainfall volume, the scaling relationship for the rainfall temporal pattern with temperature needs to be investigated by deriving the scaling values for each fraction within storm events, which is lacking in many parts of the world including the UK. Therefore, this study analysed rainfall data from 28 gauges close to the study area with a 15-min resolution as well as the daily temperature data. It was found that, at warmer temperatures, the rainfall temporal pattern becomes less uniform, with more intensive peak rainfall during higher intensive times and weaker rainfall during less intensive times. This is the case for storms with and without seasonal separations. In addition, the scaling values for both the rainfall volume and the rainfall fractions (i.e. each segment of rainfall temporal pattern) for the summer season were found to be higher than the corresponding results for the winter season. Applying the derived scaling values for the temporal pattern of the summer season in a hydrodynamic sewer network model produced high percentage change of peak flow between the current and future climate. This study on the scaling of rainfall fractions is the first in the UK, and its findings are of importance to modellers and designers of sewer systems because it can provide more robust scenarios for flooding mitigation in urban areas.

AB Sediment cores from aquatic environments can provide valuable information about historical pollution levels and sources. However, there is little understanding of the uncertainties associated with these findings. The aim of this study is to fill this knowledge gap by proposing a framework for quantifying the uncertainties in historical heavy metal pollution records reconstructed from sediment cores. This uncertainty framework consists of six sources of uncertainty: uncertainties in (1) metals analysis methods, (2) spatial variability of sediment core heavy metal profiles, (3) sub-sampling intervals, (4) the sediment chronology, (5) the assumption that metal levels in bed sediments reflect the magnitude of metal inputs into the aquatic system, and (6) post-depositional transformation of metals. We apply this uncertainty framework to an urban floodplain lake in South-East Australia (Willsmere Billabong). We find that for this site, uncertainties in historical dated heavy metal profiles can be up to 176%, largely due to uncertainties in the sediment chronology, and in the assumption that the settled heavy metal mass is equivalent to the heavy metal mass entering the aquatic system. As such, we recommend that future studies reconstructing historical pollution records using sediment cores from aquatic systems undertake an investigation of the uncertainties in the reconstructed pollution record, using the uncertainty framework provided in this study. We envisage that quantifying and understanding the uncertainties associated with the reconstructed pollution records will facilitate the practical application of sediment core heavy metal profiles in environmental management projects.

AB In a semi-arid to arid climate context, dependency on groundwater resources may lead to overexploitation and deterioration of water quality. The Continental Intercalaire (CI) aquifer is one such continentalscale aquifer (more than a million of km(2)), which is mainly confined, poorly recharged but intensely abstracted. To date, the management of this resource relies on hydrogeological modelling and key parameters such as recharge/discharge rate and groundwater dynamics. We use a combination of residence time indicators (C-14, Cl-36, He-4) and stable isotopes of water (H-2 and O-18) to give greater constraint on the groundwater residence time in the CI. In previous studies, C-14 measurements and steady state modelling indicate a residence time of less than 100 ka whereas in others, Cl-36 measurements and transient scenarios modelling suggest a longer residence time (>500 ka).
   In this study, most of the C-14 measurements are below the limit of detection, establishing residence times greater than 40 ka and confirming the necessity of strict sampling protocols to exclude all air and AMS measurements when low C-14 concentrations are expected.
   In the Tunisian recharge area, detectable C-14 indicate sporadic recharge episodes (3-7 ka and 29-43 ka), whereas He-4 and Cl-36 concentrations in central areas suggest very old (<2 Ma) groundwaters. In these central areas, chlorine concentration can reach more than 2 g/l. Since Cl-36 concentrations are up to 4 time less than the initial input, we are confident there is no excessive deep Cl-36 production.
   We characterise five distinct flowpaths reaching the Tunisian discharge area using their isotopic signatures. According to our mixing model, the average contribution from the main recharge area, the Algerian Atlas Mountains, is around 88%. This value is close to hydrogeological models. Conversely, the contribution from the Dahar Mountains is lower than in the hydrogeological modelling (2% against 10%) whereas the Tinhert shows a greater contribution (10% against 1%).
   Increase of abstraction from the CI can potentially activate the circulation of old brackish groundwaters and dramatically decrease the water quality in the whole system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The nature of epiphreatic flow remains an important research challenge in karst hydrology. This study focuses on the flood propagation along the epiphreatic system of Reka-Timavo system (Kras/Carso Plateau, Slovenia/Italy). It is based on long-term monitoring of basic physical parameters (pressure/level, temperature, specific electric conductivity) of ground water in six active caves belonging to the flow system. The system vigorously responds to flood events, with stage rising >100 m in some of the caves. Besides presenting the response of the system to flood events of different scales, the work focuses on the interpretation of recorded hydrographs in view of the known distribution and size of conduits and basic hydraulic relations. Furthermore, the hydrographs were used to infer the unknown geometry between the observation points. This way, the main flow restrictors, overflow passages and large epiphreatic storages were identified. The assumptions were tested with a hydraulic model, where the inversion procedure was used for an additional parameter optimisation. Time series of temperature and specific electric conductivity were used to assess the apparent velocities of flow between consecutive points. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mobile-immobile transport models can be effective in reproducing heavily tailed breakthrough curves of concentration. However, such models may not adequately describe transport along multiple flow paths with intermediate velocity contrasts in connected fields. We propose using the mobile-mobile model for simulating subsurface flow and associated mixing-controlled reactive transport in connected fields. This model includes two local concentrations, one in the fast- and the other in the slow-flow domain, which predict both the concentration mean and variance. The normalized total concentration variance within the flux is found to be a non-monotonic function of the discharge ratio with a maximum concentration variance at intermediate values of the discharge ratio. We test the mobile-mobile model for mixing-controlled reactive transport with an instantaneous, irreversible bimolecular reaction in structured and connected random heterogeneous domains, and compare the performance of the mobile-mobile to the mobile-immobile model. The results indicate that the mobile-mobile model generally predicts the concentration breakthrough curves (BTCs) of the reactive compound better. Particularly, for cases of an elliptical inclusion with intermediate hydraulic-conductivity contrasts, where the travel-time distribution shows bimodal behavior, the prediction of both the BTCs and maximum product concentration is significantly improved. Our results exemplify that the conceptual model of two mobile domains with diffusive mass transfer in between is in general good for predicting mixing-controlled reactive transport, and particularly so in cases where the transfer in the low-conductivity zones is by slow advection rather than diffusion.

AB Vietnam is a country with diverse terrain and climatic conditions and a dependency on hydropower for a significant proportion of its power needs and as such, is particularly vulnerable to changes in climate. In this paper we apply SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) derived discharge simulation results coupled with regression analysis to estimate the performance of hydropower plants for Vietnam between 1995 and mid-2014 when both power supply and demand increased rapidly. Our approach is to examine the watershed formed from three large inter-boundary basins: The Red River, the Vietnam Coast and the Lower Mekong River, which have a total area of 977,964 km(2). We then divide this area into 7,887 sub-basins with an average area of 131.6 km(2) (based on level 12 of HydroSHEDS/HydroBASINS datasets) and 53,024 Hydrological Response Units (HRUs). Next we simulate river flow for the 40 largest hydropower plants across Vietnam. Our validation process demonstrates that the simulated flows are significantly correlated with the gauged inflows into these dams and are able to serve as a good proxy for the inflows into hydropower dams in our baseline energy regression, which captures 87.7% of the variation in monthly power generation. In other results we estimate that large dams sacrifice on average around 18.2% of their contemporaneous production for the purpose of flood control. When we assess Vietnam's current alignment of dams we find that the current cascades of large hydropower dams appear to be reasonably efficient: each MWh/day increase in upstream generation adds 0.146 MWh/day to downstream generation. The study provides evidence for the multiple benefits of a national system of large hydropower dams using a cascade design. Such a system may help overcome future adverse impacts from changes in climate conditions. However, our results show that there is still room for improvement in the harmonization of cascades in some basins. Finally, possible adverse hydro-ecological impacts due to the proliferation of large upstream dams, including those located beyond Vietnam's border, need to be carefully considered.

AB Data assimilation techniques such as the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) are often applied to hydrological models with minimal state volume/capacity constraints enforced during ensemble generation. Flux constraints are rarely, if ever, applied. Consequently, model states can be adjusted beyond physically reasonable limits, compromising the integrity of model output. In this paper, we investigate the effect of constraining the EnKF on forecast performance. A "free run" in which no assimilation is applied is compared to a completely unconstrained EnKF implementation, a 'typical' hydrological implementation (in which mass constraints are enforced to ensure non-negativity and capacity thresholds of model states are not exceeded), and then to a more tightly constrained implementation where flux as well as mass constraints are imposed to force the rate of water movement to/from ensemble states to be within physically consistent boundaries. A three year period (2008-2010) was selected from the available data record (1976-2010). This was specifically chosen as it had no significant data gaps and represented well the range of flows observed in the longer dataset. Over this period, the standard implementation of the EnKF (no constraints) contained eight hydrological events where (multiple) physically inconsistent state adjustments were made. All were selected for analysis. Mass constraints alone did little to improve forecast performance; in fact, several were significantly degraded compared to the free run. In contrast, the combined use of mass and flux constraints significantly improved forecast performance in six events relative to all other implementations, while the remaining two events showed no significant difference in performance. Placing flux as well as mass constraints on the data assimilation framework encourages physically consistent state estimation and results in more accurate and reliable forward predictions of streamflow for robust decision-making. We also experiment with the observation error, which has a profound effect on filter performance. We note an interesting tension exists between specifying an error which reflects known uncertainties and errors in the measurement versus an error that allows "optimal" filter updating.

AB Hydrological processes regulating sediment transport from land to sea have been widely studied. However, anthropogenic factors controlling the river flow-sediment regime and subsequent response of the estuary are still poorly understood. Here we conducted a multi-timescale analysis on flow and sediment discharges during the period 1967-2014 for the two tributaries of the Jiulong River in Southeast China. The long-term flow-sediment relationship remained linear in the North River throughout the period, while the linearity showed a remarkable change after 1995 in the West River, largely due to construction of dams and reservoirs in the upland watershed. Over short timescales, rainstorm events caused the changes of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in the rivers. Regression analysis using synchronous SSC data in a wet season (2009) revealed a delayed response (average 5 days) of the estuary to river input, and a box-model analysis established a quantitative relationship to further describe the response of the estuary to the river sediment input over multiple timescales. The short-term response is determined by both the vertical SSC-salinity changes and the sediment trapping rate in the estuary. However, over the long term, the reduction of riverine sediment yield increased marine sediments trapped into the estuary. The results of this study indicate that human activities (e.g., dams) have substantially altered sediment delivery patterns and river-estuary interactions at multiple timescales.

AB Groundwater and surface-water interactions are regulated by catchment characteristics and complex inter- and intra-annual variations in climatic conditions that are not yet fully understood. Our objective was to investigate the influence of catchment characteristics and freeze-thaw processes on surface and groundwater interactions in a boreal landscape, the Krycklan catchment in Sweden. We used a numerical modelling approach and sub-catchment evaluation method to identify and evaluate fundamental catchment characteristics and processes. The model reproduced observed stream discharge patterns of the 14 sub-catchments and the dynamics of the 15 groundwater wells with an average accumulated discharge error of 1% (15% standard deviation) and an average groundwater-level mean error of 0.1 m (0.23 m standard deviation). We show how peatland characteristics dampen the effect of intense rain, and how soil freeze-thaw processes regulate surface and groundwater partitioning during snowmelt. With these results, we demonstrate the importance of defining, understanding and quantifying the role of landscape heterogeneity and sub-catchment characteristics for accurately representing catchment hydrological functioning.

AB Thawing permafrost on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) has great impacts on the local hydrological process by way of causing ground ice to thaw. Until now there is little knowledge on ground ice hydrology near permafrost table under a warming climate. This study applied stable tracers (isotopes and chloride) and hydrograph separation model to quantify the sources of ground ice near permafrost table in continuous permafrost regions of the central QTP. The results indicated that the ground ice near permafrost table was mainly supplied by active layer water and permafrost water, accounting for 58.9 to 87.0% and 13.0 to 41.1%, respectively, which implying that the active layer was the dominant source. The contribution rates from the active layer to the ground ice in alpine meadow (59 to 69%) was less than that in alpine steppe (70 to 87%). It showed well-developed hydrogeochemical depth gradients, presenting depleted isotopes and positive chemical gradients with depth within the soil layer. The effects of evaporation and freeze-out fractionation on the soil water and ground ice were evident. The results provide additional insights into ground ice sources and cycling near permafrost table in permafrost terrain, and would be helpful for improving process-based detailed hydrologic models under the occurring global warming.

AB Quantifying flow in rivers is fundamental to assessments of water supply, water quality, ecological conditions, hydrological responses to storm events, and geomorphological processes. Image-based surface velocity measurements have shown promise in extending the range of discharge conditions that can be measured in the field. The use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) in image-based measurements of surface velocities has the potential to expand applications of this method. Thus far, few investigations have assessed this potential by evaluating the accuracy and repeatability of discharge measurements using surface velocities obtained from UAS. This study uses large-scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV) derived from videos captured by cameras on a UAS and a fixed tripod to obtain discharge measurements at ten different stream locations in Illinois, USA. Discharge values are compared to reference values measured by an acoustic Doppler current profiler, a propeller meter, and established stream gauges. The results demonstrate the effects of UAS flight height, camera steadiness and leveling accuracy, video sampling frequency, and LSPIV interrogation area size on surface velocities, and show that the mean difference between fixed and UAS cameras is less than 10%. Differences between LSPIV-derived and reference discharge values are generally less than 20%, not systematically low or high, and not related to site parameters like channel width or depth, indicating that results are relatively insensitive to camera setup and image processing parameters typically required of LSPIV. The results also show that standard velocity indices (between 0.85 and 0.9) recommended for converting surface velocities to depth-averaged velocities yield reasonable discharge estimates, but are best calibrated at specific sites. The study recommends a basic methodology for LSPIV discharge measurements using UAS that is rapid, cost-efficient, and does not require major preparatory work at a measurement location, pre- and post-processing of imagery, or extensive background in image analysis and PIV.

AB Streamflow and sediment loads undergo remarkable changes in worldwide rivers in response to climatic changes and human interferences. Understanding their variability and the causes is of vital importance regarding river management. With respect to the Changjiang River (CJR), one of the largest river systems on earth, we provide a comprehensive overview of its hydrological regime changes by analyzing long time series of river discharges and sediment loads data at multiple gauge stations in the basin downstream of Three Gorges Dam (TGD). We find profound river discharge reduction during flood peaks and in the wet-to-dry transition period, and slightly increased discharges in the dry season. Sediment loads have reduced progressively since 1980s owing to sediment yield reduction and dams in the upper basin, with notably accelerated reduction since the start of TGD operation in 2003. Channel degradation occurs in downstream river, leading to considerable river stage drop. Lowered river stages have caused a 'draining effect' on lakes by fostering lake outflows following TGD impoundments. The altered river-lake interplay hastens low water occurrence inside the lakes which can worsen the drought given shrinking lake sizes in long-term. Moreover, lake sedimentation has decreased since 2002 with less sediment trapped in and more sediment flushed out of the lakes. These hydrological changes have broad impacts on river flood and drought occurrences, water security, fluvial ecosystem, and delta safety. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new framework model is presented in this study for sharing of water in a river basin using certain governing variables, in an effort to enhance the objectivity for a reasonable and equitable allocation of water among co-basin states. The governing variables were normalised to reduce the governing variables of different co-basin states of a river basin on same scale. In the absence of objective methods for evaluating the weights to be assigned to co-basin states for water allocation, a framework was conceptualised and formulated to determine the normalised weighting factors of different co-basin states as a function of the governing variables. The water allocation to any co-basin state had been assumed to be proportional to its struggle for equity, which in turn was assumed to be a function of the normalised discontent, satisfaction, and weighting factors of each co-basin state. System dynamics was used effectively to represent and solve the proposed model formulation. The proposed model was successfully applied to the Vamsadhara river basin located in the South-Eastern part of India, and a sensitivity analysis of the proposed model parameters was carried out to prove its robustness in terms of the proposed model convergence and validity over the broad spectrum values of the proposed model parameters. The solution converged quickly to a final allocation of 1444 million cubic metre (MCM) in the case of the Odisha co-basin state, and to 1067 MCM for the Andhra Pradesh co-basin state. The sensitivity analysis showed that the proposed model's allocation varied from 1584 MCM to 1336 MCM for Odisha state and from 927 to 1175 MCM for Andhra, depending upon the importance weights given to the governing variables for the calculation of the weighting factors. Thus, the proposed model was found to be very flexible to explore various policy options to arrive at a decision in a water sharing problem. It can therefore be effectively applied to any trans-boundary problem where there is conflict about water-sharing among co-basin states. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The Nile Delta is essential to Egypt's agro- and socio-economy. Although surface water is the traditional source for Egypt's irrigation, the shallow fresh groundwater resources underlying the delta are increasingly burdened by groundwater pumping, which increases interest in the status of the groundwater resources. Groundwater up to three times more saline than sea water was found at 600 m depth. The occurrence of this hypersaline groundwater raises doubts on the often-made assumption in the literature that seawater is the only source of salt in the Nile Delta aquifer and makes further investigation necessary. Knowledge on the origin of this hypersaline groundwater is key in assessing the possibility of deep fresh groundwater pockets. In this paper we conducted computational analyses to assess possible origins using both analytical solutions and numerical models. It is concluded that the hypersaline groundwater can either originate from Quaternary free convection systems, or from compaction-induced upward salt transport of hypersaline groundwater that formed during the Messinian salinity crisis. Our results also indicate that with groundwater dating it is possible to discriminate between these two hypotheses. Furthermore, it is deduced that the hydrological connection between aquifer and sea is crucial to the hydrogeological functioning of the Nile Delta Aquifer. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

AB Bias correction is usually implemented prior to using climate model outputs for impact studies. However, bias correction methods that are commonly used treat climate variables independently and often ignore inter-variable dependencies. The effects of ignoring such dependencies on impact studies need to be investigated. This study aims to assess the impacts of correcting the inter-variable correlation of climate model outputs on hydrological modeling. To this end, a joint bias correction (JBC) method which corrects the joint distribution of two variables as a whole is compared with an independent bias correction (IBC) method; this is considered in terms of correcting simulations of precipitation and temperature from 26 climate models for hydrological modeling over 12 watersheds located in various climate regimes. The results show that the simulated precipitation and temperature are considerably biased not only in the individual distributions, but also in their correlations, which in turn result in biased hydrological simulations. In addition to reducing the biases of the individual characteristics of precipitation and temperature, the JBC method can also reduce the bias in precipitation-temperature (P-T) correlations. In terms of hydrological modeling, the JBC method performs significantly better than the IBC method for 11 out of the 12 watersheds over the calibration period. For the validation period, the advantages of the JBC method are greatly reduced as the performance becomes dependent on the watershed, GCM and hydrological metric considered. For arid/tropical and snowfall-rainfall-mixed watersheds, JBC performs better than IBC. For snowfall- or rainfall-dominated watersheds, however, the two methods behave similarly, with IBC performing somewhat better than JBC. Overall, the results emphasize the advantages of correcting the P-T correlation when using climate model-simulated precipitation and temperature to assess the impact of climate change on watershed hydrology. However, a thorough validation and a comparison with other methods are recommended before using the JBC method, since it may perform worse than the IBC method for some cases due to bias nonstationarity of climate model outputs.

AB Over the past few decades, urban floods have been gaining more attention due to their increase in frequency. To provide reliable flooding predictions in urban areas, various numerical models have been developed to perform high-resolution flood simulations. However, the use of high-resolution meshes across the whole computational domain causes a high computational burden. In this paper, a 2D control-volume and finite-element flood model using adaptive unstructured mesh technology has been developed. This adaptive unstructured mesh technique enables meshes to be adapted optimally in time and space in response to the evolving flow features, thus providing sufficient mesh resolution where and when it is required. It has the advantage of capturing the details of local flows and wetting and drying front while reducing the computational cost. Complex topographic features are represented accurately during the flooding process. For example, the high-resolution meshes around the buildings and steep regions are placed when the flooding water reaches these regions.
   In this work a flooding event that happened in 2002 in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom has been simulated to demonstrate the capability of the adaptive unstructured mesh flooding model. The simulations have been performed using both fixed and adaptive unstructured meshes, and then results have been compared with those published 2D and 3D results. The presented method shows that the 2D adaptive mesh model provides accurate results while having a low computational cost. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Coupling global climate models, hydrologic models and extreme value analysis provides a method to forecast streamflow maxima, however the elusive variance structure of the results hinders confidence in application. Directly correcting the bias of forecasts using the relative change between forecast and control simulations has been shown to marginalize hydrologic uncertainty, reduce model bias, and remove systematic variance when predicting mean monthly and mean annual streamflow, prompting our investigation for maxima streamflow. We assess the variance structure of streamflow maxima using realizations of emission scenario, global climate model type and project phase, downscaling methods, bias correction, extreme value methods, and hydrologic model inputs and parameterization. Results show that the relative change of streamflow maxima was not dependent on systematic variance from the annual maxima versus peak over threshold method applied, albeit we stress that researchers strictly adhere to rules from extreme value theory when applying the peak over threshold method. Regardless of which method is applied, extreme value model fitting does add variance to the projection, and the variance is an increasing function of the return period. Unlike the relative change of mean streamflow, results show that the variance of the maxima's relative change was dependent on all climate model factors tested as well as hydrologic model inputs and calibration. Ensemble projections forecast an increase of streamflow maxima for 2050 with pronounced forecast standard error, including an increase of +30 (+/- 21), +38(+/- 34) and +51(+/- 85)% for 2, 20 and 100 year streamflow events for the wet temperate region studied. The variance of maxima projections was dominated by climate model factors and extreme value analyses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Stemflow, despite being a small proportion of gross rainfall, is an important and understudied flux of water in forested areas. Recent studies have highlighted its complexity and relative importance for understanding soil and groundwater recharge. Stemflow dynamics offer an insight into how rain water is stored and released from the stems of trees to the soil. Past attempts have been made to understand the variability of stemflow under different types of vegetation, but rather few studies have focused on the combined influence of biotic and abiotic factors on inter and intra-storm stemflow variability, and none in Mediterranean climates. This study presents stemflow data collected at high temporal resolution for two species with contrasting canopies and bark characteristics: Quercus pubescens Willd. (downy oak) and Pinus sylvestris L. (Scots pine) in the Vallcebre research catchments (NE of Spain, 42 degrees 12'N, 1 degrees 49'E). The main objective was to understand how the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors affected stemflow dynamics. Mean stemflow production was low for both species (similar to 1% of incident rainfall) and increased with rainfall amount. However, the magnitude of the response depended on the combination of multiple biotic and abiotic factors. Both species produced similar stemflow volumes and the largest differences were found among trees of the same species. The combined analysis of biotic and abiotic factors showed that funneling ratios and stemflow dynamics were highly influenced by the interaction of rainfall intensity and tree size.

AB The Upper Blue Nile basin is considered as the lifeline for similar to 250 million people and contributes similar to 50 Gm(3)/ year of water to the Nile River. Poor land management practices in the Ethiopian highlands have caused a significant amount of soil erosion, thereby threatening the productivity of the Ethiopian agricultural system, degrading the health of the aquatic ecosystem, and shortening the life of downstream reservoirs. The Upper Blue Nile basin, because of limited research and availability of data, has been considered as the "great unknown." In the recent past, however, more research has been published. Nonetheless, there is no state-of-the-art review that presents research achievements, gaps and future directions. Hence, this paper aims to bridge this gap by reviewing the advances in water resources research in the basin while highlighting research needs and future directions. We report that there have been several research projects that try to understand the biogeochemical processes by collecting information on runoff, groundwater recharge, sediment transport, and tracers. Different types of hydrological models have been applied. Most of the earlier research used simple conceptual and statistical approaches for trend analysis and water balance estimations, mainly using rainfall and evapotranspiration data. More recent research has been using advanced semi-physically/physically based distributed hydrological models using high resolution temporal and spatial data for diverse applications. We identified several research gaps and provided recommendations to address them. While we have witnessed advances in water resources research in the basin, we also foresee opportunities for further advancement. Incorporating the research findings into policy and practice will significantly benefit the development and transformation agenda of the Ethiopian government. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Existing closed-form solutions of contaminant transport problems are limited by the mathematically convenient assumption of uniform flow. These solutions cannot be used to investigate contaminant transport in coastal aquifers where seawater intrusion induces a variable velocity field. An adaptation of the Fourier-Galerkin method is introduced to obtain semi-analytical solutions for contaminant transport in a confined coastal aquifer in which the saltwater wedge is in equilibrium with a freshwater discharge flow. Two scenarios dealing with contaminant leakage from the aquifer top surface and contaminant migration from a source at the landward boundary are considered. Robust implementation of the Fourier-Galerkin method is developed to efficiently solve the coupled flow, salt and contaminant transport equations. Various illustrative examples are generated and the semi-analytical solutions are compared against an in-house numerical code. The Fourier series are used to evaluate relevant metrics characterizing contaminant transport such as the discharge flux to the sea, amount of contaminant persisting in the groundwater and solute flux from the source. These metrics represent quantitative data for numerical code validation and are relevant to understand the effect of seawater intrusion on contaminant transport. It is observed that, for the surface contamination scenario, seawater intrusion limits the spread of the contaminant but intensifies the contaminant discharge to the sea. For the landward contamination scenario, moderate seawater intrusion affects only the spatial distribution of the contaminant plume while extreme seawater intrusion can increase the contaminant discharge to the sea. The developed semi-analytical solution presents an efficient tool for the verification of numerical models. It provides a clear interpretation of the contaminant transport processes in coastal aquifers subject to seawater intrusion. For practical usage in further studies, the full open source semi-analytical codes are made available at the website https://lhyges.unistra.fr/FAHS-Marwan. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Atmospheric evaporative demand can be used as a measure of the hydrological cycle and the global energy balance. Its long-term variation and the role of driving climatic factors have received increasingly attention in climate change studies. FAO-Penman-Monteith reference crop evapotranspiration rates were estimated for 644 meteorological stations over China for the period 1960-2011 to analyze spatial and temporal attribution variability. Attribution of climatic variables to reference crop evapotranspiration rates was not stable over the study period. While for all of China the contribution of sunshine duration remained relatively stable, the importance of relative humidity increased considerably during the last two decades, particularly in winter. Spatially distributed attribution analysis shows that the position of the center of maximum contribution of sunshine duration has shifted from Southeast to Northeast China while in West China the contribution of wind speed has decreased dramatically. In contrast relative humidity has become an important factor in most parts of China. Changes in the Asian Monsoon circulation may be responsible for altered patterns of cloudiness and a general decrease of wind speeds over China. The continuously low importance of temperature confirms that global warming does not necessarily lead to rising atmospheric evaporative demand. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID POINT RAINFALL; FREQUENCY; TRANSFORMATION; THRESHOLDS; DERIVATION
AB For the study and modeling of hydrological phenomena, both in urban and rural areas, a proper estimation of the areal reduction factor (ARF) is crucial. In this paper, we estimated the ARF from observed rainfall data as the ratio between the average rainfall occurring in a specific area and the point rainfall. Then, we compared the obtained ARF values with some of the most widespread empirical approaches in literature which are used when rainfall observations are not available. Results highlight that the literature formulations can lead to a substantial over- or underestimation of the ARF estimated from observed data. These findings can have severe consequences, especially in the design of hydraulic structures where empirical formulations are extensively applied. The aim of this paper is to present a new analytical relationship with an explicit dependence on the rainfall duration and area that can better represent the ARF-area trend over the area case of study. The analytical curve presented here can find an important application to estimate the ARF values for design purposes. The test study area is the Lazio Region (central Italy). (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Lake Hayward is one of only about 30 hypersaline lakes worldwide that is meromictic and heliothermal and as such behaves as a natural salt gradient solar pond. Lake Hayward acts as a local groundwater sink, resulting in seasonally variable hypersaline lake water with total dissolved solids (TDS) in the upper layer (mixolimnion) ranging between 56 kg m(-3) and 207 kg m(-3) and the deeper layer (monimolimnion) from 153 kg m(-3) to 211 kg m(-3). This is up to six times the salinity of seawater and thus has the highest salinity of all eleven lakes in the Yalgorup National Park lake system. A program of continuously recorded water temperature profiles has shown that salinity stratification initiated by direct rainfall onto the lake's surface and local runoff into the lake results in the onset of heliothermal conditions within hours of rainfall onset.
   The lake alternates between being fully mixed and becoming thermally and chemically stratified several times during the annual cycle, with the longest extended periods of heliothermal behaviour lasting 23 and 22 weeks in the winters of 1992 and 1993 respectively. The objective was to quantify the heat budgets of the cyclical heliothermal behaviour of Lake Hayward.
   During the period of temperature profile logging, the maximum recorded temperature of the monimolimnion was 42.6 degrees C at which time the temperature of the mixolimnion was 29.4 degrees C.
   The heat budget of two closed heliothermal cycles initiated by two rainfall events of 50 mm and 52 mm in 1993 were analysed. The cycles prevailed for 11 and 20 days respectively and the heat budget showed net heat accumulations of 34.2 MJ m(-3) and 15.4 MJ m(-3), respectively. The corresponding efficiencies of lake heat gain to incident solar energy were 0.17 and 0.18 respectively. Typically, artificial salinity gradient solar ponds (SGSP) have a solar radiation capture efficiencies ranging from 0.10 up to 0.30. Results from Lake Hayward have implications for comparative biogeochemistry and its characteristics should aid in identification of other hitherto unknown heliothermal lakes.

AB Best management practices (BMPs) are popular approaches used to improve hydrology and water quality. Uncertainties in BMP effectiveness over time may result in overestimating long-term efficiency in watershed planning strategies. To represent varying long-term BMP effectiveness in hydrologic/water quality models, a high level and forward-looking modeling framework was developed. The components in the framework consist of establishment period efficiency, starting efficiency, efficiency for each storm event, efficiency between maintenance, and efficiency over the life cycle. Combined, they represent long-term efficiency for a specific type of practice and specific environmental concern (runoff/pollutant). An approach for possible implementation of the framework was discussed. The long-term impacts of grass buffer strips (agricultural BMP) and bioretention systems (urban BMP) in reducing total phosphorus were simulated to demonstrate the framework. Data gaps were captured in estimating the long-term performance of the BMPs. A Bayesian method was used to match the simulated distribution of long-term BMP efficiencies with the observed distribution with the assumption that the observed data represented long-term BMP efficiencies. The simulated distribution matched the observed distribution well with only small total predictive uncertainties. With additional data, the same method can be used to further improve the simulation results. The modeling framework and results of this study, which can be adopted in hydrologic/water quality models to better represent long-term BMP effectiveness, can help improve decision support systems for creating long-term stormwater management strategies for watershed management projects.

AB In a groundwater flow system, the age of groundwater should gradually increase from the recharge zone to the discharge zone within the same streamline. However, it is occasionally observed that the groundwater age becomes younger in the discharge zone in the piedmont alluvial plain, and the oldest age often appears in the middle of the plain. A new set of groundwater chemistry and isotopes was employed to reassess the groundwater C-14 ages from the discharge zone in the North China Plain (NCP). Carbonate precipitation, organic matter oxidation and cross-flow mixing in the groundwater from the recharge zone to the discharge zone are recognized according to the corresponding changes of HCO3- (or DIC) and delta C-13 in the same streamline of the third aquifer of the NCP. The effects of carbonate precipitation and organic matter oxidation are calibrated with a C-13 mixing model and DIC correction, but these corrected C-14 ages seem unreasonable because they grow younger from the middle plain to the discharge zone in the NCP. The relationship of Cl- content and the recharge distance is used to estimate the expected Cl- content in the discharge zone, and In(a(14)C)/Cl is proposed to correct the a(14)C in groundwater for the effect of cross-flow mixing. The C-14 ages were reassessed with the corrected a(14)C due to the cross-flow mixing varying from 1.25 to 30.58 ka, and the groundwater becomes older gradually from the recharge zone to the discharge zone. The results suggest that the reassessed C-14 ages are more reasonable for the groundwater from the discharge zone due to cross-flow mixing.

AB The intensity and form of changes in closed lakes, upstream lakes and outflow lakes on the Third Pole (TP) differ based on their drainage mode. Researchers' insufficient understanding of the hydrological networks associated with lakes hampers studies of the relationship between lakes and climate. In this study, we establish a comprehensive hydrological network for each lake ( > 1 km(2)) on the TP using 106 Landsat images, 236 Chinese topographic maps, and SRTM DEM. Three-hundred-ninety-seven closed lakes, 488 upstream lakes and 317 outflow lakes totaling 3,5498.49 km(2), 7,378.82 km(2), and 3,382.29 km(2), respectively, were identified on the TP using 2010 data. Two-hundred-thirty-four closed lakes were found to not be linked to upstream lakes. The remaining 163 closed lakes were connected to and fed by the 488 upstream lakes. The object-oriented analyses within this study indicated that more rapid changes occurred in the surface extent of closed lakes than in upstream lakes or outflow lakes on the TP from 1970s to 2010. Furthermore, the water volume of the examined closed lakes was almost nine times greater than that of the upstream lakes from 2003 to 2009. All the examined closed lakes exhibited an obvious water volume change compared to the corresponding upstream lakes in the same basin. Furthermore, two case studies illustrate that the annual and seasonal dynamics associated with the changes in closed lakes may reflect climate change patterns, while the upstream lake dynamics may be more controlled by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics. The lake inventory and hydrological network catalogued in this study provide a basis for developing a better understanding of lake response to climate change on the TP.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning is a growing field of research in hydrology due to the significant fraction of watershed water loss it represents. The use of tracer-aided models has improved understanding of watershed processes, and has significant potential for identifying time-variable partitioning of evaporation (E) from ET. A tracer-aided model was used to establish a time-series of E/ET using differences in riverine delta O-18 and delta H-2 in four northern Canadian watersheds (lower Nelson River, Manitoba, Canada). On average E/ET follows a parabolic trend ranging from 0.7 in the spring and autumn to 0.15 (three watersheds) and 0.5 (fourth watershed) during the summer growing season. In the fourth watershed wetlands and shrubs dominate land cover. During the summer, E/ET ratios are highest in wetlands for three watersheds (10% higher than unsaturated soil storage), while lowest for the fourth watershed (20% lower than unsaturated soil storage). Uncertainty of the ET partition parameters is strongly influenced by storage volumes, with large storage volumes increasing partition uncertainty. In addition, higher simulated soil moisture increases estimated E/ET. Although unsaturated soil storage accounts for larger surface areas in these watersheds than wetlands, riverine isotopic composition is more strongly affected by E from wetlands. Comparisons of E/ET to measurement-intensive studies in similar ecoregions indicate that the methodology proposed here adequately partitions ET. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.

AB Sea level rise has already caused more frequent and severe coastal flooding and this trend will likely continue. Flood prediction is an essential part of a coastal city's capacity to adapt to and mitigate this growing problem. Complex coastal urban hydrological systems however, do not always lend themselves easily to physically-based flood prediction approaches. This paper presents a method for using a data-driven approach to estimate flood severity in an urban coastal setting using crowd-sourced data, a non-traditional but growing data source, along with environmental observation data. Two data-driven models, Poisson regression and Random Forest regression, are trained to predict the number of flood reports per storm event as a proxy for flood severity, given extensive environmental data (i.e., rainfall, tide, groundwater table level, and wind conditions) as input. The method is demonstrated using data from Norfolk, Virginia USA from September 2010 to October 2016. Quality-controlled, crowd-sourced street flooding reports ranging from 1 to 159 per storm event for 45 storm events are used to train and evaluate the models. Random Forest performed better than Poisson regression at predicting the number of flood reports and had a lower false negative rate. From the Random Forest model, total cumulative rainfall was by far the most dominant input variable in predicting flood severity, followed by low tide and lower low tide. These methods serve as a first step toward using data-driven methods for spatially and temporally detailed coastal urban flood prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is one of the most important controlling factors determining the simulation accuracy of hydraulic models. However, the currently available global topographic data is confronted with limitations for application in 2-D hydraulic modeling, mainly due to the existence of vegetation bias, random errors and insufficient spatial resolution. A hydraulic correction method (HCM) for the SRTM DEM is proposed in this study to improve modeling accuracy. Firstly, we employ the global vegetation corrected DEM (i.e. Bare-Earth DEM), developed from the SRTM DEM to include both vegetation height and SRTM vegetation signal. Then, a newly released DEM, removing both vegetation bias and random errors (i.e. Multi-Error Removed DEM), is employed to overcome the limitation of height errors. Last, an approach to correct the Multi-Error Removed DEM is presented to account for the insufficiency of spatial resolution, ensuring flow connectivity of the river networks. The approach involves: (a) extracting river networks from the Multi-Error Removed DEM using an automated algorithm in ArcGIS; (b) correcting the location and layout of extracted streams with the aid of Google Earth platform and Remote Sensing imagery; and (c) removing the positive biases of the raised segment in the river networks based on bed slope to generate the hydraulically corrected DEM. The proposed HCM utilizes easily available data and tools to improve the flow connectivity of river networks without manual adjustment. To demonstrate the advantages of HCM, an extreme flood event in Huifa River Basin (China) is simulated on the original DEM, Bare-Earth DEM, Multi-Error removed DEM, and hydraulically corrected DEM using an integrated hydrologic-hydraulic model. A comparative analysis is subsequently performed to assess the simulation accuracy and performance of four different DEMs and favorable results have been obtained on the corrected DEM.

AB In recent years climate change and other anthropogenic factors have contributed to increased wildfire frequency and size in western United States forests. This research focuses on the evaluation of spatial and temporal changes in evapotranspiration (ET) following the 2011 Las Conchas Fire in New Mexico (USA) using the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance Model (SSEBop ET). Evapotranspiration is coupled with soil burn severity and analyzed for 16 watersheds for water years 2001-2014. An average annual decrease of 120 mm of ET is observed within the regions affected by the Las Conchas Fire, and conifers were converted to grassland a year after the fire. On average, the post-fire annual ET in high, moderate, and low burn severity is lower than pre-fire ET by approximately 103-352 mm, 97-304 mm, and 91-268 mm, respectively. The ratio of post-fire evapotranspiration to precipitation (ET/P) is statistically different from pre-fire conditions (alpha = 0.05) in nine of the watersheds. The largest decrease in ET is approximately 13-57 mm per month and is most prominent during the summer (April to September). The observed decrease in ET contributes to our understanding of changes in water yield following wild-fires, which is of interest for accurately modeling and predicting hydrologic processes in semi-arid landscapes.

AB This study treats the catchment as a block box system with considering the rainfall input and runoff output being a stochastic process. The temporal rainfall-runoff relationship at the catchment scale is described by a convolution integral on a continuous time scale. Using the Fourier-Stieltjes representation approach, a frequency domain solution to the convolution integral is developed to the spectral analysis of runoff processes generated by temporal non-stationary rainfall events. It is shown that the characteristic time scale of rainfall process increases the runoff discharge variability, while the catchment mean travel time constant plays the role in reducing the variability of runoff discharge. Similar to the behavior of groundwater aquifers, catchments act as a low-pass filter in the frequency domain for the rainfall input signal. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As two key threats to receiving water bodies, the generation mechanisms and processes of urban and agricultural nonpoint sources (NPSs) show clear differences, which lead to distinct characteristics of water quality responses with mixed land-uses catchments compared to single land-use ones. However, few studies have provided such insights in these characteristic or quantified different water environment responses to NPS pollution. In this study, an integrated modelling approach was developed for those complex catchments by combining three commonly used models: SWMM (Storm Water Management Model), SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and MIKE 11. A case study was performed in a typical urban-rural catchment of Chao Lake, China. The simulated results indicated that urban NPS pollution responded sensitively to rainfall events and was greatly affected by the antecedent dry days. Compare to urban NPS, agricultural NPS pollution was characterized with the time-lag to rainfall depended on soil moisture and the post-rain-season emissions carried by lateral flows, and were also affected by the local farm-practice schedule. With comprehensive impacts from urban-rural land-uses, the time-interleaved urban and agricultural NPS pollution emissions and more abundant pollution accumulation both led to a decrease in the responsive time and an increase in the frequency of peak pollution concentration values even during the dry season. These obtained characteristics can provide guidance for drafting watershed management plans in similar mixed land use catchments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved:

AB The copula functions have been widely applied as an advance technique to create joint probability distribution of drought duration and severity. The approach of data collection as well as the amount of data and dispersion of data series can last a significant impact on creating such joint probability distribution using copulas. Usually, such traditional analyses have shed an Unconnected Drought Runs (UDR) approach towards droughts. In other word, droughts with different durations would be independent of each other. Emphasis on such data collection method causes the omission of actual potentials of short-term extreme droughts located within a long-term UDR. Meanwhile, traditional method is often faced with significant gap in drought data series. However, a long-term UDR can be approached as a combination of short-term Connected Drought Runs (CDR). Therefore this study aims to evaluate systematically two UDR and CDR procedures in joint probability of drought duration and severity investigations. For this purpose, rainfall data (1971-2013) from 24 rain gauges in Lake Urmia basin, Iran were applied. Also, seven common univariate marginal distributions and seven types of bivariate copulas were examined. Compared to traditional approach, the results demonstrated a significant comparative advantage of the new approach. Such comparative advantages led to determine the correct copula function, more accurate estimation of copula parameter, more realistic estimation of joint/conditional probabilities of drought duration and severity and significant reduction in uncertainty for modeling.

AB In sparsely fractured rock, the ubiquitous heterogeneity of the matrix, which has been observed in different laboratory and in situ experiments, has been shown to have a significant influence on retardation mechanisms that are of importance for the safety of deep geological repositories for nuclear waste. Here, we propose a conceptualisation of a typical heterogeneous granitic rock matrix based on micro Discrete Fracture Networks (micro-DFN). Different sets of fractures are used to represent grain boundary pores as well as micro fractures that transect different mineral grains. The micro-DFN model offers a great flexibility in the way inter- and intra-granular space is represented as the different parameters that characterise each fracture set can be fine tuned to represent samples of different characteristics. Here, the parameters of the model have been calibrated against experimental observations from granitic rock samples taken at Forsmark (Sweden) and different variant cases have been used to illustrate how the model can be tied to rock samples with different attributes. Numerical through-diffusion simulations have been carried out to infer the bulk properties of the model as well as to compare the computed mass flux with the experimental data from an analogous laboratory experiment. The general good agreement between the model results and the experimental observations shows that the model presented here is a reliable tool for the understanding of retardation mechanisms occurring at the mm-scale in the matrix.

AB Changes in the extent and amount of snow cover in Eurasia are of great interest because of their vital impacts on the global climate system and regional water resource management. This study investigated the spatial and temporal variability of the snow cover extent (SCE) and snow water equivalent (SWE) of the continental Eurasia using the Northern Hemisphere Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid (EASE-Grid) Weekly SCE data for 1972-2006 and the Global Monthly EASE-Grid SWE data for 1979-2004. The results indicated that, in general, the spatial extent of snow cover significantly decreased during spring and summer, but varied little during autumn and winter over Eurasia in the study period. The date at which snow cover began to disappear in spring has significantly advanced, whereas the timing of snow cover onset in autumn did not vary significantly during 1972-2006. The snow cover persistence period declined significantly in the western Tibetan Plateau as well as partial area of Central Asia and northwestern Russia, but varied little in other parts of Eurasia. "Snow-free breaks" (SFBs) with intermittent snow cover in the cold season were principally observed in the Tibetan Plateau and Central Asia, causing a low sensitivity of snow cover persistence period to the timings of snow cover onset and disappearance over the areas with shallow snow. The averaged SFBs were 1-14 weeks during the study period and the maximum intermittence could even reach 25 weeks in certain years. At a seasonal scale, SWE usually peaked in February or March, but fell gradually since April across Eurasia. Both annual mean and annual maximum SWE decreased significantly during 1979-2004 in most parts of Eurasia except for eastern Siberia as well as northwestern and northeastern China. The possible cross-platform inconsistencies between two passive microwave radiometers may cause uncertainties in the detected trends of SWE here, suggesting an urgent need of producing a long-term, more homogeneous SWE product in future.

AB The response of stream chemistry to storm is of major interest for understanding the export of dissolved and particulate species from catchments. The related challenge is the identification of active hydrological flow paths during these events and of the sources of chemical elements for which these events are hot moments of exports. An original four-year data set that combines high frequency records of stream flow, turbidity, nitrate and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, and piezometric levels was used to characterize storm responses in a headwater agricultural catchment. The data set was used to test to which extend the shallow groundwater was impacting the variability of storm responses. A total of 177 events were described using a set of quantitative and functional descriptors related to precipitation, stream and groundwater pre-event status and event dynamics, and to the relative dynamics between water quality parameters and flow via hysteresis indices. This approach led to identify different types of response for each water quality parameter which occurrence can be quantified and related to the seasonal functioning of the catchment. This study demonstrates that high-frequency records of water quality are precious tools to study/unique in their ability to emphasize the variability of catchment storm responses.

AB Rain gauge observations are commonly used to evaluate the quality of satellite precipitation products. However, the inherent difference between point-scale gauge measurements and areal satellite precipitation, i.e. a point of space in time accumulation v.s. a snapshot of time in space aggregation, has an important effect on the accuracy and precision of qualitative and quantitative evaluation results. This study aims to quantify the uncertainty caused by various combinations of spatiotemporal scales (0.1 degrees-0.8 degrees and 1-24 h) of gauge network designs in the densely gauged and relatively flat Ganjiang River basin, South China, in order to evaluate the state-of-the-art satellite precipitation, the Integrated Multi satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG). For comparison with the dense gauge network serving as "ground truth", 500 sparse gauge networks are generated through random combinations of gauge numbers at each set of spatiotemporal scales. Results show that all sparse gauge networks persistently underestimate the performance of IMERG according to most metrics. However, the probability of detection is overestimated because hit and miss events are more likely fewer than the reference numbers derived from dense gauge networks. A nonlinear error function of spatiotemporal scales and the number of gauges in each grid pixel is developed to estimate the errors of using gauges to evaluate satellite precipitation. Coefficients of determination of the fitting are above 0.9 for most metrics. The error function can also be used to estimate the required minimum number of gauges in each grid pixel to meet a predefined error level. This study suggests that the actual quality of satellite precipitation products could be better than conventionally evaluated or expected, and hopefully enables non-subject-matter expert researchers to have better understanding of the explicit uncertainties when using point-scale gauge observations to evaluate areal products.

AB This paper advances the physical understanding of the flow duration curve (FDC) regional variation. It provides a process-based analysis of the interaction between climate and landscape properties to explain disparities in FDC shapes. We used (i) long term measured flow and precipitation data over 73 catchments from the eastern US. (ii) We calibrated the Sacramento model (SAC-SMA) to simulate soil moisture and flow components FDCs. The catchments classification based on storm characteristics pointed to the effect of catchments landscape properties on the precipitation variability and consequently on the FDC shapes. The landscape properties effect was pronounce such that low value of the slope of FDC (SFDC) hinting at limited flow variability-were present in regions of high precipitation variability. Whereas, in regions with low precipitation variability the SFDCs were of larger values. The topographic index distribution, at the catchment scale, indicated that saturation excess overland flow mitigated the flow variability under conditions of low elevations with large soil moisture storage capacity and high infiltration rates. The SFDCs increased due to the predominant subsurface stormflow in catchments at high elevations with limited soil moisture storage capacity and low infiltration rates. Our analyses also highlighted the major role of soil infiltration rates on the FDC despite the impact of the predominant runoff generation mechanism and catchment elevation. In conditions of slow infiltration rates in soils of large moisture storage capacity (at low elevations) and predominant saturation excess, the SFDCs were of larger values. On the other hand, the SFDCs decreased in catchments of prevalent subsurface stormflow and poorly drained soils of small soil moisture storage capacity. The analysis of the flow components FDCs demonstrated that the interflow contribution to the response was the higher in catchments with large value of slope of the FDC. The surface flow FDC was the most affected by the precipitation as it tracked the precipitation duration curve (PDC). In catchments with low SFDCs, this became less applicable as surface flow FDC diverged from PDC at the upper tail (> 40% of the flow percentile). The interflow and baseflow FDCs illustrated most the filtering effect on the precipitation. The process understanding we achieved in this study is key for flow simulation and assessment in addition to future works focusing on process-based FDC predictions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Probabilistic modelling of drought events is a significant aspect of water resources management and planning. In this study, popularly applied and several relatively new bivariate Archimedean copulas were employed to derive regional and spatial based copula models to appraise drought risk in mainland China over 1961-2013. Drought duration (Dd), severity (Ds), and peak (Dp), as indicated by Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), were extracted according to the run theory and fitted with suitable marginal distributions. The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and curve fitting method (CFM) were used to estimate the copula parameters of nineteen bivariate Archimedean copulas. Drought probabilities and return periods were analysed based on appropriate bivariate copula in sub-region I-VII and entire mainland China. The goodness-of-fit tests as indicated by the CFM showed that copula NN19 in sub-regions III, IV, V, VI and mainland China, NN20 in sub-region I and NN13 in sub-region VII are the best for modeling drought variables. Bivariate drought probability across mainland China is relatively high, and the highest drought probabilities are found mainly in the Northwestern and Southwestern China. Besides, the result also showed that different sub-regions might suffer varying drought risks. The drought risks as observed in Sub-region III, VI and VII, are significantly greater than other sub-regions. Higher probability of droughts of longer durations in the sub-regions also corresponds to shorter return periods with greater drought severity. These results may imply tremendous challenges for the water resources management in different sub-regions, particularly the Northwestern and Southwestern China. 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Previous studies have shown that geostatistics-based transient hydraulic tomography (THT) is robust for subsurface heterogeneity characterization through the joint inverse modeling of multiple pumping tests. However, the hydraulic conductivity (K) and specific storage (S-s) estimates can be smooth or even erroneous for areas where pumping/observation densities are low. This renders the imaging of interlayer and intralayer heterogeneity of highly contrasting materials including their unit boundaries difficult. In this study, we further test the performance of THT by utilizing existing and newly collected pumping test data of longer durations that showed drawdown responses in both aquifer and aquitard units at a field site underlain by a highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial deposit. The robust performance of the THT is highlighted through the comparison of different degrees of model parameterization including: (1) the effective parameter approach; (2) the geological zonation approach relying on borehole logs; and (3) the geostatistical inversion approach considering different prior information (with/without geological data). Results reveal that the simultaneous analysis of eight pumping tests with the geostatistical inverse model yields the best results in terms of model calibration and validation. We also find that the joint interpretation of long-term drawdown data from aquifer and aquitard units is necessary in mapping their full heterogeneous patterns including intralayer variabilities. Moreover, as geological data are included as prior information in the geostatistics-based THT analysis, the estimated K values increasingly reflect the vertical distribution patterns of permeameter-estimated K in both aquifer and aquitard units. Finally, the comparison of various THT approaches reveals that differences in the estimated K and S-s tomograms result in significantly different transient drawdown predictions at observation ports.

AB For three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations in inland waters, the rapid changes with moving boundary and various input conditions should be considered. Some models are developed with moving boundary but the dynamic change of discharges is unresolved or ignored. For better hydrodynamic simulation in inland waters, the widely used 3D model, ECOMSED, has been improved by moving confluence route (MCR) method with a wetting and drying scheme (WAD). The fixed locations of water and pollutants inputs from tributaries, point sources and non-point sources have been changed to dynamic confluence routes as the boundary moving. The improved model was applied in an inland water area, Qingshuihai reservoir, Kunming City, China, for a one-year hydrodynamic simulation. The results were verified by water level, flow velocity and water mass conservation. Detailed water level variation analysis and velocity field comparison at different times showed that the improved model has better performance for simulating the boundary moving phenomenon and moving discharges along with water level changing than the original one. The improved three-dimensional model is available for hydrodynamics simulation in water bodies where water boundary shifts along with change of water level and have various inlets.

AB Retention Soil Filters (RSFs), a form of vertical flow constructed wetlands specifically designed for combined sewer overflow (CSO) treatment, have proven to be an effective tool to mitigate negative impacts of CSOs on receiving water bodies. Long-term hydrologic simulations are used to predict the emissions from urban drainage systems during planning of stormwater management measures. So far no universally accepted model for RSF simulation exists. When simulating hydraulics and water quality in RSFs, an appropriate level of detail must be chosen for reasonable balancing between model complexity and model handling, considering the model input's level of uncertainty.
   The most crucial parameters determining the resultant uncertainties of the integrated sewer system and filter bed model were identified by evaluating a virtual drainage system with a Retention Soil Filter for CSO treatment. To determine reasonable parameter ranges for RSF simulations, data of 207 events from six full-scale RSF plants in Germany were analyzed.
   Data evaluation shows that even though different plants with varying loading and operation modes were examined, a simple model is sufficient to assess relevant suspended solids (SS), chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH4 emissions from RSFs. Two conceptual RSF models with different degrees of complexity were assessed. These models were developed based on evaluation of data from full scale RSF plants and column experiments. Incorporated model processes are ammonium adsorption in the filter layer and degradation during subsequent dry weather period, filtration of SS and particulate COD (X-COD) to a constant background concentration and removal of solute COD (S-COD) by a constant removal rate during filter passage as well as sedimentation of SS and X-COD in the filter overflow.
   X-COD, SS and ammonium loads as well as ammonium concentration peaks are discharged primarily via RSF overflow not passing through the filter bed. Uncertainties of the integrated simulation of the sewer system and RSF model mainly originate from the model parameters of the hydrologic sewer system model. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In the present study, three types of artificial intelligence techniques, least square support vector machine (LSSVM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and M5 model tree (M5T) are applied for modeling daily dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration using several water quality variables as inputs. The DO concentration and water quality variables data from three stations operated by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) were used for developing the three models. The water quality data selected consisted of daily measured of water temperature (TE, degrees C), pH (std. unit), specific conductance (SC, mu S/cm) and discharge (DI cfs), are used as inputs to the LSSVM, MARS and M5T models. The three models were applied for each station separately and compared to each other. According to the results obtained, it was found that: (i) the DO concentration could be successfully estimated using the three models and (ii) the best model among all others differs from one station to another.

AB Groundwater-fed agriculture has caused water table declines and groundwater quality degradation in the North China Plain. Based on sediment sampling in deep vadose zone (with a maximum depth of 11.0 m), groundwater recharge, seepage velocity, solute inventory and transport under four typical irrigated agricultural land-use types (winter wheat and summer maize, WM; pear orchards, PO; outdoor vegetables, VE; and cotton, CO) were investigated in this study. The results reveal that there are many solutes stored in the vadose zone. Nitrate storage per unit depth in the vadose zone is highest under PO (1703 kg/ha), followed by VE (970 kg/ha), WM (736 kg/ha) and CO (727 kg/ha). However, the amount of annual leached nitrate under the four land-use types results in a different order (VE, 404 kg/ha; WM, 108 kg/ha; PO, 23 kg/ha; CO, 13 kg/ha). The estimated average recharge rates are 180 mm/yr for WM, 27 mm/yr for CO, 320 mm/yr for VE and 49 mm/yr for PO. The seepage velocity under VE (2.22 m/yr) exceeds the values under the other three land-use types (WM, 0.85 m/yr; PO, 0.49 m/yr; CO, 0.09 m/yr). The highest seepage velocity under VE caused significant nitrate contamination in groundwater, whereas the other two land-use types (WM and PO) had no direct influence on groundwater quality. The results of this work could be used for groundwater resources management. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The canopy storage capacity (S) is a major component of the surface water balance. We analysed the relationship between the tree canopy water storage capacity and leaf wettability under changing simulated rainfall temperature. We estimated the effect of the rain temperature change on the canopy storage capacity and contact angle of leave and needle surfaces based on two scenarios. Six dominant forest trees were analysed: English oak (Quercus roburL), common beech (Papas sylvatica L), small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata Mill), silver fir (Abies alba), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.),and Norway spruce (Picea abies L). Twigs of these species were collected from Krynica Zdroj, that is, the Experimental Forestry unit of the University of Agriculture in Cracow (southern Poland). Experimental analyses (simulations of precipitation) were performed in a laboratory under controlled conditions. The canopy storage capacity and leaf wettability classification were determined at 12 water temperatures and a practical calculator to compute changes of S and contact angles of droplets was developed. Among all species, an increase of the rainfall temperature by 0.7 degrees C decreases the contact angle between leave and needle surfaces by 2.41 degrees and increases the canopy storage capacity by 0.74 g g(-1); an increase of the rain temperature by 2.7 degrees C decreases the contact angle by 9.29 degrees and increases the canopy storage capacity by 2.85 g g(-1). A decreased contact angle between a water droplet and leaf surface indicates increased wettability. Thus, our results show that an increased temperature increases the leaf wettability in all examined species. The comparison of different species implies that the water temperature has the strongest effect on spruce and the weakest effect on oak. These data indicate that the rainfall temperature influences the canopy storage capacity. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We investigated the interactions of Lake Merzbacher with the Southern Inylchek Glacier (Central Tien Shan) using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Pixel Offset-Small Baseline Subset (PO-SBAS) to derive a time series of three-dimensional (3D) glacier motion. The measurements of 3D glacier velocity were similar to 17% more precise than a previous study that did not use the SBAS estimation. The velocities of the glacier were up to 58 cm/day east, 70 cm/day north, and 113 cm/day vertically. Combining these data with Landsat images indicated that movement of the glacier is sensitive to changes of Lake Merzbacher. Specifically, the entry of more lake water into the glacier during the ablation season increased englacial ablation due to thermal erosion. Moreover, ice calving begins when the lake water gradually lifts the ice dam. Calving can cause greater loss of glacier mass than normal ablation. Trying to replenish the front mass loss, the distributary accelerates and the mass loss further intensifies. A time series of the vertical velocity indicates that the glacier tongue has a huge englacial cavity. We suggest that the lake outburst is directly related to the crack of this cavity. Bursting of the lake triggers a mini-surge at the glacier tongue. The vertical velocity at the ice dam was similar to+60 cm/day before the lake outburst, and similar to-113 cm/day afterwards. After drainage of the lake, flow velocities at the distributary, do not sharply decrease because pre-drainage mass loss needs to be replenished by fast flow. Based on comparisons with previous measurements, our results indicate that the lake had an increasing influence on the glacier from 2005 to 2009. This study demonstrates that a time series of 3D glacier motion based on the PO-SBAS technique is effective for assessing the dynamics of a mountain glacial system and interactions with its glacial lake.

AB Pre-excavation dewatering (PED) is an important construction stage in deep excavation. Field measurements show that retaining walls can develop obvious deflections during PED, which has been rarely considered in the past. The characteristics of PED-induced wall deflection, and the relationship of this deflection to surrounding ground deformation are still unclear. In this study, a PED test is simulated by a numerical model. The model is verified by field observations and used to investigate the responses of retaining wall and surrounding ground to PED. Results indicate that the maximum wall defection (delta(hm)) and surface settlement (delta(vm)) can all reach centimeter level under common conditions of PED. The ratio of delta(vm) to delta(hm) varies at the range of 0.45-0.67. Wall and soil deformations will be more obvious if the soils within the dewatering depth (H-d) have better permeability. The relative positions between H-d and strata (i.e., aquifer or aquitard) have great influence on the PED-induced deformations. If an aquifer appears below H-d, further increasing H-d can induce a rapid growth of wall and soil deformations. If thick aquitard appears below H-d, the deformation increments by further increasing H-d are not apparent. However, once H-d exceeds the center of the thick aquitard and reaches a thick confined aquifer, the wall deflections and soil deformation zones behind the wall will enlarge significantly. Meanwhile, a large bending moment in the retaining wall will arise around the bottom of the confined aquifer. The designers should consider this condition and allocate enough steel rebars there, preventing the appearance of wall cracks in the confined aquifer. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Identifying nonpoint sources of nitrate has been a long-term challenge in mixed land-use watershed. In the present study, we combine dual nitrate isotope, runoff and stream water monitoring to elucidate the nonpoint nitrate sources across land use, and determine the relative importance of biogeochemical processes for nitrate export in a small suburban watershed, Longhongjian watershed, China. Our study suggested that NH4+ fertilizer, soil NH4+, litter fall and groundwater were the main nitrate sources in Longhongjian Stream. There were large changes in nitrate sources in response to season and land use. Runoff analysis illustrated that the tea plantation and forest areas contributed to a dominated proportion of the TN export. Spatial analysis illustrated that NO3- concentration was high in the tea plantation and forest areas, and delta N-15-NO3 and delta O-18-NO3 were enriched in the step ponds. Temporal analysis showed high NO3- level in spring, and nitrate isotopes were enriched in summer. Study as well showed that the step ponds played an important role in mitigating nitrate pollution. Nitrification and plant uptake were the significant biogeochemical processes contributing to the nitrogen transformation, and denitrification hardly occurred in the stream.

AB As the relationship between vegetation and soil moisture is complex and reciprocal, there is a need to understand how spatial patterns in soil moisture influence the distribution of vegetation, and how the structure of vegetation canopies and root networks regulates the partitioning of precipitation. Spatial patterns of soil moisture are often difficult to visualise as usually, soil moisture is measured at point scales, and often difficult to extrapolate. Here, we address the difficulties in collecting large amounts of spatial soil moisture data through a study combining plot- and transect-scale electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys to estimate soil moisture in a 3.2 km(2) upland catchment in the Scottish Highlands. The aim was to assess the spatio-temporal variability in soil moisture under Scots pine forest (Pinus sylvestris) and heather moorland shrubs (Calluna vulgaris); the two dominant vegetation types in the Scottish Highlands. The study focussed on one year of fortnightly ERT surveys. The surveyed resistivity data was inverted and Archie's law was used to calculate volumetric soil moisture by estimating parameters and comparing against field measured data. Results showed that spatial soil moisture patterns were more heterogeneous in the forest site, as were patterns of wetting and drying, which can be linked to vegetation distribution and canopy structure. The heather site showed a less heterogeneous response to wetting and drying, reflecting the more uniform vegetation cover of the shrubs. Comparing soil moisture temporal variability during growing and non-growing seasons revealed further contrasts: under the heather there was little change in soil moisture during the growing season. Greatest changes in the forest were in areas where the trees were concentrated reflecting water uptake and canopy partitioning. Such differences have implications for climate and land use changes; increased forest cover can lead to greater spatial variability, greater growing season temporal variability, and reduced levels of soil moisture, whilst projected decreasing summer precipitation may alter the feedbacks between soil moisture and vegetation water use and increase growing season soil moisture deficits.

AB The aim of this study is to examine the contribution of North Atlantic tropical cyclones (TCs) to flooding and heavy rainfall across the continental United States. Analyses highlight the spatial variability in these hazards, their temporal changes in terms of frequency and magnitude, and their connection to large-scale climate, in particular to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We use long-term stream and rain gage measurements, and our analyses are based on annual maxima (AMs) and peaks-over-threshold (POTs). TCs contribute to similar to 20-30% of AMs and POTs over Florida and coastal areas of the eastern United States, and the contribution decreases as we move inland. We do not detect statistically significant trends in the magnitude or frequency of TC floods. Regarding the role of climate, NAO and ENSO do not play a large role in controlling the frequency and magnitude of TC flooding. The connection between heavy rainfall and TCs is comparable to what observed in terms of flooding. Unlike flooding, NAO plays a significant role in TC-related extreme rainfall along the U.S. East Coast, while ENSO is most strongly linked to the TC precipitation in Texas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Microbiological contamination usually leads to erratic operation of drinking water wells and disinfection is required after disasters and sometimes to restore proper well performance for aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) and subsurface iron removal (SIR) wells. This study focused on estimating the fate of chlorine around an infiltration well and improving the knowledge about processes that control the physical extent of the disinfected/affected radius. Closed bottle batch tests revealed low chlorine consumption rates for filter gravel and sand (0.005 mg/g/d) and higher rates for clay (0.030 mg/g/d) as well as natural aquifer material (0.054 mg/g/d). Smaller grain sizes <1 mm showed 10- to 70-times higher initial chlorine consumption rates within the first hour after contact compared to the median consumption rates. Initial chlorine concentration most likely does not impact disinfection ability at grain sizes >1 mm, but results in more effective disinfection for very fine material <0.063 mm. Column studies focused on the adaptation of the lab results to an actual SIR waterworks in Khabarovsk, Russia. Results reinforced the previous lab results with low 1st-order decay constants of 16 d(-1) for filter material and much higher values of 254 d(-1) for natural aquifer material. Application of the chlorine consumption rates to an example well consistently indicated that the filter gravel pack consumes <1% of infiltrated chlorine. The disinfection zone at the example well seems to extend to maximum 3.5 m into the aquifer. Excessive chlorine dosage of >10 mg/l would not further extend the disinfected radius. A preferable way to increase the range of chlorine application is to increase the total infiltrated volume and time. Three approaches are proposed for adapting lab results to actual infiltration wells, that are in principle applicable to any other site. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Most soil water balance models only consider downward soil water movement driven by gravitational potential, and thus cannot simulate upward soil water movement driven by evapotranspiration especially in agricultural areas. In addition, the models cannot be used for simulating soil water movement in heterogeneous soils, and usually require many empirical parameters. To resolve these problems, this study derives a new one-dimensional water balance model for simulating both downward and upward soil water movement in heterogeneous unsaturated zones. The new model is based on a hybrid of numerical and statistical methods, and only requires four physical parameters. The model uses three governing equations to consider three terms that impact soil water movement, including the advective term driven by gravitational potential, the source/sink term driven by external forces (e.g., evapotranspiration), and the diffusive term driven by matric potential. The three governing equations are solved separately by using the hybrid numerical and statistical methods (e.g., linear regression method) that consider soil heterogeneity. The four soil hydraulic parameters required by the new models are as follows: saturated hydraulic conductivity, saturated water content, field capacity, and residual water content. The strength and weakness of the new model are evaluated by using two published studies, three hypothetical examples and a real-world application. The evaluation is performed by comparing the simulation results of the new model with corresponding results presented in the published studies, obtained using HYDRUS-1D and observation data. The evaluation indicates that the new model is accurate and efficient for simulating upward soil water flow in heterogeneous soils with complex boundary conditions. The new model is used for evaluating different drainage functions, and the square drainage function and the power drainage function are recommended. Computational efficiency of the new model makes it particularly suitable for large-scale simulation of soil water movement, because the new model can be used with coarse discretization in space and time.

AB The impacts of urbanization on floods, droughts and the overall river regime have been largely investigated in the past few decades, but the quantification and the prediction of such impacts still remain a challenge in hydrology. We gathered a sample of 142 catchments that have a documented increase in urban areas over the hydrometeorological record period in the United States. The changes in river flow regimes due to urban spread were differentiated from climate variability using the GR4J conceptual hydrological model. High, low and mean flows were impacted at a threshold of a 10% total impervious area. Moreover, the historical evolution of urban landscape spatial patterns was used to further detail the urbanization process in terms of extent and fragmentation of urban areas throughout the catchment and to help interpret the divergent impacts observed in streamflow behaviors. Regression analysis pointed out the importance of major wastewater treatment facilities that might overpass the effects of imperviousness, and therefore further research should either take them explicitly into account or select a wastewater facility-free catchment sample to clearly evaluate the impacts of urban landscape on low flows.

AB Despite its societal relevance, the question whether fluctuations in flood occurrence or magnitude are coherent in space has hardly been addressed in quantitative terms. We investigate this question for Germany by analysing fluctuations in annual maximum series (AMS) values at 68 discharge gauges for the common time period 1932-2005. We find remarkable spatial coherence across Germany given its different flood regimes. For example, there is a tendency that flood-rich/-poor years in sub-catchments of the Rhine basin, which are dominated by winter floods, coincide with flood-rich/-poor years in the southern sub-catchments of the Danube basin, which have their dominant flood season in summer. Our findings indicate that coherence is caused rather by persistence in catchment wetness than by persistent periods of higher/lower event precipitation. Further, we propose to differentiate between event-type and non-event-type coherence. There are quite a number of hydrological years with considerable nonevent-type coherence, i.e. AMS values of the 68 gauges are spread out through the year but in the same magnitude range. Years with extreme flooding tend to be of event-type and non-coherent, i.e. there is at least one precipitation event that affects many catchments to various degree. Although spatial coherence is a remarkable phenomenon, and large-scale flooding across Germany can lead to severe situations, extreme magnitudes across the whole country within one event or within one year were not observed in the investigated period.

AB The assessment for impacts of climate variability and human activities on suspended sediment yield (SSY) change has long been a question of great interest. However, the sediment generation processes are sophisticated with high nonlinearity and great uncertainty, which give rise to extreme complexity for SSY change assessment in Newtonian approach. Consequently, few approaches can be simply but widely applied to decompose impacts of climatic variability and human activities on SSY change. Thus, it is an urgent need to develop advanced methods that are simple and robust. Since that the Newtonian approach is hardly achievable due to limitation of either observations or knowledge of mechanisms, there have been repeated calls to capture the hydrologic system in Darwinian approach for hydrological change prediction or explanation. As streamflow is the carrier of suspended sediment, SSY change are thus documented in changes of sediment concentrated flow and suspended sediment concentration - water discharge (C-Q) relationships. By deduced corollaries, a differential equation of sediment discharge change was derived to explicitly decompose impacts of climate variability and human activities in Darwinian hydrology. Besides, a new form of sediment rating curves was proposed and curved as C-Q relationships and probability distribution of sediment concentrated flow. River sediment flux can be revealed by this representation, which simply elucidates mechanism of SSY generation covering a range of time scales from finer than rainfall-event to long term. By the new sediment rating curves, the differential equation was partly solved using a segmentation algorithm proposed and validated in this paper, and then was submitted to water balance framework expressed by Budyko-type equation. Thus, for catchment management, hydrologists can obtain explicit explanation of how climate variation and human activities propagate through landscape and result in sediment discharge change. The differential equation is simple and robust for widely application in sediment discharge change assessment, as only discrete data of precipitation, potential evaporation and C-Q observed at gauging stations are required.

AB Rapid groundwater depletion from the northwestern Indian aquifer system in the western Indo-Gangetic basin has raised serious concerns over the sustainability of groundwater and the livelihoods that depend on it. Sustainable management of this aquifer system requires that we understand the sources and rates of groundwater recharge, however, both these parameters are poorly constrained in this region. Here we analyse the isotopic (delta O-18, delta H-2 and tritium) compositions of groundwater, precipitation, river and canal water to identify the recharge sources, zones of recharge, and groundwater flow in the Ghaggar River basin, which lies between the Himalayan -fed Yamuna and Sutlej River systems in northwestern India. Our results reveal that local precipitation is the main source of groundwater recharge. However, depleted delta O-18 and delta H-2 signatures at some sites indicate recharge from canal seepage and irrigation return flow. The spatial variability of delta O-18, delta H-2, d -excess, and tritium reflects limited lateral connectivity due to the heterogeneous and anisotropic nature of the aquifer system in the study area. The variation of tritium concentration with depth suggests that groundwater above c. 80 mbgl is generally modern water. In contrast, water from below c. 80 mbgl is a mixture of modern and old waters, and indicates longer residence time in comparison to groundwater above c. 80 mbgl. Isotopic signatures of delta O-18, delta H-2 and tritium suggest significant vertical recharge down to a depth of 320 mbgl. The spatial and vertical variations of isotopic signature of groundwater reveal two distinct flow patterns in the aquifer system: (i) local flow (above c. 80 mbgl) throughout the study area, and (ii) intermediate and regional flow (below c. 80 mbgl), where water recharges aquifers through large-scale lateral flow as well as vertical infiltration. The understanding of spatial and vertical recharge processes of groundwater in the study area provides important baseline knowledge for developing a sustainable groundwater management plan for the northwestern Indian aquifer system.

AB The recharge mechanism of groundwater in the Badain Jaran Desert, North China has been a focus of research and still disputable in the past two decades. In this study, the chemical and hydrogen (H) and oxygen (0) isotopic characteristics of shallow groundwater, lake water and local precipitation in the Badain Jaran Desert and neighboring areas were investigated to reveal the relationships between various water bodies and the recharge source of shallow groundwater. Isotopic and hydrogeochemical results show that (I) shallow groundwater was associated with local precipitation in the Ayouqi and Yabulai regions, (2) lake water was mainly recharged by groundwater in the desert hinterland, (3) shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland, Yabulai Mountain and Gurinai Grassland had a common recharge source. Shallow groundwater of the desert hinterland had a mean recharge elevation of 1869 m a.s.l. on the basis of the isotope-altitude relationship and thus originated chiefly from lateral infiltration of precipitation in the Yabulai Mountain. It is further concluded that shallow groundwater flowed towards the Gurinai Grassland according to the groundwater table contour map. Along the flow pathway, the H-O isotopic variations were primarily caused by the evaporation effect but chemical variations of shallow groundwater were affected by multiple factors, e.g., evaporation effect, dilution effect of occasional heavy-precipitation and dissolution of aquifer evaporites. Our findings provide new insight into the groundwater cycle and benefit the management of the limited water resources in the arid desert area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Water recirculation through permeable sediments induced by wave action, tidal pumping and currents enhances the exchange of solutes and fine particles between sediments and overlying waters, and can be an important hydro-biogeochemical process. In shallow water, most of the recirculation is likely to be driven by the interaction of wave-driven oscillatory flows with bottom topography which can induce pressure fluctuations at the sediment-water interface on very short timescales. Tracer-based methods provide the most reliable means for characterizing this short-timescale exchange. However, the commonly applied approaches only provide a direct measure of the tracer flux. Estimating water fluxes requires characterizing the tracer concentration in discharging porewater; this implies collecting pore water samples at shallow depths (usually a few mm, depending on the hydrodynamic dispersivity), which is very difficult with commonly used techniques. In this study, we simulate observed vertical profiles of radon concentration beneath shallow coastal lagoons using a simple water recirculation model that allows us to estimate water exchange fluxes as a function of depth below the sediment-water interface. Estimated water fluxes at the sediment water interface at our site were 0.18-0.25 m/day, with fluxes decreasing exponentially with depth. Uncertainty in dispersivity is the greatest source of error in exchange flux, and results in an uncertainty of approximately a factor-of-five. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WATER-CONTENT; PEATLAND; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; GROWTH; SOILS
AB Due to the non-vascular nature of Sphagnum mosses, the capitula (growing surface) of the moss must rely solely on capillary action to receive water from beneath. Moss subsides and swells in accordance with water table levels, an effect called "mire-breathing", which has been thought to be a self-preservation mechanism, although no systematic studies have been done to demonstrate exactly how volume change affects hydrophysical properties of moss. In this study, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (Kunsat) and water content of two different species of Sphagnum moss were measured at different compression rates, up to the maximum of 77%. The findings show that the Kunsat increases by up to an order of magnitude (10x) with compression up to a certain bulk density of the moss, after which higher levels of compression result in lowered unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. This was coupled with an increase in soil water retention with increased compression. The increase of the Kunsat with compression suggests that the mire-breathing effect should be considered a self-preservation mechanism to provide sufficient amount of water to growing moss in times of low water availability.

AB The utilization of ecosystem services in flood management is challenged by the complexity of human nature interactions and practical implementation barriers towards more ecosystem-based solutions, such as riverine urban areas or technical infrastructure. This paper analyses how flood management has dealt with trade-offs between ecosystem services and practical constrains towards more ecosystem-based solutions. To this end, we study the evolution of flood management in four case studies in the Dutch and German Rhine, the Hungarian Tisza, and the Chinese Yangtze basins during the last decades, focusing on the development and implementation of institutions and their link to ecosystem services. The complexity of human-nature interactions is addressed by exploring the impacts on ecosystem services through the lens of three management paradigms: (1) the control paradigm, (2) the ecosystem-based paradigm, and (3) the stakeholder involvement paradigm. Case study data from expert interviews and a literature search were structured using a database approach prior to qualitative interpretation. Results show the growing importance of the ecosystem-based and stakeholder involvement paradigms which has led to the consideration of a range of regulating and cultural ecosystem services that had previously been neglected. We detected a trend in flood management practice towards the combination of the different paradigms under the umbrella of integrated flood management, which aims at finding the most suitable solution depending on the respective regional conditions.

AB An improved general understanding of riverbed heterogeneity is of importance for all groundwater modeling studies that include river-aquifer interaction processes. Riverbed hydraulic conductivity (K) is one of the main factors controlling river-aquifer exchange fluxes. However, the meter-scale spatial variability of riverbed K has not been adequately mapped as of yet. This study aims to fill this void by combining an extensive field measurement campaign focusing on both horizontal and vertical riverbed K with a detailed geostatistical analysis of the meter-scale spatial variability of riverbed K. In total, 220 slug tests and 45 standpipe tests were performed at two test sites along the Belgian Aa River. Omnidirectional and directional variograms (along and across the river) were calculated. Both horizontal and vertical riverbed K vary over several orders of magnitude and show significant meter-scale spatial variation. Horizontal K shows a bimodal distribution. Elongated zones of high horizontal K along the river course are observed at both sections, indicating a link between riverbed structures, depositional environment and flow regime. Vertical K is lognormally distributed and its spatial variability is mainly governed by the presence and thickness of a low permeable organic layer at the top of the riverbed. The absence of this layer in the center of the river leads to high vertical K and is related to scouring of the riverbed by high discharge events. Variograms of both horizontal and vertical K show a clear directional anisotropy with ranges along the river being twice as large as those across the river. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Most hydrological analysis and modeling studies require reliable and accurate precipitation data for successful simulations. However, precipitation measurements should be more representative of the true precipitation distribution. Many approaches and techniques are used to collect precipitation data. Recently, hydrometeorological and climatological applications of satellite precipitation products have experienced a significant improvement with the emergence of the latest satellite products, namely, the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission (IMERG) products, which can be utilized to estimate and analyze precipitation data. This study focuses on the validation of the IMERG early, late and final run rainfall products using ground-based rain gauge observations throughout Saudi Arabia for the period from October 2015 to April 2016. The accuracy of each IMERG product is assessed using six statistical performance measures to conduct three main evaluations, namely, regional, event-based and station-based evaluations. The results indicate that the early run product performed well in the middle and eastern parts as well as some of the western parts of the country; meanwhile, the satellite estimates for the other parts fluctuated between an overestimation and an underestimation. The late run product showed an improved accuracy over the southern and western parts; however, over the northern and middle parts, it showed relatively high errors. The final run product revealed significantly improved precipitation estimations and successfully obtained higher accuracies over most parts of the country. This study provides an early assessment of the performance of the GPM satellite products over the Middle East. The study findings can be used as a beneficial reference for the future development of the IMERG algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Agricultural irrigation with trans-basin water diversion can effectively relieve the water paucity in arid and semi-arid regions, however, this may be accompanied by eco-environmental problems (e.g., saline soils, rising groundwater levels, water quality problems). The mechanism of soil water movement under irrigation in the unsaturated zone of arid regions is a key scientific problem that should be solved in order to evaluate agricultural water management and further improve current irrigation practices. This study investigated the impact of drip irrigation on soil water movement in the unsaturated zone of a cotton field in an inland arid region (the Karamay Agricultural Development Area), northwest China. Combining in situ observational physical data with temporal variation in stable isotopic compositions of soil water, we described the soil water flow system and mechanism in severe (Plot 1) and mild (Plot 2) saline-alkali cotton fields. The infiltration depths are 0-150 cm for both plots, Drip irrigation scheduling makes no significant contribution to local groundwater recharge, however, groundwater can move into the unsaturated zone through capillary rise during cotton flowering and boll periods. Plot 2 is less prone to having secondary soil salinization than Plot I due to the existence of a middle layer (approximately 100 cm thick), which elongated the distance between the root zone and aquifer. Rise in the water table (approximately 60 cm for Plot 1 and 50 cm for Plot 2) could be caused by lateral groundwater flow instead of vertical infiltration. We estimated the soil water storage changes in the unsaturated zone and proposed a conceptual model for deciphering the movement process of soil water. This study provides a scientific basis for determining the rise of groundwater levels and potential development of saline soils and improving agricultural water management in arid regions.

AB Climate variability and anthropogenic regulations are two interwoven factors in the ecohydrologic system across large basins. Understanding the roles that these two factors play under various hydrologic conditions is of great significance for basin hydrology and sustainable water utilization. In this study, we present an analytical approach based on coupling water balance method and Budyko hypothesis to derive effectiveness coefficients (ECs) of climate change, as a way to disentangle contributions of it and human activities to the variability of river discharges under different hydro-transitional situations. The climate dominated streamflow change (Delta Q(c)) by EC approach was compared with those deduced by the elasticity method and sensitivity index. The results suggest that the EC approach is valid and applicable for hydrologic study at large basin scale. Analyses of various scenarios revealed that contributions of climate change and human activities to river discharge variation differed among the regions of the study area. Over the past several decades, climate change dominated hydro-transitions from dry to wet, while human activities played key roles in the reduction of streamflow during wet to dry periods. Remarkable decline of discharge in upstream was mainly due to human interventions, although climate contributed more to runoff increasing during dry periods in the semi-arid downstream. Induced effectiveness on streamflow changes indicated a contribution ratio of 49% for climate and 51% for human activities at the basin scale from 1956 to 2015. The mathematic derivation based simple approach, together with the case example of temporal segmentation and spatial zoning, could help people understand variation of river discharge with more details at a large basin scale under the background of climate change and human regulations.

SO JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY

   Pumping test
ID HARD-ROCK AQUIFERS; HYDRAULIC TESTS; FLOW; BEHAVIOR
AB The behaviour of transient flow due to pumping in fractured rocks has been studied for at least the past 80 years. Analytical solutions were proposed for solving the issue of a well intersecting and pumping from one vertical, horizontal or inclined fracture in homogeneous aquifers, but their domain of application even if covering various fracture geometries was restricted to isotropic or anisotropic aquifers, whose potential boundaries had to be parallel or orthogonal to the fracture direction. The issue thus remains unsolved for many field cases. For example, a well intersecting and pumping a fracture in a multilayer or a dual-porosity aquifer, where intersected fractures are not necessarily parallel or orthogonal to aquifer boundaries, where several fractures with various orientations intersect the well, or the effect of pumping not only in fractures, but also in the aquifer through the screened interval of the well.
   Using a mathematical demonstration, we show that integrating the well-known Theis analytical solution (Theis, 1935) along the fracture axis is identical to the equally well-known analytical solution of Gringarten et al. (1974) for a uniform-flux fracture fully penetrating a homogeneous aquifer. This result implies that any existing line- or point-source solution can be used for implementing one or more discrete fractures that are intersected by the well. Several theoretical examples are presented and discussed: a single vertical fracture in a dual-porosity aquifer or in a multi-layer system (with a partially intersecting fracture); one and two inclined fractures in a leaky-aquifer system with pumping either only from the fracture(s), or also from the aquifer between fracture(s) in the screened interval of the well. For the cases with several pumping sources, analytical solutions of flowrate contribution from each individual source (fractures and well) are presented, and the drawdown behaviour according to the length of the pumped screened interval of the well is discussed. Other advantages of this proposed generic analytical solution are also given.
   The application of this solution to field data should provide additional field information on fracture geometry, as well as identifying the connectivity between the pumped fractures and other aquifers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a key policy tool, water diplomacy offers greater political engagement in the cooperative management of shared water. A range of initiatives has been dedicated to this end, almost invariably oriented around the interactions of nation states. Crucially, however, practitioners of water diplomacy also need to address water governance at sub-state levels. As a political, multi-level, and normative field, peace and conflict research offers a pluralism of approaches designed to bring actors together at all levels. Drawing upon this research, this paper offers new focal points for water diplomacy that can enhance its policy effectiveness and enrich its underlying academic current. More specifically, it presents three hitherto undervalued tools for water diplomacy: at the interstate level, to uncover the rich body of political norms that bind states to shared understandings of acceptable practice around water. At the intrastate level, to incorporate ethnography of water users and civil society groups' responses to state-led waterworks projects, and at the communal level to employ disaggregated georeferenced data on water resources in conflict-prone areas. Taken together, these analytical tools provide a multi-faceted political gauge of the dynamics of water diplomacy, and add vital impetus to develop water diplomacy across multiple levels of policy engagement.

ID LOCAL-GRID REFINEMENT; SHARED NODES; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS
AB The application of global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis techniques to groundwater models of deep sedimentary basins are typically challenged by large computational burdens combined with associated numerical stability issues. The highly parameterized approaches required for exploring the predictive uncertainty associated with the heterogeneous hydraulic characteristics of multiple aquifers and aquitards in these sedimentary basins exacerbate these issues. A novel Patch Modelling Methodology is proposed for improving the computational feasibility of stochastic modelling analysis of large-scale and complex groundwater models. The method incorporates a nested groundwater modelling framework that enables efficient simulation of groundwater flow and transport across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The method also allows different processes to be simulated within different model scales. Existing nested model methodologies are extended by employing 'joining predictions' for extrapolating prediction-salient information from one model scale to the next. This establishes a feedback mechanism supporting the transfer of information from child models to parent models as well as parent models to child models in a computationally efficient manner. This feedback mechanism is simple and flexible and ensures that while the salient small scale features influencing larger scale prediction are transferred back to the larger scale, this does not require the live coupling of models. This method allows the modelling of multiple groundwater flow and transport processes using separate groundwater models that are built for the appropriate spatial and temporal scales, within a stochastic framework, while also removing the computational burden associated with live model coupling. The utility of the method is demonstrated by application to an actual large scale aquifer injection scheme in Australia. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Rainfall networks are the most direct sources of precipitation data and their optimization and evaluation are essential and important. Information entropy can not only represent the uncertainty of rainfall distribution but can also reflect the correlation and information transmission between rainfall stations. Using entropy this study performs optimization of rainfall networks that are of similar size located in two big cities in China, Shanghai (in Yangtze River basin) and Xi'an (in Yellow River basin), with respect to temporal variability analysis. Through an easy-to-implement greedy ranking algorithm based on the criterion called, Maximum Information Minimum Redundancy (MIMR), stations of the networks in the two areas (each area is further divided into two subareas) are ranked during sliding inter-annual series and under different meteorological conditions. It is found that observation series with different starting days affect the ranking, alluding to the temporal variability during network evaluation. We propose a dynamic network evaluation framework for considering temporal variability, which ranks stations under different starting days with a fixed time window (1-year, 2-year, and 5-year). Therefore, we can identify rainfall stations which are temporarily of importance or redundancy and provide some useful suggestions for decision makers. The proposed framework can serve as a supplement for the primary MIMR optimization approach. In addition, during different periods (wet season or dry season) the optimal network from MIMR exhibits differences in entropy values and the optimal network from wet season tended to produce higher entropy values. Differences in spatial distribution of the optimal networks suggest that optimizing the rainfall network for changing meteorological conditions may be more recommended. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Under the effects of global change, water crisis ranks as the top global risk in the future decade, and water conflict in transboundary river basins as well as the geostrategic competition led by it is most concerned. This study presents an innovative integrated PPMGWO model of water resources optimization allocation in a transboundary river basin, which is integrated through the projection pursuit model (PPM) and Grey wolf optimization (GWO) method. This study uses the Songhua River basin and 25 control units as examples, adopting the PPMGWO model proposed in this study to allocate the water quantity. Using water consumption in all control units in the Songhua River basin in 2015 as reference to compare with optimization allocation results of firefly algorithm (FA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms as well as the PPMGWO model, results indicate that the average difference between corresponding allocation results and reference values are 0.195 bil m(3), 0.151 bil m(3), and 0.085 bil m(3), respectively. Obviously, the average difference of the PPMGWO model is the lowest and its optimization allocation result is closer to reality, which further confirms the reasonability, feasibility, and accuracy of the PPMGWO model. And then the PPMGWO model is adopted to simulate allocation of available water quantity in Songhua River basin in 2018, 2020, and 2030. The simulation results show water quantity which could be allocated in all controls demonstrates an overall increasing trend with reasonable and equal exploitation and utilization of water resources in the Songhua River basin in future. In addition, this study has a certain reference value and application meaning to comprehensive management and water resources allocation in other transboundary river basins. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Wetlands are important ecosystems that provide many ecological benefits, and their quality and presence are protected by federal regulations. These regulations require wetland delineations, which can be costly and time-consuming to perform. Computer models can assist in this process, but lack the accuracy necessary for environmental planning-scale wetland identification. In this study, the potential for improvement of wetland identification models through modification of digital elevation model (DEM) derivatives, derived from high-resolution and increasingly available light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, at a scale necessary for small-scale wetland delineations is evaluated. A novel approach of flow convergence modelling is presented where Topographic Wetness Index (TWI), curvature, and Cartographic Depth-to-Water index (DTW), are modified to better distinguish wetland from upland areas, combined with ancillary soil data, and used in a Random Forest classification. This approach is applied to four study sites in Virginia, implemented as an ArcGIS model. The model resulted in significant improvement in average wetland accuracy compared to the commonly used National Wetland Inventory (84.9% vs. 32.1%), at the expense of a moderately lower average non-wetland accuracy (85.6% vs. 98.0%) and average overall accuracy (85.6% vs. 92.0%). From this, we concluded that modifying TWI, curvature, and DTW provides more robust wetland and non-wetland signatures to the models by improving accuracy rates compared to classifications using the original indices. The resulting ArcGIS model is a general tool able to modify these local LiDAR DEM derivatives based on site characteristics to identify wetlands at a high resolution. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The idea of the Weighted Function (WF) method for estimation of Pearson type 3 (Pe3) distribution introduced by Ma in 1984 has been revised and successfully applied for shifted inverse Gaussian (IGa3) distribution. Also the conditions of WF applicability to a shifted distribution have been formulated.
   The accuracy of WF flood quantiles for both Pe3 and IGa3 distributions was assessed by Monte Caro simulations under the true and false distribution assumption versus the maximum likelihood (MLM), moment (MOM) and L-moments (LMM) methods. Three datasets of annual peak flows of Polish catchments serve the case studies to compare the results of the WF, MOM, MLM and LMM performance for the real flood data. For the hundred-year flood the WF method revealed the explicit superiority only over the MLM surpassing the MOM and especially LMM both for the true and false distributional assumption with respect to relative bias and relative mean root square error values. Generally, the WF method performs well and for hydrological sample size and constitutes good alternative for the estimation of the flood upper quantiles. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Classification and similarity based methods, which have recently received major attention in the field of surface water hydrology, namely through the PUB (prediction in ungauged basins) initiative, have not yet been applied to groundwater systems. However, it can be hypothesised, that the principle of "similar systems responding similarly to similar forcing" applies in subsurface hydrology as well. One fundamental prerequisite to test this hypothesis and eventually to apply the principle to make "predictions for ungauged groundwater systems" is efficient methods to quantify the similarity of groundwater system responses, i.e. groundwater hydrographs. In this study, a large, spatially extensive, as well as geologically and geomorphologically diverse dataset from Southern Germany and Western Austria was used, to test and compare a set of 32 grouping methods, which have previously only been used individually in local scale studies. The resulting groupings are compared to a heuristic visual classification, which serves as a baseline. A performance ranking of these classification methods is carried out and differences in homogeneity of grouping results were shown, whereby selected groups were related to hydrogeological indices and geological descriptors. This exploratory empirical study shows that the choice of grouping method has a large impact on the object distribution within groups, as well as on the homogeneity of patterns captured in groups. The study provides a comprehensive overview of a large number of grouping methods, which can guide researchers when attempting similarity-based groundwater hydrograph classification.

AB Using a moisture tracking model with 32-year reanalysis data and station precipitation observations, we diagnosed the sources of moisture for summer (June 1-August 31) precipitation in mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). Results indicate the dominant role of oceanic evaporation compared to terrestrial evapotranspiration, and the previously overlooked southern Indian Ocean, as a source region, is found to contribute more moisture than the well-known Arabian Sea or Bay of Bengal. Terrestrial evapotranspiration appears to be important for summer precipitation, especially in early June when moisture contribution is more than 50%. The terrestrial contribution then decreases and is generally less than 40% after late June. The Indian Ocean is the most important oceanic source before mid-July, with its largest contribution during the period of heavy precipitation, while the Pacific Ocean becomes the more important oceanic source after mid-July. To quantitatively analyze paths of moisture transport to YRB, we proposed the Trajectory Frequency Method. The most intense branch of water vapor transport to YRB stretches from the Arabian Sea through the Bay of Bengal, the Indochina Peninsula, the South China Sea, and South China. The other main transport branches are westerly moisture fluxes to the south of the Tibetan Plateau, cross-equatorial flows north of Australia, and separate branches located in the north and equatorial Pacific Ocean. Significant intraseasonal variability for these branches is presented. Additionally, the importance of the South China Sea for moisture transport to YRB, especially from the sea areas, is emphasized.

AB This study uses daily rainfall records of a dense network of 240 gauges in central Arizona to gain insights on (i) the variability of the seasonal distributions of rainfall extremes; (ii) how the seasonal distributions affect the shape of the annual distribution; and (iii) the presence of spatial patterns and orographic control for these distributions. For this aim, recent methodological advancements in peak-over-threshold analysis and application of the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) were used to assess the suitability of the GPD hypothesis and improve the estimation of its parameters, while limiting the effect of short sample sizes. The distribution of daily rainfall extremes was found to be heavy-tailed (i.e., GPD shape parameter xi > 0) during the summer season, dominated by convective monsoonal thunderstorms. The exponential distribution (a special case of GPD with xi = 0) was instead showed to be appropriate for modeling wintertime daily rainfall extremes, mainly caused by cold fronts transported by westerly flow. The annual distribution exhibited a mixed behavior, with lighter upper tails than those found in summer. A hybrid model mixing the two seasonal distributions was demonstrated capable of reproducing the annual distribution. Organized spatial patterns, mainly controlled by elevation, were observed for the GPD scale parameter, while xi did not show any clear control of location or orography. The quantiles returned by the GPD were found to be very similar to those provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Atlas 14, which used the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. Results of this work are useful to improve statistical modeling of daily rainfall extremes at high spatial resolution and provide diagnostic tools for assessing the ability of climate models to simulate extreme events.

AB As sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, integrated urban drainage systems (IUDSs) (i.e., sewer systems, wastewater treatment plants and receiving water bodies) contribute to climate change. This paper, produced by the International Working Group on Data and Models, which works under the IWA/IAHR Joint Committee on Urban Drainage, reviews the state-of-the-art and modelling tools developed recently to understand and manage GHG emissions from IUDS. Further, open problems and research gaps are discussed and a framework for handling GHG emissions from IUDSs is presented. The literature review reveals that there is a need to strengthen already available mathematical models for IUDS to take GHG into account. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Knowledge about the hydrological regime of wetlands is key to understand their physical and biological properties. Modelling hydrological and hydrodynamic processes within a wetland is therefore becoming increasingly important. 3D models have successfully modelled wetland dynamics but depend on very detailed bathymetry and land topography. Many 1D and 2D models of river deltas highly simplify the interaction between the river and wetland area or simply neglect the wetland area. This study proposes an enhanced quasi-2D modelling strategy that captures the interaction between river discharge and moon tides and the resulting hydrodynamics, while using the scarce data available. The water flow equations are discretised with an interconnected irregular cell scheme, in which a simplification of the 1D Saint-Venant equations is used to define the water flow between cells. The spatial structure of wetlands is based on the ecogeomorphology in complex estuarine deltas. The islands within the delta are modelled with levee cells, creek cells and an interior cell representing a shallow marsh wetland. The model is calibrated for an average year and the model performance is evaluated for another average year and additionally an extreme dry three-month period and an extreme wet three-month period. The calibration and evaluation are done based on two water level measurement stations and two discharge measurement stations, all located in the main rivers. Additional calibration is carried out with field water level measurements in a wetland area. Accurate simulations are obtained for both calibration and evaluation with high correlations between observed and simulated water levels and simulated discharges in the same order of magnitude as observed discharges. Calibration against field measurements showed that the model can successfully simulate the overflow mechanism in wetland areas. A sensitivity analysis for several wetland parameters showed that these parameters are all influencing the water level fluctuation within the wetlands to varying degrees. The enhanced quasi-2D model has the potential to accurately simulate river and wetland dynamics for large wetland areas and help to understand their hydrodynamics. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Multi-objective hydrological model calibration can represent a valuable solution to reduce model equifinality and parameter uncertainty. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is widely applied to investigate water quality and water management issues in alpine catchments. However, the model calibration is generally based on discharge records only, and most of the previous studies have defined a unique set of snow parameters for an entire basin. Only a few studies have considered snow observations to validate model results or have taken into account the possible variability of snow parameters for different subbasins. This work presents and compares three possible calibration approaches. The first two procedures are single-objective calibration procedures, for which all parameters of the SWAT model were calibrated according to river discharge alone. Procedures I and II differ from each other by the assumption used to define snow parameters: The first approach assigned a unique set of snow parameters to the entire basin, whereas the second approach assigned different subbasin-specific sets of snow parameters to each subbasin. The third procedure is a multi-objective calibration, in which we considered snow water equivalent (SWE) information at two different spatial scales (i.e. subbasin and elevation band), in addition to discharge measurements. We tested these approaches in the Upper Adige river basin where a dense network of snow depth measurement stations is available. Only the set of parameters obtained with this multi-objective procedure provided an acceptable prediction of both river discharge and SWE. These findings offer the large community of SWAT users a strategy to improve SWAT modeling in alpine catchments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A quantitative framework for characterizing the intensity of the water cycle over land is presented, and illustrated using a spatially distributed water-balance model of the conterminous United States (CONUS). We approach water cycle intensity (WCI) from a landscape perspective; WCI is defined as the sum of precipitation (P) and actual evapotranspiration (AET) over a spatially explicit landscape unit of interest, averaged over a specified time period (step) of interest. The time step may be of any length for which data or simulation results are available (e.g., sub-daily to multi-decadal). We define the storage-adjusted runoff (Q') as the sum of actual runoff (Q) and the rate of change in soil moisture storage (Delta S/Delta t, positive or negative) during the time step of interest. The Q' indicator is demonstrated to be mathematically complementary to WCI, in a manner that allows graphical interpretation of their relationship. For the purposes of this study, the indicators were demonstrated using long-term, spatially distributed model simulations with an annual time step. WCI was found to increase over most of the CONUS between the 1945 to 1974 and 1985 to 2014 periods, driven primarily by increases in P. In portions of the western and southeastern CONUS, Q decreased because of decreases in Q and soil moisture storage. Analysis of WCI and Q at temporal scales ranging from sub-daily to multi-decadal could improve understanding of the wide spectrum of hydrologic responses that have been attributed to water cycle intensification, as well as trends in those responses.

AB Nitrate contamination of groundwater in agricultural areas poses a major challenge to the sustainability of water resources. Aquifer vulnerability models are useful tools that can help resource managers identify areas of concern, but quantifying nitrogen (N) inputs in such models is challenging, especially at large spatial scales. We sought to improve regional nitrate (NO3-) input functions by characterizing unsaturated zone NO3- transport to groundwater through use of surrogate, machine-learning metamodels of a process-based N flux model. The metamodels used boosted regression trees (BRTs) to relate mappable landscape variables to parameters and outputs of a previous "vertical flux method" (VFM) applied at sampled wells in the Fox, Wolf, and Peshtigo (FWP) river basins in northeastern Wisconsin. In this context, the metamodels upscaled the VFM results throughout the region, and the VFM parameters and outputs are the metamodel response variables. The study area encompassed the domain of a detailed numerical model that provided additional predictor variables, including groundwater recharge, to the metamodels. We used a statistical learning framework to test a range of model complexities to identify suitable hyperparameters of the six BRT meta models corresponding to each response variable of interest: NO source concentration factor (which determines the local NO input concentration); unsaturated zone travel time; NO3- concentration at the water table in 1980, 2000, and 2020 (three separate metamodels); and NO3- "extinction depth", the eventual steady state depth of the NO3- front. The final metamodels were trained to 129 wells within the active numerical flow model area, and considered 58 mappable predictor variables compiled in a geographic information system (GIS). These metamodels had training and cross-validation testing R-2 values of 0.52-0.86 and 0.22-0.38, respectively, and predictions were compiled as maps of the above response variables. Testing performance was reasonable, considering that we limited the metamodel predictor variables to mappable factors as opposed to using all available VFM input variables. Relationships between metamodel predictor variables and mapped outputs were generally consistent with expectations, e.g. with greater source concentrations and NO3- at the groundwater table in areas of intensive crop use and well drained soils. Shorter unsaturated zone travel times in poorly drained areas likely indicated preferential flow through clay soils, and a tendency for fine grained deposits to collocate with areas of shallower water table. Numerical estimates of groundwater recharge were important in the metamodels and may have been a proxy for N input and redox conditions in the northern FWP, which had shallow predicted NO3- extinction depth. The metamodel results provide proof-of-concept for regional characterization of unsaturated zone NO3- transport processes in a statistical framework based on readily mappable GIS input variables.

AB Reaction-infiltration instability, in which chemical reactions can dissolve minerals and therefore create preferential pore-fluid flow channels in fluid-saturated rocks, may play an important role in controlling groundwater quality in groundwater hydrology. Although this topic has been studied for many years, there is a recent debate, which says that the use of large-density asymptotics in the previous studies is invalid. However, there is a crucial conceptual mistake in this debate, which leads to results and conclusions that are inconsistent with the fundamental laws of physics. It is well known that in terms of distance, time and velocity, there are only two independent variables. But they are treated as three independent variables, a procedure that is the main source of the physically unrealistic results and conclusions in the debate. In this paper, we will discuss the results and conclusions related to the debate, with emphasis on the issues leading to the corresponding errors. In particular, we demonstrate that there is an unappreciated constraint condition between the dimensional/dimensionless distance, time and velocity in the debate. By using this constraint condition, it can be confirmed that as the ratio of the reactant concentration in the incoming fluid stream to the mineral concentration approaches zero, the dimensionless transport parameter, H, automatically approaches infinity. Therefore, it is further confirmed that the previous work conducted by Chadam and others remains valid. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillation indexes on the constructed prediction intervals are also examined. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated for the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) obtained from Konya closed basin located in Central Anatolia, Turkey. The finite sample properties of the proposed method are further illustrated by an extensive simulation study.

AB As the only connecting term between water balance and energy budget in the earth-atmospheric system, evapotranspiration (ET) is considered the most excellent indicator for the activity for the water and energy cycle. Under the background of global change, regional ET estimates, components partitioning as well as their spatial and temporal patterns recognition are of great importance in understanding the hydrological processes and improving water management practices. This is particularly true for the Tibetan Plateau (TP), one of most sensitive and vulnerable region in response to the environment change in the earth. In this study, with flux site observation data and monthly ET data from the monthly water balance method incorporating the terrestrial water storage changes from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite (GRACE) production as the multiple validations, the long-term daily ET in the TP was retrieved by a modified Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) model with considering evapotranspiration over snow covered area during 1982-2012. The spatial and temporal changes of partitioned three components of ET, i.e., soil evaporation (E-s), transpiration through the stomata of plant (Er) and canopy interception (E-i), were investigated in the TP. Meanwhile, how the ET components contribute to ET changes and respond to the change in environmental factors in the TP was revealed and discussed. The results indicate that E-s dominates ET in most areas of the TP with the mean annual ratio of 65.7%, except southeastern regions where the vegetation coverage is high. Although regional average ET and three main components all present obvious increase trends during the past decades, high spatial heterogeneity for their trends are identified in the TP. Moreover, a mixed changing pattern can be apparently found for E-s in southeastern area, E-c and E-i in northwestern and southeastern area. Spatially, the ET variation are mainly attributed to change in E-s, followed by E-c and E-i. In addition, compared with evaporation related meteorological variables, precipitation and leaf area index (LAI) provide the more dominated contributions to the changes of ET and E-i in the TP, while LAI is overwhelming contribution factor for E-c changes. As for E-s changes, although precipitation play the important role, the effects of other factors are also non-negligible. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Mismanagement has caused the overexploitation of one third of the major aquifers in Mexico, mainly due to excessive water extraction for agricultural irrigation. Santo Domingo (Baja California Sur, in northern Mexico, where agriculture absorbs nearly 80% of water) is the only aquifer in the Mexico where, after a period of overexploitation, equality between extraction and recharge rates was achieved, although this has not meant the securement of long-term water availability. This paper offers an analysis of hydrological resilience of a water-limited arid ecosystem under future extraction scenarios and changing climate conditions. A regional groundwater flow model is proposed using MODFLOW software. Then, different indicators were modeled as outcomes of coupled human-water systems to predict water trajectories under different human impacts. The aim was to recognize water insecurity scenarios and define appropriate actions to a more sustainable use of this scarce resource in the region. Thus, although runoff derived from extreme floods may favor infiltration, the involvement of local stakeholders and decision makers to reverse the adverse impacts of current water management and climate change is imperative if water availability and better quality are to be secured.

AB To understand the characteristics of Ca isotope composition and fractionation in silicate-dominated Quaternary aquifer system, hydrochemical and isotope studies (Sr-87/Sr-86, C-13(DIC) and Ca-44/40) were conducted on groundwater, sediment and rock samples from the Datong basin, China. Along the groundwater flow path from the basin margin to the center, groundwater hydrochemical type evolves from Ca-HCO3 to Na-HCO3/Na-Cl type, which results from aluminosilicate hydrolysis, vertical mixing, cation exchange between CaX2 and NaX, and calcite/dolomite precipitation. These processes cause the decrease in groundwater Ca concentration and the associated modest fractionation of groundwater Ca isotopes along the flowpath. The groundwater delta Ca-44/40 value varies from -0.11 to 0.49%, The elevated delta Ca-44/40 ratios in shallow groundwater are attributed to vertical mixing involving addition of irrigation water, which had the average delta Ca-44/40 ratio of 0.595 parts per thousand.. Chemical weathering of silicate minerals and carbonate generates depleted delta Ca-44/40 signatures in groundwater from Heng Mountain (east area) and Huanghua Uplift (west area), respectively. Along the groundwater flow path from Heng Mountain to central area of east area, cation exchange between CaX2 and NaX on clay mineral results in the enrichment of heavier Ca isotope in groundwater. All groundwater samples are oversaturated with respect to calcite and dolomite. The groundwater environment rich in organic matter promotes the precipitation of carbonate minerals via the biodegradation of organic carbon, thereby further promoting the elevation of groundwater delta Ca-44/40 ratios.

AB In coupled sewer and surface flood modelling approaches, the flow process in gullies is often ignored although the overland flow is drained to sewer network via inlets and gullies. Therefore, the flow entering inlets is transferred to the sewer network immediately, which may lead to a different flood estimation than the reality. In this paper, we compared two modelling approach with and without considering the flow processes in gullies in the coupled sewer and surface modelling. Three historical flood events were adopted for model calibration and validation. The results showed that the inclusion of flow process in gullies can further improve the accuracy of urban flood modelling. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a brief review of the physics-based formulations to estimate t(SHF) including kinematic wave (K-W) theory in combination with Manning's roughness (K-M) and with Darcy-Weisbach friction formula (K-D) over single and multiple planes is provided. Then, the relative significance of input parameters to the developed approaches is quantified by a density-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The performance of K-M considering zero-upstream and uniform flow depth (so-called K-M1 and K-M2), and K-D formulae to estimate the t(SHF) over single plane surface were assessed using several sets of experimental data collected from the previous studies. The compatibility of the developed models to estimate t(SHF) over multiple planes considering temporal rainfall distributions of Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS (I, Ia, II, and III) are scrutinized by several real-world examples. The results obtained demonstrated that the main controlling parameters of t(SHF) through K-D and K-M formulae are the length of surface plane (mean sensitivity index (T) over cap (i) = 0.72) and flow resistance (mean (T) over cap (i) = 0.52), respectively. Conversely, the flow temperature and initial abstraction ratio of rainfall have the lowest influence on t(SHF) (mean (T) over cap (i) is 0.11 and 0.12, respectively). The significant role of the flow regime on the estimation of t(SHF) over a single and a cascade of planes are also demonstrated. Results reveal that the K-D formulation provides more precise t(SHF) over the single plane surface with an average percentage of error, APE equal to 9.23% (the APE for K-M1 and K-M2 formulae were 13.8%, and 36.33%, respectively). The superiority of Manning-jointed formulae in estimation of t(SHF) is due to the incorporation of effects from different flow regimes as flow moves downgradient that is affected by one or more factors including high excess rainfall intensities, low flow resistance, high degrees of imperviousness, long surfaces, steep slope, and domination of rainfall distribution as NRCS Type I, II, or III.

AB Changes in the stable isotope composition of water can, with the aid of climatic parameters, be used to calculate the quantity of evaporation from a water body. Previous workers have mostly focused on small, research catchments, with abundant data, but of limited scope. This study aimed to expand such work to a regional or sub-continental scale. The first full length isotope survey of the Gariep River quantifies evaporation on the river and the man-made reservoirs for the first time, and proposes a technique to calculate abstraction from the river. The theoretically determined final isotope composition for an evaporating water body in the given climate lies on the empirically determined local evaporation line, validating the assumptions and inputs to the Craig-Gordon evaporation model that was used. Evaporation from the Gariep River amounts to around 20% of flow, or 40 m(3)/s, of which about half is due to evaporation from the surface of the Gariep and Vanderkloof Reservoirs, showing the wastefulness of large surface water impoundments. This compares well with previous estimates based on evapotranspiration calculations, and equates to around 1300 GL/a of water, or about the annual water consumption of Johannesburg and Pretoria, where over 10 million people reside. Using similar evaporation calculations and applying existing transpiration estimates to a gauged length of river, the remaining quantity can be attributed to abstraction, amounting to 175 L/s/km in the lower middle reaches of the river. Given that high water demand and climate change are global problems, and with the challenges of maintaining water monitoring networks, stable isotopes are shown to be applicable over regional to national scales for modelling hydrological flows. Stable isotopes provide a complementary method to conventional flow gauging for understanding hydrology and management of large water resources, particularly in arid areas subject to significant evaporation.

AB The paper investigates the applicability of Kinematic and Diffusive Wave models for mud-flows with a power-law shear-thinning rheology. In analogy with a well-known approach for turbulent clear-water flows, the study compares the steady flow depth profiles predicted by approximated models with those of the Full Dynamic Wave one. For all the models and assuming an infinitely wide channel, the analytical solution of the flow depth profiles, in terms of hypergeometric functions, is derived. The accuracy of the approximated models is assessed by computing the average, along the channel length, of the errors, for several values of the Froude and kinematic wave numbers. Assuming the threshold value of the error equal to 5%, the applicability conditions of the two approximations have been individuated for several values of the power-law exponent, showing a crucial role of the rheology. The comparison with the clear-water results indicates that applicability criteria for clear-water flows do not apply to shear thinning fluids, potentially leading to an incorrect use of approximated models if the rheology is not properly accounted for.

AB Nineteen private wells were investigated in order to evaluate the groundwater quality and the issues associated with well water use in a fractured metasedimentary aquifer of the Canadian Shield, in western Quebec (Canada). Groundwater sampling and analysis reveal that the quality of well water is both a potential aesthetic and health concern for the residents. Aesthetic problems are mainly related to the high levels of hardness and dissolved iron and manganese. Potential health risks are associated with the occurrence of brackish groundwater, high manganese concentrations, and arsenic concentrations exceeding the Canadian guideline value of 10 mu g/I. Brackish groundwater is suspected to be derived from the mixing of fresh groundwaters with deep calcium-sodium-chloride brines of the Canadian Shield. The occurrences of iron, manganese and arsenic, primarily derived from the natural weathering of bedrock, are highly dependent on the geochemical conditions in groundwater, particularly the redox potential. Arsenic occurs mainly as arsenite (As(III)) and is thought to be released by the dissolution of iron and manganese oxyhydroxides under reducing conditions. Information obtained from well owners indicates that most households use ion exchange water softeners to minimize aesthetic problems of excessive hardness and dissolved iron and manganese concentrations. Homeowners generally take protective measures to reduce their exposure to arsenic when they are aware of the contamination. The exposure to arsenic and manganese may pose health risks for residents that do not take protective measures. The quality of well water is of paramount importance for human health in rural areas. Information on the contaminant sources and individual mitigation measures is essential to assess the health risks associated with groundwater consumption and to ensure the protection of public health.

AB The upcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission, to be launched in 2021, will measure river water surface elevation, slope and width, with an unprecedented level of accuracy for a remote sensing tool. This work investigates the river discharge estimation from synthetic SWOT observations, in the presence of strong uncertainties in the model inputs, i.e. the river bathymetry and bed roughness. The estimation problem is solved by a novel variant of the standard variational data assimilation, the '4D-Var' method, involving the full Saint-Venant 1.5D-network hydraulic model SIC2. The assimilation scheme simultaneously estimates the discharge, bed elevation and bed roughness coefficient and is designed to assimilate both satellite and in situ measurements. The method is tested on a 50 km-long reach of the Garonne River during a five-month period of the year 2010, characterized by multiple flooding events. First, the impact of the sampling frequency on discharge estimation is investigated. Secondly, discharge as well as the spatially distributed bed elevation and bed roughness coefficient are determined simultaneously. Results demonstrate feasibility and efficiency of the chosen combination of the estimation method and of the hydraulic model. Assimilation of the SWOT data results into an accurate estimation of the discharge at observation times, and a local improvement in the bed level and bed roughness coefficient. However, the latter estimates are not generally usable for different independent experiments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Increasing urbanization augments impervious surface area, which results in increased run off volumes and peak flows. Green Infrastructure (GI) approaches are a decentralized alternative for sustainable urban stormwater and provide an array of ecosystem services and foster community building by enhancing neighborhood aesthetics, increasing property value, and providing shared green spaces. While projects involving sustainability concepts and environmental design are favored in privileged communities, marginalized communities have historically been located in areas that suffer from environmental degradation. Underprivileged communities typically do not receive as many social and environmental services as advantaged communities. This research explores GI-based management strategies that are evaluated at the watershed scale to improve hydrological performance by mitigating storm water run off volumes and peak flows. GI deployment strategies are developed to address environmental justice issues by prioritizing placement in communities that are underprivileged and locations with high outreach potential. A hydrologic/hydraulic stormwater model is developed using the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM 5.1) to simulate the impacts of alternative management strategies. Management scenarios include the implementation of rain water harvesting in private households, the decentralized implementation of bioretention cells in private households, the centralized implementation of bioretention cells in municipally owned vacant land, and combinations of those strategies. Realities of implementing Cl on private and public lands are taken into account to simulate various levels of coverage and routing for bioretention cell scenarios. The effects of these strategies are measured by the volumetric reduction of run off and reduction in peak flow; social benefits are not evaluated. This approach is applied in an underprivileged community within the Walnut Creek Watershed in Raleigh, North Carolina. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is nowadays widely considered to have major effects on groundwater resources. Climatic projections suggest a global increase in evaporation and higher frequency of strong rainfall events especially in Mediterranean context. Since evaporation is synonym of low recharge conditions whereas strong rainfall events are more favourable to recharge in heterogeneous subsurface contexts, a lack of knowledge remains then on the real ongoing and future drinking groundwater supply availability at aquifers scale. Due to low recharge potential and high inter-annual climate variability, this issue is strategic for the Mediterranean hydrosystems. This is especially the case for coastal aquifers because they are exposed to seawater intrusion, sea-level rise and overpumping risks. In this context, recharge processes and rates were investigated in a Mediterranean coastal aquifer with subsurface heterogeneity located in Southern Corsica (France), Aquifer recharge rates from combining ten physical and chemical methods were computed. In addition, hydrochemical and isotopic investigations were carried out through a monthly two years monitoring combining major ions and stable isotopes of water in rain, runoff and groundwater. Diffuse, focused, lateral mountain system and irrigation recharge processes were identified and characterized. A predominant focused recharge conditioned by subsurface heterogeneity is evidenced in agreement with variable but highly favourable recharge rates. The fast water transfer from the surface to the aquifer implied by this recharge process suggests less evaporation, which means higher groundwater renewal and availability in such Mediterranean coastal aquifers.

AB Climate change will be particularly experienced though the medium of water. Water organisations, that are managing societal and ecological needs for water, are therefore likely to experience the impact the most. This study reviews the current literature regarding adaptation to climate change by water management organisations and associated barriers.
   Literature on adaptive capacity is growing and a general consensus is emerging on the determinants of adaptive capacity, although variations exist regarding how it is to be evaluated, enhanced and applied to policy making due to its dynamic, contextual and latent nature. Since adaptive capacity is hard to measure and successful adaptation difficult to define, some studies focus on the existence of adaptation attributes of organisations. Studies reporting successful adaptation are minimal and barriers of adaptation are being discovered as adaptation research transitions into implementation. But the root causes of these barriers are often overlooked and the interconnectedness of the barriers is poorly addressed.
   Increasingly, combining top-down and bottom-up approaches to adaptation is being recommended due to the limitations of each. However, knowledge regarding how organisations operating at different scales can enhance adaptive capacity of other organisations operating at another scale is lacking due to the few studies of inter-organisational networks across scales. Social networks among actors are recognised as a key factor to enable adaptation. However, network studies generally focus on individual actors and rarely between public agencies/organisations. Moreover, the current literature is inadequate to understand the relationship between adaptation enabling characteristics, barriers and adaptation manifestation. The review demonstrates that research on understanding the emergence and sustenance of barriers is urgently required. Addressing these knowledge gaps will help to improve the design of adaptation strategies, thereby improving the ability of water management to address the ongoing challenges of climate change.

AB Understanding the processes controlling nutrient delivery in headwater agricultural watersheds is essential for predicting and mitigating eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in receiving surface waters. The objective of this study was to elucidate nutrient transport pathways and examine key components driving nutrient delivery processes during storm events in four nested agricultural watersheds (298-19,341 ha) in the western Lake Erie basin with poorly drained soils and an extensive artificial drainage network typical of the Midwestern U.S. Concentration-discharge hysteresis patterns of nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), and particulate phosphorus (PP) occurring during 47 storm events over a 6 year period (2004-2009) were evaluated. An assessment of the factors producing nutrient hysteresis was completed following a factor analysis on a suite of measured environmental variables representing the fluvial and wider watershed conditions prior to, and during the monitored storm events. Results showed the artificial drainage network (i.e., surface tile inlets and subsurface tile drains) in these watersheds was the primary flow pathway for nutrient delivery to streams, but nutrient behavior and export during storm events was regulated by the flow paths to and the intensity of the drainage network, the availability of nutrients, and the relative contributions of upland and in-stream nutrient sources. Potential sources and flow pathways for transport varied among NO3-N, PP, and DRP with results underscoring the challenge of mitigating nutrient loss in these watersheds. Conservation practices addressing both nutrient management and hydrologic connectivity will likely be required to decrease nutrient loss in artificially drained landscapes. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Check dams are one of the most common strategies for controlling sediment transport in erosion prone areas, along with soil and water conservation measures. However, existing mathematical models that simulate sediment production and delivery are often unable to simulate how the storage capacity of check dams varies with time. To explicitly account for this process-and to support the design of check dam systems-we developed a modelling framework consisting of two components, namely (1) the spatially distributed Soil Erosion and Sediment Delivery Model (WaTEM/SEDEM), and (2) a network-based model of check dam storage dynamics. The two models are run sequentially, with the second model receiving the initial sediment input to check dams from WaTEM/SEDEM. The framework is first applied to Shejiagou catchment, a 4.26 km(2) area located in the Loess Plateau, China, where we study the effect of the existing check dam system on sediment dynamics. Results show that the deployment of check dams altered significantly the sediment delivery ratio of the catchment. Furthermore, the network-based model reveals a large variability in the life expectancy of check dams and abrupt changes in their filling rates. The application of the framework to six alternative check dam deployment scenarios is then used to illustrate its usefulness for planning purposes, and to derive some insights on the effect of key decision variables, such as the number, size, and site location of check dams. Simulation results suggest that better performance-in terms of life expectancy and sediment delivery ratio-could have been achieved with an alternative deployment strategy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The rapid urbanization and industrialization in developing countries have increased pollution by heavy metals, which is a concern for human health and the environment. In this study, according to the data obtained from the monitoring stations in the Songhua River basin, the multivariate statistical analysis methods are applied to the hydrological data of the Songhua River basin in order to examine the relation between human activities and the spatio-temporal change of heavy metals (Pb and Cu) in water. By comparing the concentrations at different flow periods, the minimum Pb concentrations are found to have occurred most frequently in low flow periods while the maximum values mostly appeared in average flow periods. Moreover, the minimum Cu concentration in the water frequently occurred in high flow periods. The results show there are low Pb and Cu concentrations in upstream and downstream sections and high concentrations in mid-stream sections, and high concentrations are most frequently measured in the sections of Ashihe' downstream and estuary. Moreover, we have predicted the future (during 2018-2025) trend of the change for the heavy metals pollution in the rivers. The results demonstrated intense human activities are the most important factor causing jump features of typical heavy metal pollution in the different periods for different sections of this study area. The research would provide decision-making and planning for the Songhua River basin during the period of China's 13th Five-Year Plan. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Evapotranspiration (ET) is considered as a key factor in hydrological and climatological studies, agricultural water management, irrigation scheduling, etc. It can be directly measured using lysimeters. Moreover, other methods such as empirical equations and artificial intelligence methods can be used to model ET. In the recent years, artificial intelligence methods have been widely utilized to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ETo). In the present study, local and external performances of multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) and gene expression programming (GEP) were assessed for estimating daily ETo. For this aim, daily weather data of six stations with different climates in Iran, namely Urmia and Tabriz (semi-arid), Isfahan and Shiraz (arid), Yazd and Zahedan (hyper-arid) were employed during 2000-2014. Two types of input patterns consisting of weather data-based and lagged EL data-based scenarios were considered to develop the models. Four statistical indicators including root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to check the accuracy of models. The local performance of models revealed that the MARS and GEP approaches have the capability to estimate daily ETo using the meteorological parameters and the lagged ETo data as inputs. Nevertheless, the MARS had the best performance in the weather data-based scenarios. On the other hand, considerable differences were not observed in the models' accuracy for the lagged ET data-based scenarios. In the innovation of this study, novel hybrid models were proposed in the lagged ETo data-based scenarios through combination of MARS and GEP models with autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) time series model. It was concluded that the proposed novel models named MARS-ARCH and GEP-ARCH improved the performance of ETo modeling compared to the single MARS and GEP. In addition, the external analysis of the performance of models at stations with similar climatic conditions denoted the applicability of nearby station' data for estimation of the daily ETo at target station.

AB River channel drying caused by intermittent stream flow is a widely-recognized factor shaping stream ecosystems. There is a strong need to quantify the distribution of intermittent streams across catchments to inform management. However, observational gauge networks provide only point estimates of stream flow variation. Increasingly, this limitation is being overcome through the use of spatially contiguous estimates of the terrestrial water-balance, which can also assist in estimating runoff and streamfiow at large-spatial scales. Here we proposed an approach to quantifying spatial and temporal variation in monthly flow intermittency throughout river networks in eastern Australia. We aggregated gridded (5 x 5 km) monthly water-balance data with a hierarchically nested catchment dataset to simulate catchment runoff accumulation throughout river networks from 1900 to 2016. We also predicted zero flow duration for the entire river network by developing a robust predictive model relating measured zero flow duration (% months) to environmental predictor variables (based on 43 stream gauges). We then combined these datasets by using the predicted zero flow duration from the regression model to determine appropriate 'zero' flow thresholds for the modelled discharge data, which varied spatially across the catchments examined. Finally, based on modelled discharge data and identified actual zero flow thresholds, we derived summary metrics describing flow intermittency across the catchment (mean flow duration and coefficient-of-variation in flow permanence from 1900 to 2016). We also classified the relative degree of flow intermittency annually to characterise temporal variation in flow intermittency. Results showed that the degree of flow intermittency varied substantially across streams in eastern Australia, ranging from perennial streams flowing permanently (11-12 months) to strongly intermittent streams flowing 4 months or less of year. Results also showed that the temporal extent of flow intermittency varied dramatically inter-annually from 1900 to 2016, with the proportion of intermittent (weakly and strongly intermittent) streams ranging in length from 3% to nearly 100% of the river network, but there was no evidence of an increasing trend towards flow intermittency over this period. Our approach to generating spatially explicit and catchment-wide estimates of streamfiow intermittency can facilitate improved ecological understanding and management of intermittent streams in Australia and around the world.

AB Semi-analytical solutions are presented for flow to a well in an extensive homogeneous and anisotropic unconfined-fractured aquifer system separated by an aquitard. The pumping well is of infinitesimal radius and screened in either the overlying unconfined aquifer or the underlying fractured aquifer. An existing linearization method was used to determine the watertable drainage. The solution was obtained via Laplace and Hankel transforms, with results calculated by numerical inversion. The main findings are presented in the form of non-dimensional drawdown-time curves, as well as scaled sensitivity dimensionless time curves. The new solution permits determination of the influence of fractures, matrix blocks and watertable drainage parameters on the aquifer drawdown. The effect of the aquitard on the drawdown response of the overlying unconfined aquifer and the underlying fractured aquifer was also explored. The results permit estimation of the unconfined and fractured aquifer hydraulic parameters via type-curve matching or coupling of the solution with a parameter estimation code. The solution can also be used to determine aquifer hydraulic properties from an optimal pumping test set up and duration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID SHALLOW-WATER EQUATIONS; SCHEME
AB The traditional Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) scheme has been proven to be incapable of modelling trans-critical flows. Its inherent lack of shock-capturing capability often results in spurious oscillations and computational instabilities. However, the ADI scheme is still widely adopted in flood modelling software, and various special treatments have been designed to stabilise the computation. Modification of the Boussinesq coefficient to adjust the amount of fluid inertia is a numerical treatment that allows the ADI scheme to be applicable to rapid flows. This study comprehensively examines the impact of this numerical treatment over a range of flow conditions. A shock-capturing TVD-MacCormack model is used to provide reference results. For unsteady flows over a frictionless bed, such as idealised dam-break floods, the results suggest that an increase in the value of the Boussinesq coefficient reduces the amplitude of the spurious oscillations. The opposite is observed for steady rapid flows over a frictional bed. Finally, a two-dimensional urban flooding phenomenon is presented, involving unsteady flow over a frictional bed. The results show that increasing the value of the Boussinesq coefficient can significantly reduce the numerical oscillations and reduce the predicted area of inundation. In order to stabilise the ADI computations, the Boussinesq coefficient could be judiciously raised or lowered depending on whether the rapid flow is steady or unsteady and whether the bed is frictional or frictionless. An increase in the Boussinesq coefficient generally leads to overprediction of the propagating speed of the flood wave over a frictionless bed, but the opposite is true when bed friction is significant.

AB Past studies modeling stream-aquifer interaction commonly account for vertical anisotropy in hydraulic conductivity, but rarely address horizontal anisotropy, which may exist in certain sedimentary environments. If present, horizontal anisotropy will greatly impact stream depletion and the amount of recharge a pumped aquifer captures from the river. This scenario requires a different and somewhat more sophisticated mathematical approach to model and interpret pumping test results than previous models used to describe captured recharge from rivers. In this study, a new mathematical model is developed to describe the spatiotemporal distribution of drawdown from stream-bank pumping with a well screened across a horizontally anisotropic, confined aquifer, laterally bounded by a river. This new model is used to estimate four aquifer parameters including the magnitude and directions of major and minor principal transmissivities and storativity based on the observed drawdown-time curves within a minimum of three non-collinear observation wells. In order to approve the efficacy of the new model, a MATLAB script file is programmed to conduct a four-parameter inversion to estimate the four parameters of concern. By comparing the results of analytical and numerical inversions, the accuracy of estimated results from both inversions is acceptable, but the MATLAB program sometimes becomes problematic because of the difficulty of separating the local minima from the global minima. It appears that the new analytical model of this study is applicable and robust in estimating parameter values for a horizontally anisotropic aquifer laterally bounded by a stream. Besides that, the new model calculates stream depletion rate as a function of stream-bank pumping. Unique to horizontally anisotropic and homogeneous aquifers, the stream depletion rate at any given pumping rate depends closely on the horizontal anisotropy ratio and the direction of the principle transmissivities relative to the stream-bank.

AB Better understanding of the dynamics of hydrological connectivity between river and floodplain is essential for the ecological integrity of river systems. In this study, we proposed a regime-switch modelling (RSM) framework, which integrates change point analysis with dynamic linear regression, to detect and date change points in linear regression, and to quantify the relative importance of natural variations and anthropogenic disturbances. The approach was applied to the long-term hydrological time series to investigate the evolution of river-floodplain relation in Dongting Lake in the last five decades, during which the Yangtze River system experienced unprecedented anthropogenic manipulations. Our results suggested that 1) there were five distinct regimes during which the influence of inflows and local climate on lake water level changed significantly. The detected change points were well corresponding to the major events occurred upon the Yangtze; 2) although the importance of inflows from the Yangtze was greater than that of the tributaries flows over the five regimes, the relative contribution gradually decreased from regime 1 to regime 5. The weakening of hydrological forcing from the Yangtze was mainly attributed to the reduction in channel capacity resulting from sedimentation in the outfalls and water level dropping caused by river bed scour in the mainstream; 3) the effects of local climate was much smaller than these of inflows; and 4) since the operation of The Three Gorges Dam in 2006, the river-floodplain relationship entered a new equilibrium in that all investigated variables changed synchronously in terms of direction and magnitude. The results from this study reveal the mechanisms underlying the alternated inundation regime in Dongting Lake. The identified change points, some of which have not been previously reported, will allow a reappraisal of the current dam and reservoir operation strategies not only for flood/drought risk management but also for the maintenance and restoration of the regional ecological integrity.

AB Isotopic and chemical data on the mineral water, mud volcanoes fluid and associated gases from the biggest Russian island Sakhalin, together with previous stable isotope data (d(18)O, dD, C-13), allow elucidation of their origin and general evolution. The water fluid circulation is mainly related to marine environment inducing three distinct types: Na-HCO3-Cl alkali carbonate groundwaters, Na-Cl-HCO3 highly evolved saline and Na-Cl mature groundwaters, indicating different evolution. Chemical evolution of groundwater on Sakhalin Island demonstrated cation exchange and salinization as dominant evolutionary pathways. Isotopic composition of groundwaters varies from meteoric to metamorphic waters. These metamorphic waters consist of water hydration from the clay and seawater are traced in fluids of Yuzhno-Sakhalin mud volcano despite modification by mixing with meteoric waters and water-rock interaction processes. Fault systems that define the areas of highly mineralized water circulation appear to play a major role in the CO2 migration to the surface and CH4 generation. The delta C-13(CO2) values have pointed that gas phase in high-pCO(2) waters mostly consists of mantle-derived CO2. The carbon isotope signature of methane delta C-13(CH4) and delta D(CH4) indicates its distinct origin which is specified by tectonics. Methane manifestation in the south of the Sakhalin Island is mainly related to thermogenic reservoirs as they are more often dislocate by tectonics, and crossed by active and permeable faults. The sources of biogenous methane in the north of Sakhalin Island is related to younger and shallower reservoirs, and less affected by tectonic processes. The determinations of Rn-222 have allowed observing that maximal radon flux is associated with high pCO(2) waters. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well established that seismic waves traveling through porous media stimulate fluid flow and accelerate particle transport. However, the mechanism remains poorly understood. To quantify the coupling effect of hydrodynamic force, transportation distance, and ultrasonic stimulation on particle transport and fate in porous media, laboratory experiments were conducted using custom-built ultrasonic controlled soil column equipment. Three column lengths (23 cm, 33 cm, and 43 cm) were selected to examine the influence of transportation distance. Transport experiments were performed with 0 W, 600 W, 1000 W, 1400 W, and 1800 W of applied ultrasound, and flow rates of 0.065 cm/s, 0.130 cm/s, and 0.195 cm/s, to establish the roles of ultrasonic stimulation and hydrodynamic force. The laboratory results suggest that whilst ultrasonic stimulation does inhibit suspended-particle deposition and accelerate deposited-particle release, both hydrodynamic force and transportation distance are the principal controlling factors. The median particle diameter for the peak concentration was approximately 50% of that retained in the soil column. Simulated particle-breakthrough curves using extended traditional filtration theory effectively described the experimental curves, particularly the curves that exhibited a higher tailing concentration.

AB Due to increasing population worldwide, there is an urgent need to manage these important but diminishing groundwater resources efficiently to ensure their continued availability. The major innovative design of this study is to provide a practical assessment process for groundwater discharge under a regional demand by characterizing the nature of leaky confined aquifers overlain on a Mesozoic granitic gneiss basement which involves the important groundwater system in the Kinmen region (Taiwan, ROC) and the assessment of adoptable groundwater discharge in aquifer is needed. The storage coefficient presents an order of one in a thousand and hydraulic conductivity is approximately at the order of 1-8 m/d and 0.4-0.9 m/d for aquifer and aquitard respectively. Groundwater discharge and admissible number of pumping well is suggested considering scheduled maximum groundwater volume and head decline change for eastern and western studied area respectively. The safety subjected to the conservative issue is then addressed by the use of scheduled maximum groundwater volume. It reveals that the safety can be ensured using the indicator as scheduled maximum groundwater volume with predefined scenarios. The result can be utilized practically for developing management strategy of groundwater resources due to the applicability and novel of method. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TESTS; AQUIFER
AB Pump storage hydroelectricity is an efficient way to temporarily store energy. This technique requires to store temporarily a large volume of water in an upper reservoir, and to release it through turbines to the lower reservoir, to produce electricity. Recently, the idea of using old flooded quarries as a lower reservoir has been evoked. However, these flooded quarries are generally connected to unconfined aquifers. Consequently, pumping or injecting large volumes of water, within short time intervals, will have an impact on the adjacent aquifers. Conversely, water exchanges between the quarry and the aquifer may also influence the water level fluctuations in the lower reservoir. Using numerical modelling, this study investigates the interactions between generic flooded open pit quarries and adjacent unconfined aquifers, during various pump-storage cyclic stresses. The propagation of sinusoidal stresses in the adjacent porous media and the amplitude of water level fluctuations in the quarry are studied. Homogeneous rock media and the presence of fractures in the vicinity of the quarry are considered. Results show that hydrological quarry - rock interactions must be considered with caution, when implementing pump - storage systems. For rock media characterized by high hydraulic conductivity and porosity values, water volumes exchanges during cycles may affect significantly the amplitude of the water level fluctuations in the quarry, and as a consequence, the instantaneous electricity production. Regarding the impact of the pump - storage cyclic stresses on the surrounding environment, the distance of influence is potentially high under specific conditions, and is enhanced with the occurrence of rock heterogeneities, such as fractures. The impact around the quarry used as a lower reservoir thus appears as an important constraining factor regarding the feasibility of pump - storage systems, to be assessed carefully if groundwater level fluctuations around the quarry are expected to bring up adverse effects. Results highlight opportunities and challenges to be faced, to implement pump - storage hydroelectricity systems in old flooded open pit quarries. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new methodology based on the computational intelligence (CI) system is proposed and tested for modeling the classic 1D dam-break flow problem. The reason to seek for a new solution lies in the shortcomings of the existing analytical and numerical models. This includes the difficulty of using the exact solutions and the unwanted fluctuations, which arise in the numerical results. In this research, the application of the radial-basis-function (RBF) and multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) systems is detailed for the solution of twenty-nine dam-break scenarios. The models are developed using seven variables, i.e. the length of the channel, the depths of the up-and downstream sections, time, and distance as the inputs. Moreover, the depths and velocities of each computational node in the flow domain are considered as the model outputs. The models are validated against the analytical, and Lax-Wendroff and MacCormack FDM schemes. The findings indicate that the employed CI models are able to replicate the overall shape of the shock- and rarefaction-waves. Furthermore, the MLP system outperforms RBF and the tested numerical schemes. A new monolithic equation is proposed based on the best fitting model, which can be used as an efficient alternative to the existing piecewise analytic equations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB In a karstic field, the flow paths are very complex as they globally follow the conduit network. The responses generated from an investigation in this type of aquifer can be spatially highly variable. Therefore, the aim of the investigation in this case is to define a degree of connectivity between points of the field, in order to understand these flow paths. Harmonic pumping tests represent a possible investigation method for characterizing the subsurface flow of groundwater. They have several advantages compared to a constant-rate pumping (more signal possibilities, ease of extracting the signal in the responses and possibility of closed loop investigation). We show in this work that interpreting the responses from a harmonic pumping test is very useful for delineating a degree of connectivity between measurement points. We have firstly studied the amplitude and phase offset of responses from a harmonic pumping test in a theoretical synthetic modeling case in order to define a qualitative interpretation method in the time and frequency domains. Three different type of responses have been separated: a conduit connectivity response, a matrix connectivity, and a dual connectivity (response of a point in the matrix, but close to a conduit). We have then applied this method to measured responses at a field research site. Our interpretation method permits a quick and easy reconstruction of the main flow paths, and the whole set of field responses appear to give a similar range of responses to those seen in the theoretical synthetic case.

AB In the hydrological cycle, the infiltration process is a critical component in the distribution of water into the soil and in the groundwater system. The nonlinear dynamics of the soil infiltration process yield preferential flow which affects the water distribution in soil. Preferential flow is influenced by the interactions between water, soil, plants, and microorganisms. Although the relationship among the plant roots, their rhizodeposits and water transport in soil has been the subject of extensive study, the effect of microbial exudates has been studied in only a few cases. Here the authors investigated the influence of two artificial microbial exudates-catechol and riboflavin-on the infiltration process, particularly unstable fingered flow, one form of preferential flow. Flow experiments investigating the effects of types and concentrations of microbial exudates on unstable fingered flow were conducted in a two-dimensional tank that was filled with ASTM C778 graded silica sand. The light transmission method (LTM) which is based on capturing the light intensity transmitted through a sand-water system and then converting it into degree of water saturation was used to visualize and characterize the flow of water in porous media as well as to image and measure the spatial and temporal distribution of water in porous media. Flow patterns, vertical and horizontal profiles of the degree of water saturation of the fingers, as well as measurements of the fingers dimension (width), number, and velocity were determined using the light transmission method. Interfacial experiments exploring the influence of microbial exudates on the wettability behavior of water were performed by measuring the contact angle and the interfacial tension of the (solid)-gas-microbial exudate solution systems. Unstable wetting front generating fingered flow was observed in all infiltration experiments. The experimental results showed that the microbial exudate addition affected the infiltration process, as the measurements of the degree of saturation profiles and widths of the fingers differed from those of the control NaCl solution. These differences may be due to an improved water holding capacity in the presence of the microbial exudates. The lowest catechol solution concentration (10 mu M) produced the largest finger width (9.69 cm) among the tested catechol solution concentrations and all the other solutions including the control solution (7.24 cm). Moreover, the wettability of the medium for the catechol solution increased with an increase in concentration. The highest riboflavin solution concentration (1000 mu M) generated the highest finger width (7.75 cm) among the tested riboflavin solution concentrations. However, the wettability of the medium for the riboflavin solution decreased with an increase in concentration. Our study demonstrated that the microbial exudates which are biochemical compounds produced and released by microbes in the environment are capable of influencing the soil infiltration process. The results of this study also demonstrated that the influence of the contact angle expressed as (cos theta)(1/2) should be integrated in the scaling of the finger dimension, i.e., finger width, when the Miller and Miller (1956) scaling theory is applied for the hydrodynamic scaling in porous media.

AB The effects of vegetation cover on overland flow and erosion processes on hillslopes vary with vegetation type and spatial distribution and the different vegetation components, including the above- and below-ground biomass. However, few attempts have been made to quantify how these factors affect erosion processes. Field experimental plots (5 m x 2 m) with a slope of approximately 25 degrees were constructed and simulated rainfall (60 mm hr(-1)) (Rainfall) and simulated rainfall combined with upslope overland flow (20 L min(-1)) (Rainfall + Flow) were applied. Three grass species were planted, specifically Astragalus adsurgens (A. adsurgens), Medicago sativa (M. sativa) and Cosmos bipinnatus (C. bipinnatus). To isolate and quantify the relative contributions of the above-ground grass parts (stems, litter cover and leaves) and the roots to reducing surface runoff and erosion, each of the three grass species was subjected to three treatments: intact grass control (IG), no litter or leaves (only the grass stems and roots were reserved) (NLL), and only roots remaining (OR). The results showed that planting grass significantly reduced overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield, and the mean reductions were 21.8%, 29.1% and 67.1%, respectively. M. sativa performed the best in controlling water and soil losses due to its thick canopy and dense, fine roots. Grasses reduced soil erosion mainly during the early stage of overland flow generation. The above-ground grass parts primarily contributed to reducing overland flow rate and velocity, with mean relative contributions of 64% and 86%, respectively. The roots played a predominant role in reducing soil erosion, with mean contribution of 84%. Due to the impact of upslope inflow, overland flow rate and velocity and sediment yield increased under the Rainfall + Flow conditions. The results suggest that grass species on downslope parts of semi-arid hillslopes performed better in reducing water and soil losses. This study is beneficial for forage selection, allocation and management practices, such as forage harvesting, when implementing restoration strategies to control soil and water losses.

AB Spatial distribution of groundwater recharge/discharge fluxes has an important impact on mass and energy exchanges in shallow streambeds. During the last two decades, extensive studies have been devoted to the quantification of one-dimensional (1-D) vertical exchange fluxes. Nevertheless, few studies were conducted to characterize two-dimensional (2-D) heterogeneous flux fields that commonly exist in real-world cases. In this study, we used an iterative ensemble smoother (IES) to quantify the spatial distribution of 2-D exchange fluxes by assimilating hydraulic head and temperature measurements. Four assimilation scenarios corresponding to different potential field applications were tested. In the first three scenarios, the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity fields were first inferred from hydraulic head and/or temperature measurements, and then the flux fields were derived through Darcy's law using the estimated conductivity fields. In the fourth scenario, the flux fields were estimated directly from the temperature measurements, which is more efficient and especially suitable for the situation that a complete knowledge of flow boundary conditions is unavailable. We concluded that, the best estimation could be achieved through jointly assimilating hydraulic head and temperature measurements, and temperature data were superior to the head data when they were used independently. Overall, the IES method provided more robust and accurate vertical flux estimations than those given by the widely used analytical solution-based methods. Furthermore, IES gave reasonable uncertainty estimations, which were unavailable in traditional methods. Since temperature can be accurately monitored with high spatial and temporal resolutions, the coupling of heat tracing techniques and IES provides promising potential in quantifying complex exchange fluxes under field conditions.

AB Snowmelt-runoff processes on frozen ground are poorly understood at the hillslope scale. This is especially true for hillslopes on the northern Great Plains of North America where long periods of snow-covered frozen ground with very shallow slopes mask any spatial patterns and process controls on connectivity and hillslope runoff generation. This study examines a 4.66 ha (46,600 m(2)) hillslope on the northern Great Plains during the 2014 spring snowmelt season to explore hillslope runoff processes. Specifically, we explore the spatial patterns of runoff production source areas and examine how surface topography and patterns of snow cover, snow water equivalent, soil water content, and thawed layer depth - which we measured on a 10 m grid across our 46,600 m(2) hillslope - affect melt water partitioning and runoff connectivity. A key question was whether or not the controls on connectivity are consistent with the fill and spill mechanism found in rain-dominated and unfrozen soil domains. The contrast between the slow infiltration rates into frozen soil and the relatively fast rates of snowmelt delivery to the soil surface resulted in water accumulation in small depressions under the snowpack. Consequently, infiltration was minimal over the 12 day melt period. Instead, nested filling of micro and meso-depressions was followed by macro-scale, whole-slope spilling. This spilling occurred when large patches of ponded water exceeded the storage capacity behind downslope micro barriers in the surface topography, and flows from them coalesced to drive a rapid increase in runoff at the hillslope outlet. These observations of ponded water and flowpaths followed mapable fill and spill locations based on 2 m resolution digital topographic analysis. Interestingly, while surface topography is relatively unimportant under unfrozen conditions at our site because of low relief and high infiltrability, surface topography shows episodically critical importance for connectivity and runoff generation when the ground is frozen.

AB GIS-based multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is increasingly used to support flood risk assessment. However, conventional GIS-MCDA methods fail to adequately represent spatial variability and are accompanied with considerable uncertainty. It is, thus, important to incorporate spatial variability and uncertainty into GIS-based decision analysis procedures. This research develops a spatially explicit, probabilistic GIS-MCDA approach for the delineation of potentially flood susceptible areas. The approach integrates the probabilistic and the local ordered weighted averaging (OWA) methods via Monte Carlo simulation, to take into account the uncertainty related to criteria weights, spatial heterogeneity of preferences and the risk attitude of the analyst. The approach is applied to a pilot study for the Gucheng County central China, heavily affected by the hazardous 2012 flood. A GIS database of six geomorphological and hydrometeorological factors for the evaluation of susceptibility was created. Moreover, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis were performed to investigate the robustness of the model. The results indicate that the ensemble method improves the robustness of the model outcomes with respect to variation in criteria weights and identifies which criteria weights are most responsible for the variability of model outcomes. Therefore, the proposed. approach is an improvement over the conventional deterministic method and can provides a more rational, objective and unbiased tool for flood susceptibility evaluation.

AB This study discusses the development and performance of a rapid prediction system capable of representing the joint rainfall-runoff and storm surge flood response of tropical cyclones (TCs) for probabilistic risk analysis. Due to the computational demand required for accurately representing storm surge with the high-fidelity ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic model and its coupling with additional numerical models to represent rainfall-runoff, a surrogate or statistical model was trained to represent the relationship between hurricane wind- and pressure-field characteristics and their peak joint flood response typically determined from physics based numerical models. This builds upon past studies that have only evaluated surrogate models for predicting peak surge, and provides the first system capable of probabilistically representing joint flood levels from TCs. The utility of this joint flood prediction system is then demonstrated by improving upon probabilistic TC flood risk products, which currently account for storm surge but do not take into account TC associated rainfall-runoff. Results demonstrate the source apportionment of rainfall-runoff versus storm surge and highlight that slight increases in flood risk levels may occur due to the interaction between rainfall-runoff and storm surge as compared to the Federal Emergency Management Association's (FEMAs) current practices.

AB Quantifying rainfall-derived inflow and infiltration (RDII) in a sanitary sewer is difficult when RDII and overflow occur simultaneously. This study proposes a novel conductivity-based method for estimating RDII. The method separately decomposes rainfall-derived inflow (RDI) and rainfall-induced infiltration (RII) on the basis of conductivity data. Fast Fourier transform was adopted to analyze variations in the flow and water quality during dry weather. Nonlinear curve fitting based on the least squares algorithm was used to optimize parameters in the proposed RDII model. The method was successfully applied to real-life case studies, in which inflow and infiltration were successfully estimated for three typical rainfall events with total rainfall volumes of 6.25 mm (light), 28.15 mm (medium), and 178 mm (heavy). Uncertainties of model parameters were estimated using the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) method and were found to be acceptable. Compared with traditional flow-based methods, the proposed approach exhibits distinct advantages in estimating RDII and overflow, particularly when the two processes happen simultaneously.

AB The concurrence of flash floods and debris flows is of particular concern, because it may amplify the hazard corresponding to the individual generative processes. This paper presents a coupled modelling framework for the predictions of flash flood response and of the occurrence of debris flows initiated by channel bed mobilization. The framework combines a spatially distributed flash flood response model and a debris flow initiation model to define a threshold value for the peak flow which permits identification of channelized debris flow initiation. The threshold is defined over the channel network as a function of the upslope area and of the local channel bed slope, and it is based on assumptions concerning the properties of the channel bed material and of the morphology of the channel network. The model is validated using data from an extreme rainstorm that impacted the 140 km(2) Vizze basin in the Eastern Italian Alps on August 4-5, 2012. The results show that the proposed methodology has improved skill in identifying the catchments where debris-flows are triggered, compared to the use of simpler thresholds based on rainfall properties.

AB Accurate daily river flow forecast is essential in many applications of water resources such as hydropower operation, agricultural planning and flood control. This paper presents a forecasting approach to deal with a newly addressed situation where hydrological data exist for a period longer than that of meteorological data (measurements asymmetry). In fact, one of the potential solutions to resolve measurements asymmetry issue is data re-sampling. It is a matter of either considering only the hydrological data or the balanced part of the hydro-meteorological data set during the forecasting process. However, the main disadvantage is that we may lose potentially relevant information from the left-out data. In this research, the key output is a Two-Phase Constructive Fuzzy inference hybrid model that is implemented over the non re-sampled data. The introduced modeling approach must be capable of exploiting the available data efficiently with higher prediction efficiency relative to Constructive Fuzzy Model trained over re-sampled' data set. The study was applied to Litani River in the Bekaa Valley Lebanon by using 4 years of rainfall and 24 years of river flow daily measurements. A Constructive Fuzzy System Model (C-FSM) and a Two-Phase Constructive Fuzzy System Model (TPC-FSM) are trained. Upon validating, the second model has shown a primarily competitive performance and accuracy with the ability to preserve a higher day-to-day variability for 1, 3 and 6 days ahead. In fact, for the longest lead period, the C-FSM and TPC-FSM were able of explaining respectively 84.6% and 86.5% of the actual river flow variation. Overall, the results indicate that TPC-FSM model has provided a better tool to capture extreme flows in the process of streamflow prediction. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines the hydrological impact of the seasonality of precipitation and maximum evaporation: seasonality is, after aridity, a second-order determinant of catchment water yield. Based on a data set of 171 French catchments (where aridity ranged between 0.2 and 1.2), we present a parameterization of three commonly-used water balance formulas (namely, Turc-Mezentsev, Tixeront-Fu and Oldekop formulas) to account for seasonality effects. We quantify the improvement of seasonality-based parameterization in terms of the reconstitution of both catchment streamflow and water yield. The significant improvement obtained (reduction of RMSE between 9 and 14% depending on the formula) demonstrates the importance of climate seasonality in the determination of long-term catchment water balance.

AB Real-time precipitation data with high spatiotemporal resolutions are crucial for accurate hydrological forecasting. To improve the spatial resolution and quality of satellite precipitation, a three-step satellite and gauge precipitation merging method was formulated in this study: (1) bilinear interpolation is first applied to downscale coarser satellite precipitation to a finer resolution (P-s); (2) the (mixed) geographically weighted regression methods coupled with a weighting function are then used to estimate biases of Ps as functions of gauge observations (P-o) and P-s; and (3) biases of P-s are finally corrected to produce a merged precipitation product. Based on the above framework, eight algorithms, a combination of two geographically weighted regression methods and four weighting functions, are developed to merge CMORPH (CPC MORPHing technique) precipitation with station observations on a daily scale in the Ziwuhe Basin of China. The geographical variables (elevation, slope, aspect, surface roughness, and distance to the coastline) and a meteorological variable (wind speed) were used for merging precipitation to avoid the artificial spatial autocorrelation resulting from traditional interpolation methods. The results show that the combination of the MGWR and BI-square function (MGWR-BI) has the best performance (R = 0.863 and RMSE = 7.273 mm/day) among the eight algorithms. The MGWR-BI algorithm was then applied to produce hourly merged precipitation product. Compared to the original CMORPH product (R = 0.208 and RMSE = 1.208 mm/hr), the quality of the merged data is significantly higher (R = 0.724 and RMSE = 0.706 mmihr). The developed merging method not only improves the spatial resolution and quality of the satellite product but also is easy to implement, which is valuable for hydrological modeling and other applications.

AB The temporal variation of model parameters is affected by the catchment conditions and has a significant impact on hydrological simulation. This study aims to evaluate the seasonality and downscaling of model parameter across time scales based on monthly and mean annual water balance models with a common model framework. Two parameters of the monthly model, i.e., k and m, are assumed to be time-variant at different months. Based on the hydrological data set from 121 MOPEX catchments in the United States, we firstly analyzed the correlation between parameters (k and m) and catchment properties (NDVI and frequency of rainfall events, alpha). The results show that parameter k is positively correlated with NDVI or alpha, while the correlation is opposite for parameter m, indicating that precipitation and vegetation affect monthly water balance by controlling temporal variation of parameters k and m. The multiple linear regression is then used to fit the relationship between 8 and the means and coefficient of variations of parameters k and m. Based on the empirical equation and the correlations between the time-variant parameters and NDVI, the mean annual parameter s is downscaled to monthly k and m. The results show that it has lower NSEs than these from model with time-variant k and m being calibrated through SCE-UA, while for several study catchments, it has higher NSEs than that of the model with constant parameters. The proposed method is feasible and provides a useful tool for temporal scaling of model parameter. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) is greatly important for water resources throughout the entire Yellow River Basin. Streamfiow in the SRYR has experienced great changes over the past few decades, which is closely related to the frozen ground degradation; however, the extent of this influence is, still unclear. In this study, the air freezing index (DDFa) is selected as an indicator for the degree of frozen ground degradation. A water-energy balance equation within the Budyko framework is employed to quantify the streamflow response to the direct impact of climate change, which manifests as changes in the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration, as well as the impact of frozen ground degradation, which can be regarded as part of the indirect impact of climate change. The results show that the direct impact of climate change and the impact of frozen ground degradation can explain 55% and 33%, respectively, of the streamflow decrease for the entire SRYR from Period 1 (1965-1989) to Period 2 (1990-2003). In the permafrost-dominated region upstream of the Jimai hydrological station, the impact of frozen ground degradation can explain 71% of the streamflow decrease. From Period 2 (1990-2003) to Period 3 (2004-2015), the observed streamflow did not increase as much as the precipitation; this could be attributed to the combined effects of increasing potential evapotranspiration and more importantly, frozen ground degradation. Frozen ground degradation could influence streamflow by increasing the groundwater storage when the active layer thickness increases in permafrost-dominated regions. These findings will help develop a better understanding of the impact of frozen ground degradation on water resources in the Tibetan Plateau. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Soil and water loss from farmland causes land degradation and water pollution, thus continued efforts are needed to establish mathematical model for quantitative analysis of relevant processes and mechanisms. In this study, an approximate analytical solution has been developed for overland flow model and sediment transport model, offering a simple and effective means to predict overland flow and erosion under natural rainfall conditions. In the overland flow model, the flow regime was considered to be transitional with the value of parameter beta (in the kinematic wave model) approximately two. The change rate of unit discharge with distance was assumed to be constant and equal to the runoff rate at the outlet of the plane. The excess rainfall was considered to be constant under uniform rainfall conditions. The overland flow model developed can be further applied to natural rainfall conditions by treating excess rainfall intensity as constant over a small time interval. For the sediment model, the recommended values of the runoff erosion calibration constant (c(r)) and the splash erosion calibration constant (c(f)) have been given in this study so that it is easier to use the model. These recommended values are 0.15 and 0.12, respectively. Comparisons with observed results were carried out to validate the proposed analytical solution. The results showed that the approximate analytical solution developed in this paper closely matches the observed data, thus providing an alternative method of predicting runoff generation and sediment yield, and offering a more convenient method of analyzing the quantitative relationships between variables. Furthermore, the model developed in this study can be used as a theoretical basis for developing runoff and erosion control methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate and land cover are two major factors affecting the water fluxes and balance across spatiotemporal scales. These two factors and their impacts on hydrology are often interlinked. The quantification and differentiation of such impacts is important for developing sustainable land and water management strategies. Here, we calibrated the well-known Hydrus-1D model in a data-rich boreal headwater catchment in Scotland to assess the role of two dominant vegetation types (shrubs vs. trees) in regulating the soil water partitioning and balance. We also applied previously established climate projections for the area and replaced shrubs with trees to imitate current land use change proposals in the region, so as to quantify the potential impacts of climate and land cover changes on soil hydrology. Under tree cover, evapotranspiration and deep percolation to recharge groundwater was about 44% and 57% of annual precipitation, whilst they were about 10% lower and 9% higher respectively under shrub cover in this humid, low energy environment. Meanwhile, tree canopies intercepted 39% of annual precipitation in comparison to 23% by shrubs. Soils with shrub cover stored more water than tree cover. Land cover change was shown to have stronger impacts than projected climate change. With a complete replacement of shrubs with trees under future climate projections at this site, evapotranspiration is expected to increase by similar to 39% while percolation to decrease by 21% relative to the current level, more pronounced than the modest changes in the two components (<8%) with climate change only. The impacts would be particularly marked in warm seasons, which may result in water stress experienced by the vegetation. The findings provide an important evidence base for adaptive management strategies of future changes in low-energy humid environments, where vegetation growth is usually restricted by radiative energy and not water availability while few studies that quantify soil water partitioning exist.

AB To address certain limitations with their current operational model, Environment and Climate Change Canada recently developed the Soil, Vegetation, and Snow (SVS) land surface model and the representation of subsurface hydrological processes was targeted as an area for improvement. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of HydroSVS, the component of SVS responsible for the vertical redistribution of water, to simulate soil moisture under snow-free conditions when using flux-tower observations of evapotranspiration as forcing data. We assessed (1) model fidelity by comparing soil moisture modelled with HydroSVS to point-scale measurements of volumetric soil water content and (2) model complexity by comparing the performance of HydroSVS to that of HydroGeoSphere, a state-of-the-art integrated surface and subsurface hydrologic model. To do this, we performed one-dimensional soil column simulations at four sites of the AmeriFlux network. Results indicate that under Mediterranean and temperate climates, HydroSVS satisfactorily simulated soil moisture (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency between 0.26 and 0.70; R-2 >= 0.80), with a performance comparable to HydroGeoSphere (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency >= 0.60; R-2 >= 0.80). However, HydroSVS performed weakly under a semiarid climate while HydroGeoSphere performed relatively well. By decoupling the magnitude and sourcing of evapotranspiration, this study proposes a powerful diagnostic tool to evaluate the representation of subsurface hydrological processes in land surface models. Overall, this study highlights the potential of SVS for hydrological applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Existing literature provides contradictory information about variation in potential green roof hydrological performance over time. This study has evaluated a long-term hydrological monitoring record from a series of extensive green roof test beds to identify long-term evolutions and sub-annual (seasonal) variations in potential hydrological performance. Monitoring of nine differently-configured extensive green roof test beds took place over a period of 6 years in Sheffield, UK.
   Long-term evolutions and sub-annual trends in maximum potential retention performance were identified through physical monitoring of substrate field capacity over time. An independent evaluation of temporal variations in detention performance was undertaken through the fitting of reservoir-routing model parameters. Aggregation of the resulting retention and detention variations permitted the prediction of extensive green roof hydrological performance in response to a 1-in-30-year 1-h summer design storm for Sheffield, UK, which facilitated the comparison of multi and sub-annual hydrological performance variations.
   Sub-annual (seasonal) variation was found to be significantly greater than long-term evolution. Potential retention performance increased by up to 12% after 5-years, whilst the maximum sub-annual variation in potential retention was 27%. For vegetated roof configurations, a 4% long-term improvement was observed for detention performance, compared to a maximum 63% sub-annual variation. Consistent long-term reductions in detention performance were observed in unvegetated roof configurations, with a non-standard expanded-clay substrate experiencing a 45% reduction in peak attenuation over 5-years. Conventional roof configurations exhibit stable long-term hydrological performance, but are nonetheless subject to sub-annual variation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The transport of water and vapour in the desert vadose zone plays a critical role in the overall water and energy balances of near-surface environments in arid regions. However, field measurements in extremely dry environments face many difficulties and challenges, so few studies have examined water and vapour transport processes in the desert vadose zone. The main objective of this study is to analyse the mechanisms of soil water and vapour transport in the desert vadose zone (depth of similar to 350 cm) by using measured and modelled data in an extremely arid environment. The field experiments are implemented in an area of the Gobi desert in northwestern China to measure the soil properties, daily soil moisture and temperature, daily water-table depth and temperature, and daily meteorological records from DOYs (Days of Year) 114-212 in 2014 (growing season). The Hydrus-1D model, which simulates the coupled transport of water, vapour and heat in the vadose zone, is employed to simulate the layered soil moisture and temperature regimes and analyse the transport processes of soil water and vapour. The measured results show that the soil water and temperatures near the land surface have visible daily fluctuations across the entire soil profile. Thermal vapour movement is the most important component of the total water flux and the soil temperature gradient is the major driving factor that affects vapour transport in the desert vadose zone. The most active water and heat exchange occurs in the upper soil layer (depths of 0-25 cm). The matric potential change from the precipitation mainly re-draws the spatio-temporal distribution of the isothermal liquid water in the soil near the land surface. The matric potential has little effect on the isothermal vapour and thermal liquid water flux. These findings offer new insights into the liquid water and vapour movement processes in the extremely arid environment. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB There is a need to model and predict the transfer of phosphorus (P) from land to water, but this is challenging because of the large number of complex physical and biogeochemical processes involved. This study presents, for the first time, a 'limits of acceptability' approach of the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) framework to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), in an application to a water quality problem in the Newby Beck catchment (12.5 km(2)), Cumbria, United Kingdom (UK). Using high frequency outlet data (discharge and P), individual evaluation criteria (limits of acceptability) were assigned to observed discharge and P loads for all evaluation time steps, identifying where the model was performing well/poorly and to infer which processes required improvement in the model structure. Initial limits of acceptability were required to be relaxed by a substantial amount (by factors of between 5.3 and 6.7 on a normalized scale depending on the evaluation criteria used) in order to gain a set of behavioral simulations (1001 and 1016, respectively out of 5,000,000). Of the 39 model parameters tested, the representation of subsurface processes and associated parameters, were consistently shown as critical to the model not meeting the evaluation criteria, irrespective of the chosen evaluation metric. It is therefore concluded that SWAT is not an appropriate model to guide P management in this catchment. This approach highlights the importance of high frequency monitoring data for setting robust model evaluation criteria. It also raises the question as to whether it is possible to have sufficient input data available to drive such models so that we can have confidence in their predictions and their ability to inform catchment management strategies to tackle the problem of diffuse pollution from agriculture.
