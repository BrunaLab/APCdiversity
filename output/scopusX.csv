VACCINATION IN PREGNANT ANIMALS WITH THE VACCINE CANDIDATES DID NOT INDUCE ABORTION, STILLBIRTHS OR A REDUCTION IN LITTER SIZE. MULTIPLE TISSUES IN THE GILTS AND PIGLETS WERE EXAMINED AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY TO ASSESS BACTERIAL COLONIZATION AND HISTOPATHOLOGICAL CHANGES. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF VACCINE PERSISTENCE IN THE GILTS OR BACTERIAL COLONIZATION IN THE FETUSES. ALTOGETHER, THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT BOTH VACCINE CANDIDATES ARE SAFE FOR USE IN PREGNANT SWINE. ANALYSIS OF THE HUMORAL RESPONSES, SPECIFICALLY ANTI-BRUCELLA IGG LEVELS MEASURED IN SERUM, DEMONSTRATED A ROBUST RESPONSE INDUCED BY EITHER VACCINE, BUT OF SHORTER DURATION (46 WEEKS POST-INOCULATION) COMPARED TO THAT OBSERVED IN CATTLE OR EXPERIMENTALLY INFECTED MICE. SUCH A TRANSIENT HUMORAL RESPONSE MAY PROVE TO BE BENEFICIAL IN CASES WHERE THE VACCINE IS USED IN ERADICATION CAMPAIGNS AND IN THE DIFFERENTIATION OF VACCINATED FROM INFECTED ANIMALS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT FUTURE EFFICACY STUDIES OF BOTH VACCINE CANDIDATES IN SWINE. 2019","B. ABORTUS S19; B.

IN 201718 A(H3N2) AND A(H1N1)PDM09 VIRUSES CO-CIRCULATED. THE A(H3N2) VACCINE COMPONENT WAS THE SAME IN BOTH SEASONS, WHILE THE A(H1N1)PDM09 COMPONENT CHANGED IN 201718. IN BOTH SEASONS, VACCINE SEED A(H3N2) VIRUSES DEVELOPED ADAPTATIONS/ALTERATIONS DURING PROPAGATION IN EGGS, IMPACTING ANTIGENICITY. METHODS: WE USED THE TEST-NEGATIVE DESIGN IN A MULTICENTRE PRIMARY CARE CASE-CONTROL STUDY IN 12 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO MEASURE 201617 AND 201718 INFLUENZA VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS (VE) AGAINST LABORATORY-CONFIRMED INFLUENZA A(H1N1)PDM09 AND A(H3N2) OVERALL AND BY AGE GROUP. RESULTS: DURING THE 201718 SEASON, THE OVERALL VE AGAINST INFLUENZA A(H1N1)PDM09 WAS 59% (95% CI: 4769). AMONG THOSE AGED 014, 1564 AND 65 YEARS, VE AGAINST A(H1N1)PDM09 WAS 64% (95% CI: 3779), 50% (95% CI: 2866) AND 66% (95% CI: 4280), RESPECTIVELY.

EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS ARE PRIMARILY DIRECTED AT PATIENTS AND PARENTS RATHER THAN HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS (HCPS), DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT PROVIDER RECOMMENDATION IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF VACCINE UPTAKE. THE OBJECTIVES FOR THIS REVIEW ARE TO SYNTHESIZE THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE RELATED TO THE KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND BELIEFS OF HCPS SURROUNDING HPV VACCINATION, TO SUMMARIZE PROVIDER-SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN EVALUATED, AND TO REVIEW EXISTING PROVIDER-SPECIFIC EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FROM NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND WHETHER THEY ALIGN WITH THE GAPS IDENTIFIED. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH WAS PERFORMED USING PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE, CINAHL, AND ERIC WITH MESH TERMS HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS, VACCINE, EDUCATION, WORKSHOP, TRAINING, KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE, BELIEF, INTENTION, AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. FULL TEXT ARTICLES WERE OBTAINED FOR STUDIES THAT DESCRIBED THE KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES OF PROVIDERS AND/OR IMPACT OF EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS. DATA EXTRACTION WAS PERFORMED BY FOUR INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS. WEBSITES OF AMERICAN ORGANIZATIONS WITH AN INTEREST IN HPV VACCINATION WERE MANUALLY SEARCHED FOR PROVIDER RESOURCES. RESULTS: 1066 PUBLICATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED, AND 98 ARTICLES WERE FULLY REVIEWED WITH 40 ULTIMATELY INCLUDED. PROVIDERS KNOWLEDGE ON HPV WAS GENERALLY LOW WITH A CORRESPONDINGLY LOW VACCINE RECOMMENDATION RATE. PROVIDER-SPECIFIC EDUCATION (E.G., DIDACTIC SESSION AND COMMUNICATION TRAINING) WITH COMPLIMENTARY INTERVENTIONS DEMONSTRATED INCREASED KNOWLEDGE AND VACCINE SERIES INITIATION AND COMPLETION. THEMES IDENTIFIED IN DESCRIPTIVE STUDIES HIGHLIGHTED PROVIDERS LACK OF GENERAL HPV AND VACCINE KNOWLEDGE, LOW SELF-CONFIDENCE IN COUNSELLING AND ADDRESSING PARENTAL CONCERNS, AND DISCOMFORT IN DISCUSSING SEXUAL ISSUES RELATED TO VACCINATION.

THE STABILIZATION HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO BE DUE TO DIRECT ABSORPTION OF THE DRUG MOLECULES ONTO THE MS SURFACE, I.E. THE DRUG MONOLAYER. IN ADDITION, DRUG THAT IS NOT IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH MS SURFACE CAN FILL THE PORES UP TO ITS PORE FILLING CAPACITY (PFC) AND IS POTENTIALLY STABILIZED BY CONFINEMENT DUE TO THE PORE SIZE BEING SMALLER THAN A CRYSTAL NUCLEI. FOR DRUGS WITH HIGH RECRYSTALLIZATION TENDENCIES, ANY DRUG OUTSIDE THE PORES CRYSTALLIZES DUE TO ITS POOR PHYSICAL STABILITY. THE DRUG MONOLAYER DOES NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE GLASS TRANSITION TEMPERATURE (TG) IN THE DSC, HOWEVER, THE CONFINED AMORPHOUS DRUG ABOVE MLC HAS A TG AND THE HEAT CAPACITY (CP) OVER THE TG INCREASES WITH AN INCREASING FRACTION OF CONFINED AMORPHOUS DRUG. HENCE, SEVERAL DRUG LOADING VALUES ABOVE THE MLC WERE INVESTIGATED TOWARDS THE PRESENCE OF A TG AND CP USING DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY (DSC). A LINEAR CORRELATION BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF CONFINED AMORPHOUS DRUG AND ITS CP WAS IDENTIFIED FOR THE MIXTURES BETWEEN THE MLC AND PFC. BY SUBSEQUENT EXTRAPOLATION TO ZERO CP THE EXPERIMENTAL MLC COULD BE DETERMINED. USING THEORETICAL DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY (DFT) AND AB INITIO MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (AIMD), THE BINDING ENERGIES FOR THE MONOLAYER SUGGESTED THAT THE MONOLAYER IN FACT IS THERMODYNAMICALLY MORE FAVORABLE THAN THE CRYSTALLINE FORM, WHEREAS THE CONFINED AMORPHOUS FORM IS THERMODYNAMICALLY LESS FAVORABLE. CONSEQUENTLY, A PHYSICAL STABILITY STUDY SHOWED THAT THE CONFINED AMORPHOUS DRUGS ABOVE THE MLC WERE THERMODYNAMICALLY UNSTABLE AND CONSEQUENTLY FLOWING OUT OF THE PORES IN ORDER TO CRYSTALLIZE, WHEREAS THE MONOLAYER REMAINED PHYSICALLY STABLE. 2019","AMORPHOUS; DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY (DSC); LOADING CAPACITY; MESOPOROUS SILICA",NA,"ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY, UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK; LABORATRIO DE NANOTECNOLOGIA FARMACUTICA E SISTEMAS DE LIBERAO DE FRMACOS, FACULDADE DE FARMCIA, UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE GOIS UFG, GOINIA, GOIS, BRAZIL; DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY, UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT, BURLINGTON, VT, UNITED STATES; BIONEER:FARMA, DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY, UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN, COPENHAGEN, DENMARK","10.1016/J.IJPX.2019.100026","100026","LBMANN, K., DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACY, UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGENDENMARK, EMAIL: KORBINIAN.LOBMANNSUND.KU.DK",NA,NA,"25901567",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","1",2019,"none","UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN;UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE GOIS UFG;UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT;UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGEN","UNIVERSITY OF COPENHAGENDENMARK",NA,"ANTONINO RSCMQ, 2019, INT J PHARM X","ANTONINO RSCMQ, 2019, INT J PHARM X"

HERE, WE DEVELOPED AND CHARACTERIZED LIPOSOMAL BORTEZOMIB FORMULATIONS IN ORDER TO FIND THE MOST OPTIMAL LOADING CONDITIONS. POLYOLS WERE USED TO ENTRAP BORTEZOMIB INSIDE THE LIPOSOMES AS BORONATE ESTER VIA A REMOTE LOADING STRATEGY. EFFECT OF VARIOUS POLYOLS, INCUBATION DURATION, TEMPERATURE, AND TOTAL LIPID CONCENTRATION ON LOADING EFFICIENCY WAS EXAMINED. MOREOVER, THE EFFECT OF DRUG/LIPID RATIO ON THE RELEASE KINETICS WAS STUDIED. LOADING EFFICIENCY WAS MAXIMAL WHEN USING MEGLUMINE PLUS MANNITOL AS ENTRAPPING AGENTS. LOADING AT ROOM TEMPERATURE WAS BETTER THAN AT 60 C AND LOADING EFFICIENCY WAS INCREASED WITH INCREASING TOTAL LIPID CONCENTRATIONS. THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN DRUG/LIPID RATIO AND RELEASED AMOUNT OF BORTEZOMIB. IN VITRO RELEASE KINETICS IN HBS AND HUMAN PLASMA SHOWED TIME DEPENDENT RELEASE.

THE LOADING CAPACITIES OF THREE MODEL DRUGS (CELECOXIB, CINNARIZINE, AND PARACETAMOL) WERE DETERMINED IN FIVE DIFFERENT MS GRADES OF SYLYSIA WITH IDENTICAL CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, BUT VARYING SURFACE AREA, PORE DIAMETER AND PORE VOLUME. THE EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED LOADING CAPACITIES WERE COMPARED TO THEORETICAL LOADING CAPACITIES, CALCULATED BASED ON THE SURFACE AREA AND AMORPHOUS DENSITY OF THE DRUGS, AND THE SURFACE AREA AND PORE VOLUME OF THE MS. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THE MONOMOLECULAR LOADING CAPACITY GENERALLY INCREASED WITH INCREASING SURFACE AREA AND DECREASING PORE VOLUME OF THE MS. HOWEVER, THE MS GRADE WITH THE HIGHEST SURFACE AREA DID NOT DISPLAY THE HIGHEST MONOMOLECULAR LOADING CAPACITY FOR ANY OF THE THREE DRUGS. THIS WAS PROBABLY A RESULT OF THE DECREASING PORE DIAMETER NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASING SURFACE AREA OF THE MS I.E., IF THE PORE IS SMALLER THAN THE DRUG MOLECULE, THE DRUG CANNOT ACCESS THE AVAILABLE SURFACE AREA. FOR THESE SYSTEMS, THE AMORPHOUS DENSITY OF THE DRUG AND THE PORE VOLUME OF THE MS WAS USED TO ESTIMATE THE THEORETICAL PORE FILLING CAPACITY, WHICH WAS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED LOADING CAPACITY.

WE PREPARED ORALLY DISINTEGRATING TEA TABLETS (ODTTS) CONTAINING A 1 W/W% MASS FRACTION OF ONE OF FIVE POLYSACCHARIDES (GUM ARABIC, CARRAGEENAN, GUAR GUM, TAMARIND GUM, OR PECTIN) AND EVALUATED THE SWELLING DEGREE, TABLET HARDNESS, FRIABILITY, DISINTEGRATION TIME, AND ADHESIVE PROPERTIES. ALL TABLETS HAD A SWELLING DEGREE OF ABOUT 1 MM, A HARDNESS OF OVER 13 N, AND A FRIABILITY DEGREE OF <1%. TABLETS CONTAINING GUM ARABIC AND TAMARIND GUM HAD DISINTEGRATION TIMES OF 30 S OR LESS AND SATISFIED REQUIREMENTS AS ORALLY DISINTEGRATING TABLETS. THIS COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THEIR HIGH VOID CONTENTS, WHICH ALLOWED FOR WATER PENETRATION. THE ADHESIVE PROPERTIES AND PARTICLE RETENTION RATIOS WERE HIGHEST IN ODTTS CONTAINING TAMARIND GUM, WHICH WAS THOUGHT TO BE CAUSED BY THE RAPID DISINTEGRATION AND HIGH VISCOSITY OF THE TAMARIND GUM ITSELF. WHEN WE INVESTIGATED CHANGING THE MASS FRACTION OF TAMARIND GUM, WE FOUND 1 W/W% WAS MOST SUITABLE FOR RAPID DISINTEGRATION AND HIGH ADHESIVENESS. THE ODTTS CONTAINING 1 W/W% TAMARIND GUM SHOWED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH INHIBITION TOWARDS STREPTOCOCCUS MUTANS.

HOWEVER, THE PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF AA ARE NOT OPTIMAL FOR SKIN UPTAKE AND THE MOLECULE IS ALSO UNSTABLE, READILY UNDERGOING OXIDATION ON EXPOSURE TO AIR. THE COMPOUND 3-O-ETHYL-L-ASCORBIC ACID (EA) HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AS A STABLE VITAMIN C DERIVATIVE AND HAS BEEN USED IN TOPICAL PRODUCTS. THE AIMS OF THIS WORK WERE TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE CHARACTERISATION OF PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF EA AS WELL AS TO INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS NEAT SOLVENTS ON EA SKIN DELIVERY. NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (NMR), MASS SPECTROSCOPY, DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY (DSC) AND THERMOGRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS (TGA) WERE USED TO CHARACTERISE THE MOLECULE. THE PKA OF THE COMPOUND AND THE PARTITION COEFFICIENT LOGP(O/W) WERE EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED. A NEW HPLC METHOD FOR ANALYSIS OF THE MOLECULE WAS ALSO DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED. A NUMBER OF SOLVENTS FOR TOPICAL PREPARATIONS WERE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR WIDE USE AS EXCIPIENTS IN TOPICAL FORMULATIONS, THEIR POTENTIAL TO ACT AS SKIN PENETRATION ENHANCERS AND THEIR FAVOURABLE SAFETY PROFILES. THE SOLUBILITY AND STABILITY OF EA WAS EXAMINED. SKIN PERMEATION OF THE MOLECULE IN FULL THICKNESS PORCINE SKIN IN VITRO WAS INVESTIGATED USING FRANZ-TYPE DIFFUSION CELLS. THE MELTING POINT, LOG P(O/W) VALUE AND PKA VALUE OF EA WERE DETERMINED TO BE 114.39 0.5 C, 1.07 0.03 AND 7.72 0.01 RESPECTIVELY. SKIN PENETRATION OF EA WAS EVIDENT FOR THE FOLLOWING VEHICLES 1,2 HEXANEDIOL (HEX), GLYCEROL (GLY), PROPYLENE GLYCOL (PG), 1,2 PENTANEDIOL (1-2P), ISOPROPYL ALCOHOL (IPA), PROPYLENE GLYCOL MONOLAURATE (PGML) AND PROPYLENE GLYCOL MONOCAPRYLATE (PGMC). SKIN UPTAKE BUT NO PERMEATION THROUGH THE SKIN WAS OBSERVED FOR TRANSCUTOL (TC) AND DIPROPYLENE GLYCOL (DIPG), WHILE NO PENETRATION WAS OBSERVED FOR THE SOLVENTS 1,5 PENTANEDIOL (1-5P) AND TRIPROPYLENE GLYCOL (TRIPG). THE FINDINGS OF THE PERMEATION EXPERIMENTS CONFIRM THE POTENTIAL OF SIMPLE FORMULATIONS TO DELIVER EA TO THE SKIN.

NPZ WERE COATED BY INCUBATION AT DIFFERENT GT-TO-ZEIN RATIOS: 2.5% COATING WITH GT (GT-NPZ1), 5% (GT-NPZ2) AND 10% (GT-NPZ3). DURING THE PROCESS, THE GT CONJUGATE FORMED A POLYMER LAYER AROUND THE SURFACE OF ZEIN NANOPARTICLES. FOR GT-NPZ2, THE THICKNESS OF THIS CORONA WAS ESTIMATED BETWEEN 15 AND 20 NM. THESE NANOCARRIERS DISPLAYED A MORE NEGATIVE ZETA POTENTIAL THAN UNCOATED NPZ. THE DIFFUSIVITY OF NANOPARTICLES WAS EVALUATED IN PIG INTESTINAL MUCUS BY MULTIPLE PARTICLE TRACKING ANALYSIS. GT-NPZ2 DISPLAYED A 28-FOLD HIGHER DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT WITHIN THE MUCUS LAYER THAN NPZ PARTICLES. THESE RESULTS ALIGN WITH IN VIVO BIODISTRIBUTION STUDIES IN WHICH NPZ DISPLAYED A LOCALISATION RESTRICTED TO THE MUCUS LAYER, WHEREAS GT-NPZ2 WERE CAPABLE OF REACHING THE INTESTINAL EPITHELIUM.

J. PHARM. X","THE MANUFACTURING OF THE MAJORITY OF SOLID ORAL DOSAGE FORMS IS BASED ON THE DENSIFICATION OF POWDER. A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE POWDER BEHAVIOR IS THEREFORE ESSENTIAL TO ASSURE HIGH QUALITY DRUG PRODUCTS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR THE CAPSULE FILLING PROCESS, WHERE THE POWDER BULK DENSITY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CONTROLLING THE FILL WEIGHT AND WEIGHT VARIABILITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT. IN THIS STUDY WE PRESENT A NOVEL APPROACH TO QUANTITATIVELY MEASURE BULK DENSITY VARIATIONS IN A ROTATING CONTAINER BY MEANS OF TERAHERTZ REFLECTION TECHNOLOGY. THE TERAHERTZ REFLECTION PROBE WAS USED TO MEASURE THE POWDER DENSITY USING AN EXPERIMENTAL SETUP THAT MIMICS A LAB-SCALE CAPSULE FILLING MACHINE INCLUDING A STATIC SAMPLING TOOL. THREE DIFFERENT GRADES OF -LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE EXCIPIENTS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR INHALATION APPLICATION WERE SYSTEMATICALLY INVESTIGATED AT FIVE COMPRESSION STAGES. RELATIVE DENSITIES PREDICTED FROM TERAHERTZ REFLECTION MEASUREMENTS WERE CORRELATED TO OFF-LINE WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS OF THE COLLECTED FILLED CAPSULES. THE PREDICTIONS AND THE MEASURED WEIGHTS OF THE POWDER IN THE CAPSULES WERE IN EXCELLENT AGREEMENT, WHERE THE RELATIVE DENSITY MEASUREMENTS OF LACTOHALE 200 SHOWED THE STRONGEST CORRELATION WITH THE RESPECTIVE FILL WEIGHT (R 2 =0.995). WE ALSO STUDIED HOW THE DENSITY UNIFORMITY OF THE POWDER BED WAS IMPACTED BY THE DOSING PROCESS AND THE SUBSEQUENT FILLING OF THE HOLES (WITH EXCIPIENT POWDER), WHICH WERE INTRODUCED IN THE POWDER BED AFTER THE DOSING STEP. EVEN THOUGH THE HOLES SEEMED TO BE FILLED WITH NEW POWDER (BY VISUAL INSPECTION), THE RELATIVE DENSITY IN THESE SPECIFIC SEGMENTS WERE FOUND TO CLEARLY DIFFER FROM THE UNDISTURBED POWDER BED STATE PRIOR TO DOSING.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROVIDE SOME MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTION OF ELECTROSTATIC REPULSION TO THE VISCOSITY OF PROTEIN SOLUTIONS AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS, ALONG WITH THE EFFECT OF EXCIPIENTS SUCH AS SALTS ON RELATIVE VISCOSITY. PROTEINS ARE TREATED AS CHARGED COLLOIDS IN THIS PAPER. AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS, THE ELECTRICAL DOUBLE LAYER STARTS TO OVERLAP, AND SECONDARY ELECTROVISCOUS EFFECT BECOMES SIGNIFICANT IN ADDITION TO PRIMARY ELECTROVISCOUS EFFECT. IN OTHER WORDS, THE HYDRODYNAMIC VOLUME OF PROTEINS PLAYS A GREAT ROLE IN INFLUENCING THEIR SOLUTION VISCOSITY BECAUSE OF THE EXCLUDED VOLUME EFFECT. CURRENTLY, IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE HIGH VISCOSITY OF CONCENTRATED PROTEIN SOLUTIONS IS ATTRIBUTED TO FORMATION OF CLUSTERS DUE TO EITHER ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION OR HYDROPHOBIC INTERACTIONS, ESPECIALLY FOR MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, IN WHICH ANYBODY MOLECULES IN HIGH CONCENTRATION FORMULATIONS MAY FORM NETWORKS.

RES.","ASCARIS EGGS ARE COMMONLY USED AS INDICATORS FOR PATHOGEN INACTIVATION DURING THE TREATMENT OF FECAL SLUDGE AND WASTEWATER DUE TO THEIR HIGHLY RESISTANT LIPID MEMBRANE AND ABILITY TO SURVIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. CURRENT GUIDELINES SUGGEST THAT THERMAL TREATMENT ALONE CANNOT INACTIVATE ASCARIS EGGS AT TEMPERATURES BELOW 45 C, ALTHOUGH SOME EVIDENCE IN THE LITERATURE SUGGESTS THIS TO BE INCORRECT. HERE, WE PERFORMED A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT TO TEST THE EFFECT OF MESOPHILIC TEMPERATURES ON ASCARIS INACTIVATION. WE EXPOSED ASCARIS SUUM EGGS TO A TEMPERATURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 34C AND 45 C UNDER ANAEROBIC AND AEROBIC CONDITIONS TO OBSERVE THE REQUIRED EXPOSURE TIMES FOR A 3-LOG REDUCTION. INDEED, WE FOUND THAT TEMPERATURES LOWER THAN 45 C DID INACTIVATE THESE EGGS, AND THE REQUIRED EXPOSURE TIMES WERE UP TO TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE SHORTER THAN SUGGESTED BY CURRENT GUIDELINES. RESULTS FROM THE ANAEROBIC EXPOSURES WERE USED TO DEVELOP A TIME-TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIP THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR ASCARIS INACTIVATION AT MESOPHILIC TEMPERATURES. DATA FROM THE LITERATURE DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP IS CONSERVATIVE, WITH FASTER INACTIVATION OCCURRING UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS WHEN ASCARIS EGGS WERE SUSPENDED IN FECAL SLUDGE OR MANURE. A SPECIFIC AEROBIC RELATIONSHIP WAS NOT DEVELOPED, BUT WE DEMONSTRATED THAT AEROBIC CONDITIONS CAUSE FASTER INACTIVATION THAN ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS. THEREFORE, THE ANAEROBIC RELATIONSHIP PROVIDES A CONSERVATIVE GUIDELINE FOR BOTH CONDITIONS. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT RELATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURES CAN CONSIDERABLY IMPACT ASCARIS VIABILITY AND SUGGEST THAT MESOPHILIC TEMPERATURES CAN BE USED IN WASTE TREATMENT PROCESSES TO INACTIVATE PATHOGENS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAFE, LOW-INPUT, MESOPHILIC TREATMENT PROCESSES IS PARTICULARLY VALUABLE FOR ENSURING UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO SAFE SANITATION AND EXCRETA MANAGEMENT. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S)","ASCARIS; FECAL SLUDGE; MESOPHILIC; PATHOGENS; SANITATION; THERMAL INACTIVATION",NA,"ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, CORNELL UNIVERSITY, ITHACA, NY 14853, UNITED STATES; DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY, COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE, CORNELL UNIVERSITY, ITHACA, NY 14853, UNITED STATES; CENTER FOR APPLIED GEOSCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF TBINGEN, TBINGEN, 72074, GERMANY","10.1016/J.WROA.2019.100036","100036","ANGENENT, L.T.HLDERLINGSTR. 12, GERMANY, EMAIL: L.ANGENENTUNI-TUEBINGEN.DE",NA,NA,"25899147",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","5",2019,"none","CORNELL UNIVERSITY;CORNELL UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF TBINGEN","NOTREPORTED",NA,"HARROFF LA, 2019, WATER RES","HARROFF LA, 2019, WATER RES"

THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE SKIN OF BAMA MINI-PIGS, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO HUMAN SKIN, TREATED BY ETHOSOMES HAD A RELATIVELY LOW TM AND ENTHALPY. SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY AND TRANSMISSION ELECTRON MICROSCOPY SHOWED THAT THE MICROSTRUCTURE AND ULTRASTRUCTURE OF STRATUM CORNEUM WAS NOT DAMAGED BY ETHOSOMES TREATMENT.

BY PERFORMING TEMPERATURE VARIABLE TERAHERTZ TIME-DOMAIN SPECTROSCOPY (THZ-TDS) EXPERIMENTS IT IS POSSIBLE TO STUDY THE VIBRATIONAL DYNAMICS OF THESE FORMULATIONS. THE THZ-TDS MEASUREMENTS REVEAL TWO DISTINCT GLASS TRANSITION PROCESSES IN ALL TESTED FORMULATIONS. THE LOWER TEMPERATURE TRANSITION, TG,, IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ONSET OF LOCAL MOTION DUE TO THE SECONDARY RELAXATION WHILST THE HIGHER TEMPERATURE TRANSITION, TG,, MARKS THE ONSET OF THE -RELAXATION. FOR SOME OF THE FORMULATIONS, CONTAINING GLOBULAR BSA AS WELL AS MAB1, THE ABSORPTION AT TERAHERTZ FREQUENCIES DOES NOT INCREASE FURTHER AT TEMPERATURES ABOVE TG,. SUCH BEHAVIOUR IS IN CONTRAST TO OUR PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS FOR SMALL ORGANIC MOLECULES AS WELL AS LINEAR POLYMERS WHERE ABSORPTION IS ALWAYS OBSERVED TO STEADILY INCREASE WITH TEMPERATURE DUE TO THE STRONGER ABSORPTION OF TERAHERTZ RADIATION BY MORE MOBILE DIPOLES. THE ABSENCE OF SUCH FURTHER INCREASE IN ABSORPTION WITH HIGHER TEMPERATURES THEREFORE SUGGESTS A LOCALISED CONFINEMENT OF THE PROTEIN/EXCIPIENT MATRIX AT HIGH TEMPERATURES THAT HINDERS ANY FURTHER INCREASE IN MOBILITY.

NANOCAPSULES FORMULATIONS SHOWED DIFFERENT VALUES OF MEAN PARTICLE SIZE RANGED BETWEEN 175.17 0.31 NM AND 220.93 2.73 NM, NEGATIVE ZETA POTENTIAL VALUES RANGED BETWEEN 18.7 0.50 MV UP TO 42.53 1.01 MV, AND ENCAPSULATION EFFICIENCIES RANGING FROM 50.36 1.86% AND 85.89 2.40%. THE OPTIMIZED NANO-FORMULATION PRESENTED A NANO-SCALE SIZE OF 181.6 2.17 NM, A MONOMODAL SIZE DISTRIBUTION WITH A POLYDISPERSITY INDEX OF 0.133 0.01, A PH VALUE OF 4.92 AND A ZETA POTENTIAL VALUE OF 40.9 0.93 MV. THE ENCAPSULATION EFFICIENCY OF 85.89 2.40% WAS ACHIEVED. IN ADDITION, MICROSPHERES PRODUCED BY DOUBLE EMULSION, DEMONSTRATED POROUS MICROSPHERES MORPHOLOGY IN THE SIZE OF 1759.00 162.6 NM, PH VALUE OF 5.98, A ZETA POTENTIAL VALUE OF 15.7 1.56 MV AND ENCAPSULATION EFFICIENCY OF 47.52 0.52%. DYNAMIC LIGHT SCATTERING AND SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY WERE PERFORMED TO VERIFY THE SIZE AND THE COLLOIDAL MORPHOLOGY. THERMAL PROPERTIES WERE ASSESSED BY THERMOGRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL SCANNING CALORIMETRY AND THE MEASUREMENTS REVEALED THE THERMAL STABILITY OF THE PARTICLES AND SHOWED THAT THE CRYSTALLINE STATE WAS LESS ORDERED IN NANOCAPSULES. ATTENUATED TOTAL REFLECTANCE FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED RESULTS INDICATED A SLIGHT SHIFT IN THE C[DBND]O BAND OF THE POLYMER FROM 1723 CM1 INDUCED BY THE CHANGE IN ITS CRYSTALLINITY DEGREE DUE TO THE SUCCESSFUL INCORPORATION OF OREGANO WITHIN ITS SHELL. MOREOVER, THE LONG-TERM STABILITY STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT FOR A PERIOD OF 60 DAYS AT 4 2 C, 25 2 C AND 40 2 C. RESULTS SHOWED THAT NANOCAPSULES WERE PHYSICALLY STABLE WITH HIGH CARVACROL RETENTION AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES. HOWEVER WHEN MICROSPHERES WERE THERMALLY TREATED AT 25 C AND 40 C, AN INCREASE IN PARTICLE SIZE WAS OBSERVED. BESIDES, CARVACROL RETENTION DECREASED TO 64.56% AND 61.84% AT 25 C AND 40 C, RESPECTIVELY. FROM GATHERED RESULTS, THE GOOD PHYSICAL STABILITY OF NANOCAPSULES IN LONG-TERM STORAGE WITH HIGH CARVACROL RETENTION STABILITY WERE OBSERVED MAINLY AT 4 C. 2019 ELSEVIER B.V.","BIODEGRADABLE POLYMER; CARVACROL RETENTION; LONG-TERM STORAGE STABILITY; NANOSIZED PHYTOMEDICINE; ORIGANUM VULGARE L.

PARASITOL. X","STRONGYLUS VULGARIS IS CONSIDERED THE MOST PATHOGENIC NEMATODE PARASITE OF THE HORSE. FREQUENT DEWORMING PROGRAMS SINCE THE 1970S HAVE REDUCED THE PREVALENCE OF S. VULGARIS TO LOW LEVELS, BUT TO THE PRICE OF WIDESPREAD BENZIMIDAZOLE RESISTANCE IN THE SMALL STRONGYLES (CYATHOSTOMINAE) AND IVERMECTIN RESISTANCE ESPECIALLY IN THE EQUINE ROUNDWORM PARASCARIS SPP. TO SLOW DOWN THE PROGRESSION OF ANTHELMINTIC RESISTANCE IN SWEDEN, HORSE ANTHELMINTICS WERE MADE PRESCRIPTION ONLY MEDICINE IN 2007 AND SELECTIVE THERAPY PRINCIPLES WERE INTRODUCED. THIS MEANS THAT ONLY INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH EGG EXCRETION OR CLINICAL SIGNS OF HELMINTH INFECTION WERE TREATED INSTEAD OF BLANKET TREATMENT OF ALL HORSES ON A FARM. THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO INVESTIGATE THE PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH S. VULGARIS INFECTION IN SWEDEN TEN YEARS AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF A SELECTIVE THERAPY REGIME. A TOTAL OF 529 FAECAL SAMPLES FROM 106 FARMS WERE COLLECTED DURING MARCH TO JUNE IN 2016 AND 2017. A WEB-BASED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED TO COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT DEWORMING ROUTINES. STRONGYLE FAECAL EGG COUNTS (FEC) WERE PERFORMED BY MCMASTER AND PRESENCE OF S. VULGARIS WAS DEMONSTRATED WITH A SPECIFIC PCR ON INDIVIDUAL LARVAL CULTURES. RESULTS WERE ANALYSED BY MIXED LOGISTIC (S. VULGARIS PREVALENCE) OR LINEAR (FEC) REGRESSION MODELS, WHERE FARM WAS INCLUDED AS RANDOM FACTOR. THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF S. VULGARIS AT INDIVIDUAL AND FARM LEVELS WAS 28% AND 61%, RESPECTIVELY. WE OBSERVED A 2.9 INCREASED ODDS RISK OF S. VULGARIS INFECTION ON FARMS THAT BASED THEIR TREATMENT ON STRONGYLE FEC ONLY AS COMPARED TO FARMS THAT COMPLEMENTED STRONGYLE FECS WITH LARVAL CULTURES OR DEWORMED REGULARLY, 14 TIMES PER YEAR, WITHOUT PRIOR DIAGNOSIS. WE FOUND NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE PREVALENCE OF S. VULGARIS AND STRONGYLE FEC LEVEL, HORSE AGE, GEOGRAPHICAL REGION OR SIGNS OF COLIC. THE PREVALENCE OF S. VULGARIS WAS 25% IN HORSES SHEDDING 150 EGGS PER GRAM. THUS HORSES WITH LOW STRONGYLE FECS THAT ARE LEFT UNTREATED COULD BE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF S. VULGARIS INFECTION. THIS MAY BE AN IMPORTANT REASON FOR THE APPROXIMATELY THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN S. VULGARIS PREVALENCE SINCE 1999 IN SWEDEN. HOWEVER, OUR COMBINED RESULTS INDICATE THAT SELECTIVE THERAPY BASED ON A COMBINATION OF STRONGYLE FECS AND LARVAL CULTIVATION WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF S. VULGARIS INFECTION. STILL, S. VULGARIS NEEDS TO BE MONITORED CONTINUOUSLY AND SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CAREFUL CONSIDERATION WHEN THE TREATMENT FREQUENCY IS REDUCED. 2019 THE AUTHORS","DEWORMING ROUTINES; HORSE; SELECTIVE TREATMENT; STRONGYLUS VULGARIS","ANTHELMINTIC AGENT; BENZIMIDAZOLE; FENBENDAZOLE; IVERMECTIN; MOXIDECTIN; PRAZIQUANTEL; PYRANTEL; ADOLESCENT; ADULT; AGE DISTRIBUTION; ANIMAL EXPERIMENT; ANIMAL HUSBANDRY; ANTIHELMINTHIC THERAPY; ARTICLE; COLIC; CONTROLLED STUDY; FECAL EGG COUNT; FECES ANALYSIS; GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION; HORSE; INFANT; NONHUMAN; POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION; PRESCRIPTION; PREVALENCE; RISK FACTOR; STRONGYLE INFECTION; STRONGYLUS VULGARIS; SWEDEN","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"SWEDISH UNIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES, DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES AND VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH, SECTION FOR PARASITOLOGY, UPPSALA, SWEDEN; NORWEGIAN VETERINARY INSTITUTE, DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY, OSLO, NORWAY; KAROLINSKA INSTITUTET, DEPARTMENT OF MEDICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY AND BIOSTATISTICS, STOCKHOLM, SWEDEN; NATIONAL VETERINARY INSTITUTE, DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, SECTION FOR PARASITOLOGY DIAGNOSTICS, UPPSALA, SWEDEN","10.1016/J.VPOA.2019.100013","100013","OSTERMAN-LIND, E., NATIONAL VETERINARY INSTITUTE, DEPARTMENT OF MICROBIOLOGY, SECTION FOR PARASITOLOGY DIAGNOSTICSSWEDEN, EMAIL: EVA.TYDENSLU.SE",NA,NA,"25901389",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","2",2019,"none","SWEDISH UNIVERSITY OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES;NORWEGIAN VETERINARY INSTITUTE;KAROLINSKA INSTITUTET;NATIONAL VETERINARY INSTITUTE","NATIONAL VETERINARY INSTITUTE",NA,"TYDN E, 2019, VET PARASITOL X","TYDN E, 2019, VET PARASITOL X"

EATING UNDERCOOKED MEAT OF INFECTED ANIMALS, INCLUDING PIGS, HAS BEEN CONSIDERED THE MAJOR TRANSMISSION ROUTE OF T. GONDII TO HUMANS. THEREFORE, IT IS URGENT TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT INTERVENTION MEASURES IN THE PORK MEAT CHAIN TO REDUCE RISKS OF ACQUIRING A T. GONDII INFECTION. PROPOSED MEASURES FOR CONTROL OF T. GONDII IN PIGS INCLUDE SEROLOGICAL TESTING OF PIGS AND AUDITS OF PIG FARMS ON RISK FACTORS FOR T. GONDII INFECTION. SO FAR, THESE IDEAS HAVE NOT BEEN TESTED IN PRACTICE. IN ORDER TO GENERATE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND SEROPREVALENCE OF T. GONDII, AS A BASIS FOR DEVELOPING A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, WE STUDIED THE LONG TERM SEROPREVALENCE OVER YEARS, FARMING SYSTEMS AND REGIONS, AND SEASONAL PATTERNS OF T.

THE SERA WERE TESTED IN AN ELISA FOR THE PRESENCE OF ANTIBODIES AGAINST TOXOPLASMA. IN TOTAL 226,340 SERUM SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AND TESTED DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. THE OBSERVED SEROPREVALENCE VARIED OVER YEARS, WITH THE HIGHEST OVERALL SEROPREVALENCE IN 2014 (2.8%) AND THE LOWEST IN 2016 (1.4%). A HIGHER SEROPREVALENCE WAS OBSERVED IN PIGS FROM ORGANIC FARMS COMPARED TO PIGS FROM CONVENTIONAL FARMS. THE OVERALL RISK OF INFECTION WAS ON AVERAGE 2.63 TIMES SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) HIGHER FOR ORGANICALLY RAISED PIGS THAN FOR CONVENTIONALLY RAISED PIGS.

HOWEVER, EXISTING MODELS FAIL TO PREDICT NUCLEI SIZE DISTRIBUTION OF A RANGE OF SPRAY CONDITIONS TYPICALLY USED IN INDUSTRY. IN THIS PAPER, THE DIMENSIONLESS NUCLEATION NUMBER N IS USED TO DEVELOP TWO NEW NUCLEI SIZE DISTRIBUTION MODELS, ONE EMPIRICAL AND ONE SEMI-MECHANISTIC. THE EMPIRICAL MODEL ASSUMES A LOG-NORMAL DISTRIBUTION (LND), AND THE SEMI-MECHANISTIC MODEL IS BASED ON A APPROACH PROPOSED BY HAPGOOD ET AL. (2009), WHICH APPLIES THE POISSON DISTRIBUTION (PD) FUNCTION. MODELLING PARAMETERS ARE ESTIMATED USING MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS (MCS) DATA. FROM THE MODELS, THE NUCLEI SIZE DISTRIBUTION CAN BE EASILY DETERMINED USING ANALYTICAL EQUATIONS, WHICH SIMPLIFIES THE INCLUSION IN A POPULATION BALANCE MODELLING (PBM) FRAMEWORK. THE RESULTS OF BOTH MODELS ARE ASSESSED USING MCS DATA AS WELL AS EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM LITERATURE. THE EMPIRICAL LND MODEL IS ABLE TO CAPTURE THE MCS RESULTS ACCURATELY, AND THE PREDICTIONS AGREE REASONABLY WELL WITH THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS OVER A WIDE RANGE OF DIMENSIONLESS NUCLEATION NUMBER (0&LT,N&LT,3). THE PREDICTIONS OF THE SEMI-MECHANISTIC MODIFIED POISSON DISTRIBUTION (MPD) MODEL DO NOT AGREE QUALITATIVELY WITH THE MCS OR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE MCS MODELLING ASSUMPTIONS NEED TO CAPTURE THE SPATIAL DROP DISTRIBUTION IN THE SPRAY ACCURATELY, WHILE THE DROP SIZE DISTRIBUTION CAN BE ASSUMED TO BE UNIFORM.

CDI IS A CYCLIC PROCESS TO REMOVE IONS FROM AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS BY TRANSFERRING CHARGE FROM ONE ELECTRODE TO ANOTHER. WHEN MULTIPLE SALTS ARE PRESENT IN A SOLUTION, THE REMOVAL OF EACH IONIC SPECIES CAN BE DIFFERENT, RESULTING IN SELECTIVE ION SEPARATIONS. THIS ION SELECTIVITY IS THE RESULT OF COMBINED EFFECTS, SUCH AS DIFFERENCES IN THE HYDRATED SIZE AND VALENCE OF THE IONS. IN THE PRESENT WORK, WE STUDY ION SELECTIVITY FROM SALT MIXTURES WITH TWO DIFFERENT MONOVALENT IONS, CHLORIDE AND NITRATE. WE RUN ADSORPTION EXPERIMENT IN MICROPOROUS CARBONS (I.E., WITHOUT APPLYING A VOLTAGE), AS WELL AS ELECTROSORPTION EXPERIMENTS (I.E., BASED ON APPLYING A VOLTAGE BETWEEN TWO CARBON ELECTRODES). OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT I) DURING ADSORPTION AND ELECTROSORPTION, ACTIVATED CARBON REMOVES MUCH MORE NITRATE THAN CHLORIDE, II) AT EQUILIBRIUM, ION SELECTIVITY DOES NOT DEPEND STRONGLY ON THE COMPOSITION OF THE WATER, BUT DOES DEPEND ON CHARGING VOLTAGE IN CDI, AND III) DURING ELECTROSORPTION, ION SELECTIVITY IS TIME-DEPENDENT. WE MODIFY THE AMPHOTERIC DONNAN MODEL BY INCLUDING AN ADDITIONAL AFFINITY OF NITRATE TO CARBON. WE FIND GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN OUR EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND THE THEORY. BOTH SHOW VERY HIGH SELECTIVITY TOWARDS NITRATE OVER CHLORIDE, NO3 /CL 10, WHEN NO VOLTAGE IS APPLIED, OR WHEN THE VOLTAGE IS LOW. THE SELECTIVITY GRADUALLY DECREASES WITH INCREASING CHARGING VOLTAGE TO NO3 /CL 6 AT VCH=1.2 V. DESPITE THIS DECREASE, THE AFFINITY-EFFECT FOR NITRATE CONTINUES TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE ALSO AT A HIGH VOLTAGE. IN GENERAL, WE CAN CONCLUDE THAT OUR WORK PROVIDES NEW INSIGHTS IN THE IMPORTANCE OF CARBON-ION INTERACTIONS FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL WATER DESALINATION. 2019 THE AUTHORS","AMPHOTERIC DONNAN MODEL; CAPACITIVE DEIONIZATION; ION ELECTROSORPTION; NITRATE SELECTIVITY",NA,"ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY, WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY, BORNSE WEILANDEN 9, WAGENINGEN, WG 6708, NETHERLANDS; WETSUS, EUROPEAN CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE WATER TECHNOLOGY, OOSTERGOWEG 9, LEEUWARDEN, MA 8911, NETHERLANDS; EVIDES WATER COMPANY, SCHAARDIJK 150, ROTTERDAM, NH 3063, NETHERLANDS; SOFT MATTER, FLUIDICS AND INTERFACES GROUP, FACULTY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE, MEANDER ME 314, ENSCHEDE, AE 7500, NETHERLANDS","10.1016/J.WATRES.2019.114885","114885","DYKSTRA, J.E., DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY, WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY, BORNSE WEILANDEN 9, NETHERLANDS, EMAIL: JOUKE.DYKSTRAWUR.NL",NA,NA,"00431354",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD","31426005","SCOPUS","164",2019,"none","WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY;EUROPEAN CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE WATER TECHNOLOGY;UNIVERSITY OF TWENTE","WAGENINGEN UNIVERSITY",NA,"MUBITA TM, 2019, WATER RES","MUBITA TM, 2019, WATER RES"

THIS PAPER RELATES TO A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON CCD AND NCED GENES THROUGH PHYLOGENY AND CODON USAGE ANALYSIS. THE RESULT OF THE PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS INDICATES A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CCD AND NCED SUBCLASS GENES, WHILE THE RSCU VALUES INDICATE A HIGH PREFERENCE FOR CUC CODON IN BOTH CCD AND NCED GENE FAMILIES. THE MEAN ENC VALUE OF NCED GENES WAS FOUND TO BE 48.76, SUGGESTING A HIGHER CODON BIAS COMPARED TO CCD GENES. HOWEVER, THE ENC-GC3S PLOT SUGGESTS THAT BOTH THE GENE FAMILIES ARE UNDER MUTATIONAL PRESSURE WITH VARIATIONS ACCORDING TO THEIR SPECIES-SPECIFIC ROLE. SIMILARLY, THE MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS ALSO SUGGESTS THAT NUCLEOTIDE MUTATION BIAS INFLUENCES CODON USAGE.

IN ADDITION TO SPATIAL TRANSPORT, THE BE KINETIC EQUATIONS ACCOUNT FOR PARTICLE-PARTICLE COLLISIONS, USING AN ELASTIC HARD-SPHERE COLLISION MODEL, AND THE ARCHIMEDES (BUOYANCY) FORCE DUE TO SPATIAL GRADIENTS OF THE PRESSURE IN EACH PHASE, AS WELL AS OTHER FORCES INVOLVING SPATIAL GRADIENTS (E.G. LIFT). IN THE DERIVATION, THE PARTICLES IN A GIVEN PHASE HAVE IDENTICAL MASS AND VOLUME, AND HAVE NO INTERNAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM (I.E. THE PARTICLES ARE ADIABATIC). THE 'HARD-SPHERE-FLUID' PHASE IS OBTAINED IN THE LIMIT WHERE THE PARTICLE DIAMETER IN ONE PHASE TENDS TO ZERO WITH FIXED PHASE DENSITY SO THAT THE NUMBER OF FLUID PARTICLES TENDS TO INFINITY. THE MOMENT SYSTEM RESULTING FROM THE TWO BE KINETIC EQUATIONS IS CLOSED AT SECOND ORDER BY INVOKING THE ANISOTROPIC GAUSSIAN CLOSURE. THE RESULTING TWO-FLUID MODEL FOR A BINARY, HARD-SPHERE MIXTURE THEREFORE CONSISTS (FOR EACH PHASE ) OF TRANSPORT EQUATIONS FOR THE MASS , MEAN MOMENTUM (WHERE IS THE VELOCITY) AND A SYMMETRIC, SECOND-ORDER, KINETIC ENERGY TENSOR . THE TRACE OF THE FLUCTUATING ENERGY TENSOR IS WHERE IS THE PHASE TEMPERATURE (OR GRANULAR TEMPERATURE). THUS, IS THE TOTAL KINETIC ENERGY, THE SUM OVER OF WHICH IS THE TOTAL KINETIC ENERGY OF THE SYSTEM, A CONSERVED QUANTITY. FROM THE ANALYSIS, IT IS FOUND THAT THE BE FINITE-SIZE CORRECTION LEADS TO EXACT PHASE PRESSURE (OR STRESS) TENSORS THAT DEPEND ON THE MEAN-SLIP VELOCITY , AS WELL AS THE PHASE TEMPERATURES FOR BOTH PHASES. THESE PRESSURE TENSORS ALSO APPEAR IN THE MOMENTUM-EXCHANGE TERMS IN THE MEAN MOMENTUM EQUATIONS THAT PRODUCE THE ARCHIMEDES FORCE, AS WELL AS DRAG CONTRIBUTIONS DUE TO FLUID COMPRESSIBILITY AND A LIFT FORCE DUE TO MEAN FLUID-VELOCITY GRADIENTS. THE CLOSED BE ENERGY FLUX TENSORS SHOW A SIMILAR DEPENDENCE ON THE MEAN-SLIP VELOCITY. THE CHARACTERISTIC POLYNOMIAL OF THE FLUX MATRIX FROM THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL IS COMPUTED SYMBOLICALLY AND DEPENDS ON FIVE PARAMETERS: THE PARTICLE VOLUME FRACTIONS , , THE PHASE DENSITY RATIO , THE PHASE TEMPERATURE RATIO AND THE MEAN-SLIP MACH NUMBER .

THE HYBRID SOLAR DESALINATION SYSTEM INCLUDES PHOTOVOLTAIC THERMAL PANELS, SOLAR DISH CONCENTRATOR, AND HUMIDIFICATION-DEHUMIDIFICATION DESALINATION UNIT. THE HUMIDIFICATION-DEHUMIDIFICATION DESALINATION UNIT COMPRISES A CLOSED-AIR OPEN-WATER FLOW CONFIGURATION, AND THE SOLAR DISH CONCENTRATORS ARE UTILIZED FOR WATER HEATING. EXAMINATION OF THREE DIFFERENT SHAPES OF CAVITY RECEIVER INCLUDING CYLINDRICAL, CUBICAL AND HEMISPHERICAL, AS THE SOLAR DISH ABSORBERS, WAS CARRIED OUT. THERMAL OIL WAS CONSIDERED AS THE SOLAR WORKING FLUID. THE ABSORBED SOLAR HEAT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE DESALINATION UNIT USING A HEAT EXCHANGER. IN THE HYBRID SOLAR DESALINATION, PHOTOVOLTAIC PANELS WERE USED TO GENERATE THE REQUIRED POWER. WATER FLOW WAS CONSIDERED AT THE BACK OF THE PHOTOVOLTAIC PANELS FOR PREHEATING AND IMPROVING THE PHOTOVOLTAIC EFFICIENCY. THE PRINCIPAL AIM OF THE CURRENT STUDY IS TO PROPOSE HYBRID SOLAR DESALINATION SYSTEM TO GENERATE POWER, AND PRODUCE FRESHWATER. THE SOLAR DESALINATION'S PERFORMANCE WAS EXAMINED IN TERMS OF VARIOUS SOLAR DISH PARAMETERS AND DIFFERENT HUMIDIFICATION-DEHUMIDIFICATION DESALINATION PARAMETERS. EXAMINATION OF VARIOUS SOLAR DISH PARAMETERS, INCLUDING THE SOLAR WORKING FLUID'S INLET TEMPERATURE AND THE CAVITY SHAPES, WAS CARRIED OUT. ALSO, SOME HUMIDIFICATION-DEHUMIDIFICATION DESALINATION PARAMETERS, INCLUDING THE WATER TO AIR FLOW RATIO AND THE WATER FLOW RATE, WERE CONSIDERED. THE EFFECTS OF THESE FOUR PARAMETERS WERE INVESTIGATED ON THE WATER PRODUCTION AND THE GAIN OUTPUT RATIO.

CALVARIAL HEMANGIOMAS ARE MAINLY SOLITARY LESIONS COMMONLY LOCATED IN THE FRONTAL AND PARIETAL BONE, HOWEVER, THEY MAY OCCUR IN ANY SKULL REGION. THESE TUMORS INCREASE IN SIZE OVER A PERIOD OF MONTHS TO YEARS BEFORE THEY START SHOWING THEIR FIRST SYMPTOMS SUCH AS HEADACHE, BONE DEFORMITY, AND PATHOLOGICAL FRACTURES. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS WITH OSTEOSARCOMA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. SURGICAL RESECTION WITH A SAFETY MARGIN IS A STANDARD TREATMENT OF THE CRANIAL HEMANGIOMA. FURTHERMORE, RADIOTHERAPY HAS PROVEN TO STOP THE TUMOR'S GROWTH BUT NOT ITS SIZE. CASE DESCRIPTION: WE TREATED AN 11-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO HAD A RARE CASE OF A CAPILLARY HEMANGIOMA LOCATED IN THE CLIVUS BONE. THE PATIENT UNDERWENT 2 ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL RESECTION BECAUSE OF TUMOR RECURRENCE. SURGICAL SAFETY MARGINS ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, BUT THIS PROCEDURE COULD NOT BE PERFORMED BECAUSE OF THE TUMOR'S LOCATION. AFTER THE SECOND RELAPSE, THE ONCOLOGY TEAM DECIDED TO INITIATE RADIOTHERAPY. AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, THE TUMOR REDUCED ITS SIZE AND REMAINED UNCHANGED.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE PERIOPERATIVE FA CHANGE IN PATIENTS WITH CSM AND DETERMINE THE PROGNOSTIC FACTOR. METHODS: TWENTY-EIGHT PATIENTS WITH CSM AND HEALTHY CONTROL SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY. TWENTY PATIENTS (71%) HAD INTRACORDAL HIGH INTENSITY BEFORE SURGERY.

WE REPORT TRENDS IN SIZE, LOCALIZATION, CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND OUTCOMES OF INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS (IAS). METHODS: IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY, A TOTAL OF 200 CLINICAL HISTORIES OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH IAS OVER AN 8-YEAR PERIOD WERE ANALYZED. VARIABLES CONSIDERED INCLUDED AGE, SEX, TOBACCO CONSUMPTION, MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ANEURYSM, COMPLICATIONS, VASOSPASM, AND MORTALITY. QUALITATIVE VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED BY MEASUREMENTS OF ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE FREQUENCY. SMOKING BEHAVIOR, ANEURYSM SIZE, AND ANEURYSM RUPTURE (AR) WERE COMPARED USING 1-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. CATEGORICAL VARIABLES WERE ANALYZED USING PEARSON'S 2 TEST. RESULTS: THE AVERAGE AGE AT PRESENTATION WAS 58 YEARS. THE AVERAGE SIZE OF RUPTURED ANEURYSMS IN THE GENERAL GROUP WAS 2.57.5 MM, AND AR WAS MOST COMMON IN WOMEN (76%) AND IN PATIENTS AGE 5060 YEARS (33%). THE RATE OF VASOSPASM WAS 19%, AND MORTALITY WAS 37%. SMOKERS COMPOSED 32% OF THE COHORT. HEAVY SMOKERS HAD A 57% RATE OF ASAH, WITH AN AVERAGE SIZE OF RUPTURE OF 5 MM.

THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF VASCULAR IMAGING METHODS USED FOR STEREOELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (SEEG) TRAJECTORY PLANNING. COMPUTER-ASSISTED PLANNING (CAP) IMPROVES PLANNING TIME AND TRAJECTORY METRICS. WE AIMED TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT VASCULAR IMAGING PROTOCOLS ON CAP TRAJECTORIES FOR SEEG. METHODS: TEN PATIENTS WHO HAD UNDERGONE SEEG (95 ELECTRODES) FOLLOWING PREOPERATIVE ACQUISITION OF GADOLINIUM-ENHANCED MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MR + GAD), MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY (MRV + MRA), AND DIGITAL SUBTRACTION CATHETER ANGIOGRAPHY (DSA) WERE IDENTIFIED FROM A PROSPECTIVELY MAINTAINED DATABASE. SEEG IMPLANTATIONS WERE PLANNED USING CAP USING DSA SEGMENTATIONS AS THE GOLD STANDARD. STRATEGIES WERE THEN RECREATED USING MRV + MRA AND MR + GAD TO DEFINE THE APPARENT AND TRUE RISK SCORES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH MODALITY. VESSELS OF VARYING DIAMETER WERE THEN ITERATIVELY REMOVED FROM THE DSA SEGMENTATION TO IDENTIFY THE SIZE AT WHICH ALL 3 VASCULAR MODALITIES RETURNED THE SAME SAFETY METRICS. RESULTS: CAP PERFORMED USING DSA VESSEL SEGMENTATIONS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER TRUE RISK SCORES AND GREATER MINIMUM DISTANCES FROM VASCULATURE COMPARED WITH THE TRUE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MR + GAD AND MRV + MRA.

EXPLORING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN STRESSORS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING PLANT RESPONSES IN URBAN ENVIRONMENTS WHERE ELEVATED TEMPERATURES CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH AIR POLLUTION. ACCORDINGLY, 3-YEAR-OLD SPRUCE SEEDLINGS WERE EXPOSED FOR 2 WEEKS TO AERIAL CADMIUM OXIDE (CDO) NPS OF ENVIRONMENTALLY RELEVANT SIZE (862 NM) AND CONCENTRATION (2 105 CM3). WHILE HALF THE SEEDLINGS WERE INITIALLY ACCLIMATED TO HIGH TEMPERATURE (35 C) AND VAPOUR PRESSURE DEFICIT (VPD, 2.81 KPA), THE SECOND HALF OF THE PLANTS WERE LEFT UNDER NON-STRESSED CONDITIONS (20 C, 0.58 KPA). ATOMIC ABSORPTION SPECTROMETRY WAS USED TO DETERMINE CD CONTENT IN NEEDLES, WHILE GAS AND LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY WAS USED TO DETERMINE CHANGES IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY METABOLITES. PHOTOSYNTHESIS-RELATED PROCESSES WERE EXPLORED WITH GAS-EXCHANGE AND CHLOROPHYLL FLUORESCENCE SYSTEMS. OUR WORK SUPPORTS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ATMOSPHERIC CDO NPS PENETRATE INTO LEAVES BUT HIGH TEMPERATURE AND VPD REDUCE SUCH PENETRATION DUE TO STOMATAL CLOSURE. THE HYPOTHESIS THAT ATMOSPHERIC CDO NPS INFLUENCES PHYSIOLOGICAL AND METABOLIC PROCESSES IN PLANTS WAS ALSO CONFIRMED. THIS IMPACT STRENGTHENS WITH INCREASING TIME OF EXPOSURE. FINALLY, WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT PLANTS ACCLIMATED TO STRESS CONDITIONS HAVE DIFFERENT SENSITIVITY TO CDO NPS COMPARED TO PLANTS NOT SO ACCLIMATED. THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT CONSEQUENCES FOR UNDERSTANDING IMPACTS OF GLOBAL WARMING ON PLANTS AND INDICATES THAT ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS OF ELEVATED TEMPERATURES CAN BE DELETERIOUS, THIS MAY LIMIT OTHER FORMS OF PLANT STRESS ASSOCIATED WITH AIR POLLUTION.

MED. INFECT. DIS.","INTRODUCTION: TO ACHIEVE THE GLOBAL GOAL OF CANINE-MEDIATED HUMAN RABIES ELIMINATION BY 2030 THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO SCALE-UP MASS DOG VACCINATION ACTIVITIES IN REGIONS WITH LARGE DOG POPULATIONS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO ACCESS, A COMMON SITUATION IN MUCH OF INDIA. ORAL RABIES VACCINATION MAY ENABLE THE VACCINATION OF FREE-ROAMING DOGS THAT ARE INACCESSIBLE TO PARENTERAL VACCINATION, AND IS CONSIDERED A PROMISING COMPLEMENTARY MEASURE TO PARENTERAL MASS DOG VACCINATION CAMPAIGNS. WHO AND OIE HAVE PUBLISHED DETAILED MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR RABIES VACCINES AND BAITS TO BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE, REQUIRING THAT BAITS MUST NOT ONLY BE WELL-ACCEPTED BY THE TARGET POPULATION BUT MUST ALSO EFFICIENTLY RELEASE THE VACCINE IN THE ORAL CAVITY. FOR ORAL RABIES VACCINATION APPROACHES TO BE SUCCESSFUL, IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP BAITS WHICH HAVE A HIGH UPTAKE BY THE TARGET POPULATION, ARE CULTURALLY ACCEPTED AND AMENABLE TO MASS PRODUCTION. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE INTEREST AND UPTAKE RATES OF MEAT-BASED AND AN EGG-BASED PROTOTYPE BAIT CONSTRUCTS BY FREE ROAMING DOGS IN GOA, INDIA. METHODS: THREE TEAMS RANDOMLY DISTRIBUTED TWO PROTOTYPE BAITS, AN EGG-FLAVOURED BAIT AND A COMMERCIAL MEAT DOG FOOD (GRAVY) FLAVOURED BAIT. THE OUTCOMES OF CONSUMPTION WERE RECORDED AND COMPARED BETWEEN BAITS AND DOG VARIABLES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 209 EGG-BAIT AND 195 GRAVY-BAIT DISTRIBUTIONS WERE RECORDED AND ANALYSED. NO DIFFERENCE (P=0.99) WAS FOUND IN THE PERCENTAGE OF DOGS INTERESTED IN THE BAITS WHEN OFFERED. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DOGS CONSUMED THE EGG-BAIT THAN THE GRAVY-BAIT, 77.5% VERSUS 68.7% (P=0.04). THE RELEASE OF THE BLUE-DYED WATER INSIDE THE SACHET IN THE ORAL CAVITY OF THE ANIMALS WAS SIGNIFICANT HIGHER IN THE DOGS CONSUMING AN EGG-BAIT COMPARED TO THE GRAVY-BAIT (73.4% VERSUS 56.7%, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: THE EGG-BASED BAIT HAD A HIGH UPTAKE AMONGST FREE ROAMING DOGS AND ALSO ENABLED EFFICIENT RELEASE OF THE VACCINE IN THE ORAL CAVITY, WHILST ALSO AVOIDING CULTURALLY RELEVANT MATERIALS OF BOVINE OR PORCINE MEAT PRODUCTS. 2019 BY THE AUTHORS.","BAIT; FREE-ROAMING DOGS; ORAL VACCINATION; RABIES; SACHET",NA,"ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"MISSION RABIES, CRANBORNE, DORSET, BH21 5PZ, UNITED KINGDOM; ROYAL (DICK) SCHOOL OF VETERINARY STUDIES, ROSLIN INSTITUTE, EASTER BUSH CAMPUS, UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH, ROSLIN, MIDLOTHIAN, EH25 9RG, UNITED KINGDOM; MISSION RABIES, TONCA, MIRAMAR, PANJIM, GOA, 403002, INDIA; DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND VETERINARY SERVICES, GOVERNMENT OF GOA, PANJIM, GOA, 403001, INDIA; IDT BIOLOGIKA GMBH, DESSAU, ROSSLAU, 06861, GERMANY; MERCK ANIMAL HEALTH, MADISON, NJ 07940, UNITED STATES; FRIEDRICH-LOEFFLER-INSTITUT, FEDERAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR ANIMAL HEALTH, WHO COLLABORATING CENTRE FOR RABIES SURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH, GREIFSWALD, INSEL RIEMS, 17493, GERMANY; CEVA INNOVATION CENTER GMBH, DESSAU-ROSSLAU, 06861, GERMANY; CEVA SANT ANIMALE, DESSAU-ROSSLAU, 06861, GERMANY","10.3390/TROPICALMED4030118","118","GIBSON, A.D., MISSION RABIESUNITED KINGDOM, EMAIL: ANDYMISSIONRABIES.COM",NA,NA,"24146366","3",NA,"MDPI AG",NA,"SCOPUS","4",2019,"none","UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH;MERCK ANIMAL HEALTH;WHO COLLABORATING CENTRE FOR RABIES SURVEILLANCE AND RESEARCH;CEVA INNOVATION CENTER GMBH","NOTREPORTED",NA,"GIBSON AD, 2019, TROP MED INFECT DIS","GIBSON AD, 2019, TROP MED INFECT DIS"

CURRENTLY, MOST OF ACTION MINING METHODS RELY ON SIMPLE DATA WHICH DESCRIBES EACH OBJECT INDEPENDENTLY. SINCE SOCIAL DATA HAS MORE COMPLEX STRUCTURE DUE TO THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS, A MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT SUCH STRUCTURAL INFORMATION IS NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN THE ACTION MINING PROCESS.

HERE, WE DESCRIBE A MALE PATIENT WITH A POST-MORTEM DIAGNOSIS OF STSL WHO WAS ADMITTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH ADVANCED HEART FAILURE, TENDON XANTHOMAS AND FINDINGS FROM THE FOLLOW UP WITH HIS LIVING FAMILY MEMBERS. METHODS: WE ESTABLISHED A FAMILY PEDIGREE AND PERFORMED WHOLE-EXOME NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING FOR THE PATIENT AND SANGER SEQUENCING OF DNA SAMPLES OBTAINED FROM HIS LIVING FAMILY MEMBERS. PLASMA STEROL (-SITOSTEROL) LEVEL WAS MEASURED BY GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY/MASS SPECTROMETRY. RESULTS: BOTH THE PATIENT AND HIS YOUNGER BROTHER CARRIED A HOMOZYGOUS MUTATION OF P. R263Q (C.788G > A) IN THE ABCG8 GENE. THE PATIENT'S PLASMA PLANT STEROL LEVEL WAS EXTREMELY HIGH (-SITOSTEROL: 107.5 G/ML), AND THE PLASMA -SITOSTEROL LEVEL OF HIS YOUNGER BROTHER WITHOUT TENDON XANTHOMAS WAS ALSO ABNORMALLY HIGH (51.5 G/ML). THE -SITOSEROL LEVELS OF OTHER LIVING FAMILY MEMBERS INCLUDING ONES WITH A HETEROZYGOUS MUTATION OF P. R263Q (C.788G > A) WERE NORMAL (I.E. UNDETECTABLE).

THE STRUCTURE OF THE GLASS RECOVERED TO AMBIENT CONDITIONS FROM A PRESSURE OF 8.2 OR 17.5 GPA WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED BY NEUTRON OR X-RAY DIFFRACTION. THE EXPERIMENTAL WORK WAS COMPLEMENTED BY MOLECULAR DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS USING A NEWLY-DEVELOPED ASPHERICAL ION MODEL. THE RESULTS SHOW NETWORK STRUCTURES BASED PREDOMINANTLY ON CORNER-SHARING TETRAHEDRAL SIO4 UNITS. AT PRESSURES UP TO ~8 GPA, THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE NETWORK CONNECTIVITY AS DESCRIBED BY THE QN SPECIATION, WHERE N DENOTES THE NUMBER OF BRIDGING OXYGEN (BO) ATOMS PER SIO4 TETRAHEDRON.

METHODS: WE INCLUDED STUDIES THAT EVALUATED INFORMATION DISPLAYS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT REAL-TIME CARE DECISIONS IN CRITICAL CARE OR ANESTHESIOLOGY USING SIMULATED TASKS. WE SEARCHED PUBMED AND IEEEXPLORE FROM 1/1/1990 TO 6/30/2018. THE SEARCH STRATEGY WAS DEVELOPED ITERATIVELY WITH CALIBRATION AGAINST KNOWN REFERENCES. INCLUSION SCREENING WAS COMPLETED INDEPENDENTLY BY TWO AUTHORS. EXTRACTION OF DISPLAY FEATURES, DESIGN PROCESSES, AND EVALUATION METHOD WAS COMPLETED BY ONE AND VERIFIED BY A SECOND AUTHOR. RESULTS: FIFTY-SIX MANUSCRIPTS EVALUATING 32 CRITICAL CARE AND 22 ANESTHESIA DISPLAYS WERE INCLUDED. PRIMARY OUTCOME METRICS INCLUDED CLINICIAN ACCURACY AND EFFICIENCY IN RECOGNIZING, DIAGNOSING, AND TREATING PROBLEMS. IMPLEMENTING USER-CENTERED DESIGN (UCD) PROCESSES, ESPECIALLY ITERATIVE EVALUATION AND REDESIGN, RESULTED IN POSITIVE IMPACT IN OUTCOMES SUCH AS ACCURACY AND EFFICIENCY. INNOVATIVE DISPLAY APPROACHES THAT LED TO IMPROVED HUMAN-SYSTEM PERFORMANCE IN CRITICAL CARE INCLUDED: (1) IMPROVING THE INTEGRATION AND ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION, (2) IMPROVING THE REPRESENTATION OF TREND INFORMATION, AND (3) IMPLEMENTING GRAPHICAL APPROACHES TO MAKE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DATA VISIBLE. CONCLUSION: OUR REVIEW AFFIRMS THE VALUE OF KEY PRINCIPLES OF UCD. IMPROVED INFORMATION PRESENTATION CAN FACILITATE FASTER INFORMATION INTERPRETATION AND MORE ACCURATE DIAGNOSES AND TREATMENT. IMPROVEMENTS TO INFORMATION ORGANIZATION AND SUPPORT FOR RAPID INTERPRETATION OF TIME-BASED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN RELATED QUANTITATIVE DATA IS WARRANTED.

OUR STUDY USED AN ENSEMBLE MODEL THAT INTEGRATED MULTIPLE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS AND PREDICTOR VARIABLES TO ESTIMATE DAILY PM2.5 AT A RESOLUTION OF 1 KM 1 KM ACROSS THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES. WE USED A GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODEL THAT ACCOUNTED FOR GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCE TO COMBINE PM2.5 ESTIMATES FROM NEURAL NETWORK, RANDOM FOREST, AND GRADIENT BOOSTING. THE THREE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS WERE BASED ON MULTIPLE PREDICTOR VARIABLES, INCLUDING SATELLITE DATA, METEOROLOGICAL VARIABLES, LAND-USE VARIABLES, ELEVATION, CHEMICAL TRANSPORT MODEL PREDICTIONS, SEVERAL REANALYSIS DATASETS, AND OTHERS. THE MODEL TRAINING RESULTS FROM 2000 TO 2015 INDICATED GOOD MODEL PERFORMANCE WITH A 10-FOLD CROSS-VALIDATED R2 OF 0.86 FOR DAILY PM2.5 PREDICTIONS. FOR ANNUAL PM2.5 ESTIMATES, THE CROSS-VALIDATED R2 WAS 0.89. OUR MODEL DEMONSTRATED GOOD PERFORMANCE UP TO 60 G/M3. USING TRAINED PM2.5 MODEL AND PREDICTOR VARIABLES, WE PREDICTED DAILY PM2.5 FROM 2000 TO 2015 AT EVERY 1 KM 1 KM GRID CELL IN THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES. WE ALSO USED LOCALIZED LAND-USE VARIABLES WITHIN 1 KM 1 KM GRIDS TO DOWNSCALE PM2.5 PREDICTIONS TO 100 M 100 M GRID CELLS. TO CHARACTERIZE UNCERTAINTY, WE USED METEOROLOGICAL VARIABLES, LAND-USE VARIABLES, AND ELEVATION TO MODEL THE MONTHLY STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DAILY MONITORED AND PREDICTED PM2.5 FOR EVERY 1 KM 1 KM GRID CELL. THIS PM2.5 PREDICTION DATASET, INCLUDING THE DOWNSCALED AND UNCERTAINTY PREDICTIONS, ALLOWS EPIDEMIOLOGISTS TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE THE ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECT OF PM2.5.

SNPS WERE SELECTED FROM SIX CANDIDATE GENES: ADRB2, FTO, MC4R, PPARG2, PPARD AND PPARGC1A. REE (VENTILATED HOOD)AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (TRI-AXIAL ACCELEROMETER)WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER THE DIET. GENERAL LINEAR MODELLING INCLUDED GENDER, AGE AND ADDITIONAL RELEVANT COVARIATES FOR ALL PARAMETERS. RESULTS: THE HETEROZYGOTIC GENOTYPE OF FTO WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER AMOUNT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (1.71 MCOUNTS/D, CI 1.621.81)COMPARED TO THE HOMOZYGOTIC MAJOR GENOTYPE (1.50 MCOUNTS/D, CI 1.401.59)(P &LT, 0.001)WHILE THE HOMOZYGOTIC RISK ALLELE GENOTYPE WAS NOT DIFFERENT (1.56 MCOUNTS/D, CI 1.391.74)AT BASELINE, MOREOVER, A SIMILAR PATTERN WAS OBSERVED AFTER ENERGY RESTRICTION. CARRYING THE HOMOZYGOTIC MINOR GENOTYPE OF ADRB2 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A LARGER DECREASE IN REE (P &LT, 0.05)AND GREATER ADAPTIVE THERMOGENESIS (P &LT, 0.05)AFTER WEIGHT LOSS. CONCLUSION: CARRYING THE MINOR ADRB2 ALLELE HOMOZYGOUS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A LARGER DIET INDUCED METABOLIC ADAPTATION IN ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND SUGGEST A CENTRAL ROLE FOR REDUCED LIPID MOBILIZATION. CARRYING THE RISK ALLELE OF FTO HOMOZYGOUS WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AT BASELINE OR AFTER WEIGHT LOSS. HETEROZYGOUS CARRIERS OF ONE FTO RISK ALLELE SHOWED GREATER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEFORE AND AFTER WEIGHT LOSS WHICH MIGHT PROTECT THEM IN PART FROM THE HIGHER OBESITY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FTO. 2019 THE AUTHORS","ADAPTIVE THERMOGENESIS; ENERGY BALANCE; GENETIC PREDISPOSITION; METABOLIC ADAPTATION; WEIGHT LOSS","ALPHA KETOGLUTARATE DEPENDENT DIOXYGENASE FTO; BETA 2 ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; MELANOCORTIN 4 RECEPTOR; PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR ACTIVATED RECEPTOR GAMMA 2; PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR ACTIVATED RECEPTOR GAMMA COACTIVATOR 1ALPHA; ADRB2 GENE; ADULT; ARTICLE; BODY MASS; BODY WEIGHT LOSS; CLINICAL ASSESSMENT; CLINICAL TRIAL; DIET RESTRICTION; FEMALE; FTO GENE; GENETIC ASSOCIATION; GENETIC PREDISPOSITION; GENETIC RISK; GENETIC VARIATION; GENOTYPE; HUMAN; HUMAN EXPERIMENT; LIPID METABOLISM; MALE; MC4R GENE; NORMAL HUMAN; PHYSICAL ACTIVITY; PPARD GENE; PPARG2 GENE; PPARGC1A GENE; PRIORITY JOURNAL; RESTING ENERGY EXPENDITURE; SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM; THERMOGENESIS","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"MAASTRICHT UNIVERSITY, DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN BIOLOGY, NUTRITION AND TOXICOLOGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE MAASTRICHT (NUTRIM), MAASTRICHT, MD 6200, NETHERLANDS; CLINICAL NUTRITION RESEARCH CENTRE (CNRC), SINGAPORE INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL SCIENCES (SICS), AGENCY FOR SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH (A*STAR)AND NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM (NUHS), CENTRE FOR TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE, YONG LOO LIN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, 14 MEDICAL DRIVE #07-02, MD6 BUILDING, SINGAPORE, 117599, SINGAPORE","10.1016/J.GENE.2019.100019","100019","CAMPS, S.G.J.A., CLINICAL NUTRITION RESEARCH CENTRE, A*STAR SINGAPORE INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL SCIENCES, 30 MEDICAL DRIVE, SINGAPORE, EMAIL: STEFAN_CAMPSSICS.A-STAR.EDU.SG",NA,NA,"25901583",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","3",2019,"none","MAASTRICHT UNIVERSITY;TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH (A*STAR)AND NATIONAL UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM (NUHS)","A*STAR SINGAPORE INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL SCIENCES",NA,"CAMPS SGJA, 2019, GENE X","CAMPS SGJA, 2019, GENE X"

ALTHOUGH THE OPTIMAL OPERATION OF THE CONSIDERED HUMIDIFICATION-DEHUMIDIFICATION SYSTEM HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED IN THE PAST AND DESPITE THE SIMPLIFICATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS CHARACTERIZING EQUILIBRIUM THEORY, THE PROPOSED SOLUTION PROVIDES A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE SYSTEM OPERATION, WHICH HAS NOT BEEN OBTAINED YET. FIRST, IT ALLOWS AN EXPLANATION OF THE ASYMMETRY BETWEEN THE HUMIDIFIER AND THE DEHUMIDIFIER, WHICH RESULTS NOT FROM MASS TRANSPORT LIMITATIONS BUT FROM THE FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCE OF THE ENTHALPY OF MOIST AIR ON TEMPERATURE, WHICH IN TURN DEPENDS ON THE FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCE OF THE SATURATION PRESSURE OF AIR. ON THE ONE HAND, HUMIDIFYING AIR BECOMES EASIER WHEN THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES, LEADING TO SIMPLE WAVE INTERACTIONS, TO THE CORRESPONDING SMOOTH TRANSITIONS, AND TO GREATER ENTROPY GENERATION IN THE HUMIDIFIER. ON THE OTHER HAND, DEHUMIDIFYING AIR BECOMES MORE DIFFICULT WHEN THE TEMPERATURE DECREASES, LEADING TO SHOCK INTERACTIONS, TO THE CORRESPONDING SHARP TRANSITIONS, AND TO SMALLER ENTROPY GENERATION IN THE DEHUMIDIFIER. THEN, IT ALLOWS DESCRIPTION OF THE BEHAVIOR OF THE OVERALL SYSTEM (I.E., CONSIDERING THE SOLAR MODULES CONNECTING THE DEHUMIDIFIER AND HUMIDIFIER). OPTIMAL SYSTEM OPERATION IS DEFINED BY DETERMINING THE AIR-TO-WATER MASS FLOW RATE RATIO THAT MAXIMIZES THE PRODUCTIVITY OF FRESH WATER FOR ANY VALUE OF AMBIENT CONDITIONS AND SALINE WATER INLET TEMPERATURE. SUCH A MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY CURVE SEPARATES LOW-PRODUCTIVITY AND HIGH-PRODUCTIVITY REGIONS, WITH A DISCONTINUITY CAUSING A SUDDEN DROP IN PRODUCTIVITY OCCURRING WHEN GOING FROM THE LATTER TO THE FORMER. SUCH A DISCONTINUITY IS WELL EXPLAINED BY EQUILIBRIUM THEORY IN TERMS OF THE OPERATING REGIMES OF THE HUMIDIFIER AND DEHUMIDIFIER. FINALLY, EQUILIBRIUM THEORY IS USED TO DERIVE AN ANALYTICAL APPROXIMATION OF THE OPTIMAL OPERATING CURVE.

THE OBSERVATIONS ALSO SHOW CHEMICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BELOW-CLOUD LAYER, THE TRANSITION LAYER (JUST BELOW-CLOUD), AND THE IN-CLOUD LAYER. COMPARISON BETWEEN THESE LAYERS REVEALED ENHANCED INORGANIC NITRATE IN INTERSTITIAL AEROSOL SAMPLED IN THE TRANSITION AND IN-CLOUD LAYERS COMPARED TO THE BELOW-CLOUD AEROSOL. ENHANCED PARTICLE NITRATE MASS CONCENTRATIONS WERE MORE SIGNIFICANT DURING URBAN INFLUENCED CLOUD EVENTS THAN BIOGENIC INFLUENCED ONES. THE BELOW-CLOUD AND TRANSITION LAYER AEROSOLS WERE CHARACTERIZED BY SIMILAR BIMODAL NUMBER AND MASS SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS, AND WHEN ENTRAINED INTO THE CLOUD, AEROSOLS WITH NUMBER MEAN DRY DIAMETERS OF &GT, 50 NM WERE INCORPORATED INTO CLOUD DROPLETS, SUGGESTING THAT CLOUD SUPERSATURATIONS AT WFM CAN BE QUITE HIGH (&GT,0.6%).

HOWEVER, DELIVERY COST EVIDENCE IS FRAGMENTED AND OF VARIABLE QUALITY, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR POLICYMAKERS, PLANNERS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO UNDERSTAND AND USE. THIS STUDY AIMED TO CONSOLIDATE AND SUMMARIZE THE EVIDENCE ON DELIVERY COSTS, ANSWERING THE QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE UNIT COSTS OF VACCINE DELIVERY ACROSS LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES (LMICS) AND THROUGH A VARIETY OF DELIVERY STRATEGIES? METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF OVER 15,000 PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED RESOURCES FROM 2005 TO 2018 THAT INCLUDED IDCS IN LMICS. WE QUALITY-RATED AND EXTRACTED DATA FROM 61 RESOURCES THAT CONTAINED 410 IMMUNIZATION DELIVERY UNIT COSTS (E.G., COST PER DOSE, COST PER FULLY IMMUNIZED CHILD). WE CONVERTED COST FINDINGS TO A COMMON YEAR (2016) AND CURRENCY (U.S. DOLLARS) TO ENSURE COMPARABILITY ACROSS STUDIES AND SETTINGS. WE PERFORMED A DESCRIPTIVE AND GAP ANALYSIS AND DEVELOPED IMMUNIZATION DELIVERY COST RANGES USING COMPARABLE UNIT COSTS FOR SINGLE VACCINES AND SCHEDULES OF VACCINES. RESULTS: THE MAJORITY OF IDC EVIDENCE COMES FROM LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES AND SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA. MOST UNIT COSTS ARE PRESENTED AS COST PER DOSE AND REPRESENT HEALTH FACILITY-BASED DELIVERY. DISCUSSION: THE COST RANGES MAY BE HIGHER THAN CURRENT ESTIMATES USED IN MANY LMICS FOR BUDGETING: $0.16$2.54 INCREMENTAL COST PER DOSE (INCLUDING ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL, AND FISCAL COSTS) FOR SINGLE, NEWLY INTRODUCED VACCINES, AND $0.75$9.45 FULL COST PER DOSE (ECONOMIC COSTS) FOR SCHEDULES OF FOUR TO EIGHT VACCINES DELIVERED TO CHILDREN UNDER ONE. CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE INCREASED ATTENTION ON IMPROVING COVERAGE AND STRENGTHENING IMMUNIZATION DELIVERY, EVIDENCE ON THE COST OF DELIVERY IS NASCENT BUT GROWING.

TO ESTIMATE VACCINATION COVERAGE AND DOG POPULATION SIZE IN A HAITIAN COMMUNE, 15 SIGHT-RESIGHT COUNTS WERE CONDUCTED OVER TWO DAYS FOLLOWING A GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED VACCINATION CAMPAIGN. METHODS: DOGS RECEIVED TEMPORARY LAMINATED COLLARS AND LIVESTOCK WAX MARKS ON THE HEAD AND SIDES AT THE TIME OF RABIES VACCINATION. AFTER THE VACCINATION CAMPAIGN, PAIRS OF SURVEYORS WALKED PRE-DEFINED ROUTES THROUGH TARGETED NEIGHBORHOODS, PHOTOGRAPHING AND RECORDING CHARACTERISTICS AND LOCATION OF EACH DOG SEEN ON A STANDARDIZED DATA SHEET. ON THE SECOND SURVEY DAY, SURVEYORS RETRACED THE PRIOR DAY'S TRACK, FOLLOWED THE SAME PROCEDURE, AND INDICATED IN ADDITION WHETHER THEY BELIEVED THE DOGS WERE RESIGHTED FROM THE PRIOR DAY. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE FIELD SURVEY, TWO INDEPENDENT EVALUATORS REVIEWED PHOTOGRAPHS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH DOG TO ASSESS WHICH HAD VACCINATION MARKS AND WHICH WERE RESIGHTED.

RESULTS: FIELD-SURVEYORS IDENTIFIED DOGS CONSISTENT WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH EVALUATIONS IN 629 OUT OF 800 INSTANCES (78.6%, COHEN'S KAPPA OF 0.12). DESPITE THIS INCONSISTENCY, THE POPULATION ESTIMATES RESULTING FROM THE FIELD AND FINAL DETERMINATIONS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AT 1,789 (95% CI 1,677 TO 1,901) AND 1,978 (95% CI 1,839 TO 2,118).

AS A FUNDER OF VACCINES, GAVI, THE VACCINE ALLIANCE (GAVI) HAS GOALS FOR ITS MARKET SHAPING EFFORTS, ACHIEVED THROUGH A STRATEGY DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE GAVI SECRETARIAT, UNICEF, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) AND THE BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION (BMGF). A CASE-STUDY OF GAVI'S FIFTEEN-YEAR ENGAGEMENT WITH A VACCINE AGAINST DIPHTHERIA, TETANUS, PERTUSSIS, HEPATITIS B AND HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE TYPE B (PENTAVALENT) PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL RISKS OF TRYING TO INFLUENCE MARKETS. DURING 200118, GAVI DISBURSED US$3.5 BILLION TO SUPPORT USE OF 50 MILLION PENTAVALENT DOSES ANNUALLY BEFORE 2005, INCREASING TO 300 MILLION DOSES ANNUALLY BY 2016. DURING THIS TIME, EIGHT MANUFACTURERS INVESTED IN VACCINE DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING AND THE FIRST TWO MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY CEASED PRODUCTION. FOLLOWING ITS STRATEGY, GAVI IMPLEMENTED COORDINATED MARKET INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MANUFACTURERS, IMPROVING MARKET INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY, RISK-SHARING AGREEMENTS AND INNOVATIVE PROCUREMENT AIMING TO STIMULATE AND CAPITALIZE ON A COMPETITIVE MARKET. IN 2018 SUPPLY ALLOWS 80 MILLION CHILDREN PER YEAR TO BE IMMUNISED, A SIXTEEN-FOLD INCREASE FROM 2005, WITH VACCINE-RELATED COSTS PER CHILD FOR DONORS AND COUNTRIES OF ONE-QUARTER THE 2005 LEVEL. LESSONS LEARNED INCLUDE THE IMPORTANCE OF FRAMEWORKS AND STRATEGIES, THE NEED TO ADJUST INTERVENTIONS WITH CHANGING CONDITIONS, THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF MANUFACTURERS, AND THE POTENTIALLY POWERFUL EFFECTS OF INTERCONNECTED MARKETS. THIS CASE STUDY IS LIMITED BY ITS FOCUS ON A SINGLE HEALTH PRODUCT IN A SPECIFIC MARKET, HOWEVER THE LESSONS CAN INFORM OTHER MARKET SHAPING EFFORTS WHEN TAKEN IN CONTEXT. WHILE COUNTRIES AND CHILDREN HAVE IMPROVED VACCINE ACCESS, RISKS OF FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY AND CONTINUED MANUFACTURER INVESTMENT IN GAVI VACCINE MARKETS ARE BEING MONITORED.

TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE ON THE ECONOMICS OF FIPV, WE ESTIMATED THE COST PER CHILD VACCINATED USING FULL-DOSE IPV COMPARED WITH FIPV IN ROUTINE AND CAMPAIGN SETTINGS. WE EVALUATED THE IMPACT ON COSTS OF ALTERNATIVE DEVICES FACILITATING ID ADMINISTRATION, VACCINE VIAL SIZES, AND PRICES. METHODS: WE USED AN EXCEL-BASED MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE COMMODITY AND DELIVERY COSTS FOR PROVIDING IPV. COMMODITY COSTS INCLUDED VACCINE PRICE PER DOSE ADJUSTED FOR WASTAGE, PRICES FOR VACCINE ADMINISTRATION DEVICES, AND SAFETY BOXES. DELIVERY COSTS INCLUDED STORAGE COSTS AT EACH LEVEL OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN, TRANSPORT COSTS FOR COMMODITIES BETWEEN LEVELS, AND HUMAN RESOURCE COSTS FOR VACCINE ADMINISTRATION. MODEL INPUTS WERE OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS DATABASES AND PUBLISHED LITERATURE. ALL COSTS ARE REPORTED IN 2018 US DOLLARS. RESULTS: IN BOTH CAMPAIGN AND ROUTINE SETTINGS, FIPV HAD A LOWER COST PER CHILD VACCINATED THAN FULL DOSING, DESPITE THE ASSUMED HIGHER VACCINE WASTAGE WITH FIPV IN ROUTINE SETTINGS, AND EVEN WHEN NOVEL ID ADMINISTRATION DEVICES WERE USED. IN ROUTINE SETTINGS, COSTS PER CHILD FULLY VACCINATED WITH FRACTIONAL DOSES WERE 15% TO 48% LOWER THAN THOSE WITH FULL-DOSE DELIVERY ACROSS DIFFERENT VIAL SIZES. THE COST PER CHILD VACCINATED RANGED FROM $1.84 TO $2.65 FOR FRACTIONAL DOSES, DEPENDING ON THE ADMINISTRATION DEVICE, COMPARED WITH $3.57 FOR FULL DOSE, WHEN USING 5-DOSE VIALS. THE MAGNITUDE OF COST REDUCTIONS WITH FIPV RELATIVE TO FULL-DOSE IPV WAS LARGEST WITH SMALLER VIAL SIZES AND HIGHER VACCINE PRICE. CONCLUSION: ADOPTING FIPV CAN REDUCE COSTS PER CHILD VACCINATED COMPARED WITH USING FULL DOSES, ESPECIALLY AS IPV PRICES INCREASE IN THE SHORT TERM AND MORE SO WHEN TWO FULL DOSES COULD BE RECOMMENDED IN THE FUTURE. 2019","COST PER CHILD; COSTING; FRACTIONAL DOSE; FRACTIONAL IPV; IMMUNIZATION; INACTIVATED POLIOVIRUS VACCINE",NA,"ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"PATH, 2201 WESTLAKE AVENUE, SUITE 200, SEATTLE, WA 98121, UNITED STATES; PATH, RUE DE VAREMB 7, GENEVA, 1202, SWITZERLAND; BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION, 500 FIFTH AVENUE NORTH, SEATTLE, WA 98109, UNITED STATES","10.1016/J.JVACX.2019.100032","100032","MVUNDURA, M., PATH, 2201 WESTLAKE AVENUE, SUITE 200, UNITED STATES, EMAIL: MMVUNDURAPATH.ORG",NA,NA,"25901362",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","2",2019,"none","BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION","NOTREPORTED",NA,"MVUNDURA M, 2019, VACCINE X","MVUNDURA M, 2019, VACCINE X"

THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES IN THE SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND FACTORS OF IMPORTANCE IN MOTHERS DECISION TO HAVE OR NOT TO HAVE THEIR ADOLESCENT DAUGHTERS VACCINATED AGAINST HPV. METHODS: THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS BASED ON SURVEY AND REGISTER DATA FROM 3,558 MOTHERS OF DAUGHTERS BORN IN 2003 LIVING IN THE CENTRAL DENMARK REGION. THE SURVEY EXAMINED, AMONG OTHERS, SOURCES OF INFORMATION AND FACTORS OF VALUE IN THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. SOCIOECONOMIC REGISTER DATA WERE RETRIEVED FROM STATISTICS DENMARK. PEARSON'S CHI-SQUARED TEST WAS USED TO DETERMINE DIFFERENCES IN SOCIOECONOMIC DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN BOTH RESPONDENTS AND NON-RESPONDENTS, AND MOTHERS WHO HAD THEIR DAUGHTERS VACCINATED VERSUS THOSE WHO DID NOT. ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN VACCINATION STATUS AND VARIOUS EVENTS WERE ESTIMATED USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION. RESULTS: A STRONG ASSOCIATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN VACCINE UPTAKE AND GENERAL PRACTITIONER (GP) RECOMMENDATION (ODDS RATIO (OR) 0.17, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 0.10, 0.30), SEEKING GP GUIDANCE (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50, 0.78) AND AGREEING WITH THE DAUGHTER'S FATHER TO VACCINATE (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.37, 0.96).

WE CONDUCTED A RAPID EVIDENCE APPRAISAL ON: THE RISK OF INFLUENZA IN HWS, TRANSMISSION RISK FROM HWS TO PATIENTS, THE BENEFIT OF HW VACCINATION, AND STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING UPTAKE. WE AIMED TO CAPTURE A WHOLE-OF-SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE TO CONSIDER POSSIBLE BENEFITS FOR HWS, EMPLOYERS AND PATIENTS. METHODS: WE EXECUTED A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH OF THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE PUBLISHED FROM 2006 TO 2018 IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. WE DEVELOPED SEARCH TERMS FOR SEVEN SEPARATE QUESTIONS FOLLOWING THE PICO FRAMEWORK (POPULATION, INTERVENTION, COMPARATORS, OUTCOMES) AND QUERIED NINE DATABASES. RESULTS: OF 3784 PUBLICATIONS IDENTIFIED, 52 MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. SEVEN ADDRESSED HW INFLUENZA RISK, OF WHICH FOUR FOUND INCREASED RISK, 15 ADDRESSED INFLUENZA VACCINE BENEFIT TO HWS OR THEIR EMPLOYERS, OF WHICH 10 FOUND BENEFIT, 11 ADDRESSED INFLUENZA TRANSMISSION FROM HWS TO PATIENTS, OF WHICH 6 FOUND EVIDENCE FOR TRANSMISSION, 12 UNIQUE STUDIES ADDRESSED WHETHER VACCINATING HWS PRODUCED PATIENT BENEFIT, OF WHICH 9 CONCLUDED BENEFITS ACCRUED.

CURRENTLY, THE MOST WIDELY USED METHODS FOR TAR REFORMING ARE CATALYTIC REFORMING AND PLASMA REFORMING. HOWEVER, THE MAIN DRAWBACKS FOR THESE TWO PROCESSES ARE: (I) THE RAPID CATALYST DEACTIVATION CAUSED BY POISONING, SINTERING AND COKE DEPOSITION FOR CATALYTIC REFORMING, AND (II) LOW ENERGY EFFICIENCY, LOW SELECTIVITY OF SYNGAS AND THE FORMATION OF UNDESIRABLE BYPRODUCTS FOR PLASMA REFORMING. RECENTLY, THEREFORE, THE HYBRID PLASMA-CATALYSIS SYSTEM HAS ATTRACTED MUCH ATTENTION FOR TAR REFORMING, SINCE IT CAN OVERCOME THE ABOVE-MENTIONED DRAWBACKS AND GENERATE A SYNERGY EFFECT.

IN PARTICULAR, THE EFFECT OF FLUID MEDIUM (AIR, WATER) AGAINST DRY GRANULAR SIMULATIONS ON THE DEVELOPED STRESSES IS ASSESSED. CFD-DEM SIMULATIONS ARE PERFORMED FOR A PERIODIC SHEAR BOX FOR A RANGE OF SHEAR RATES AND VOLUME FRACTIONS OF PARTICLES. THE DEPENDENCE OF RHEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES LIKE SHEAR STRESS, NORMAL STRESS DIFFERENCE, PRESSURE AND RELATIVE VISCOSITY ON VOLUME FRACTION, SHEAR RATE, GRANULAR TEMPERATURE AND THE PARTICLE ORIENTATION ARE DISCUSSED. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE MACROSCOPIC RHEOLOGY OF SUSPENSIONS OF RODS AND DEMONSTRATE THAT THE EFFECT OF PARTICLE SHAPE AND SURROUNDING FLUID CANNOT BE COMPLETELY IGNORED. AIR AS A FLUID MEDIUM SHOWS SIMILAR SCALING AS COMPARED TO DRY GRANULAR SIMULATIONS, BUT THE STRESS VALUES ARE GENERALLY LOWER.

TO DATE, IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE FACTORS INDICATIVE OF THE AGING PROCESS AND THE LOSS OF VIABILITY OF BEECH SEEDS DURING STORAGE. TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ECONOMIC CHALLENGE AND INTERESTING SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM, WE ANALYZED THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE REDOX STATE DURING THE DEVELOPMENT AND STORAGE OF SEEDS. MANY METABOLIC PROCESSES ARE BASED ON REDUCTION AND OXIDATION REACTIONS. THIOL PROTEINS CONTROL AND REACT TO THE REDOX STATE IN THE CELLS. THE LEVEL OF THIOL PROTEINS INCREASED DURING SEED MATURATION AND DECREASED DURING STORAGE. GEL-BASED REDOX PROTEOMICS IDENTIFIED 17 PROTEINS IN BEECH SEEDS DURING DEVELOPMENT. THE PROTEINS COULD BE ASSIGNED TO PROCESSES LIKE METABOLISM AND ANTIOXIDANT FUNCTIONS.

CONTINUOUS FLOW TESTS SHOWED THAT MRSF POSSESSED A HIGH ACCURACY (0.2 M/S)AND EXCELLENT SENSITIVITY (0.1447/MS1). A MODEL OF SENSOR RESISTANCE AND FLOW VELOCITY WAS ESTABLISHED TO UNFOLD THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE FUNDAMENTALS OF FLUID MECHANICS AND THE MECHANIC FLEXIBILITY OF SENSOR MATERIALS. AN ANALYTICAL MODEL YIELDED A HIGH COEFFICIENT OF DETERMINATION (R2 &GT, 0.93)FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RESISTANCE INCREMENT OF THE MRSF AND THE SQUARE OF THE FLOW VELOCITY AT THE VELOCITY RANGE OF 0.252 M/S. FURTHERMORE, A TEMPERATURE-CORRECTION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECT OF WATER TEMPERATURE ON THE SENSOR RESISTANCE READINGS.

HOWEVER, DISSECTION OF AN OA CAN BE CHALLENGING, GIVEN ITS ANATOMICALLY TORTUOUS PATH AND THE PRESENCE OF THICK SURROUNDING MUSCLES. THIS VIDEO CAPTURES THE DISSECTION OF THE OA USING AN UNCONVENTIONAL, INSIDE-OUT HARVESTING TECHNIQUE AND THE END-TO-SIDE ANASTOMOSIS OF THE OA TO THE PICA AT THE P3 SEGMENT. THIS WAS PERFORMED IN A 58-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO PRESENTED WITH A SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (HUNT AND HESS GRADE IV) FROM A RUPTURED FUSIFORM ANEURYSM LOCATED AT THE ORIGIN OF THE RIGHT PICA. MAJOR STEPS IN VIDEO 1 DURING THIS CASE INCLUDE 1) DISSECTION AND HARVESTING OF THE OA USING THE INSIDE OUT TECHNIQUE, 2) PLACEMENT OF 2 TEMPORARY CLIPS OCCLUDING THE PICA AND ISOLATING THE P3 SEGMENT, 3) END-TO-SIDE OA-P3 ANASTOMOSIS, AND 4) REMOVAL OF THE TEMPORARY CLIPS AND CONFIRMATION OF THE PICA'S PATENCY USING INTRAOPERATIVE INDOCYANINE GREEN.

THIS CAN BE DONE USING A SAND DAM WHICH CONSISTS OF A REINFORCED WALL CONSTRUCTED DURING THE DRY SEASON ACROSS A SEASONAL RIVERBED. HOWEVER IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THEIR MAIN UTILITY IS TO STORE WATER IN THE SAND THAT IS ALSO TRAPPED BEHIND THEM, OR TO FACILITATE AQUIFER RECHARGE. THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION BY THE CALCULATION OF A WATER BALANCE IN THREE SAND DAMS IN KENYA TO QUANTIFY THE AMOUNT OF WATER TRANSFERRED BETWEEN THE SAND DAM AND THE SURROUNDING AQUIFER SYSTEM. THE COMPONENTS OF THE WATER BALANCE WERE DERIVED FROM EXTENSIVE FIELD MONITORING. WATER LEVEL MONITORING IN PIEZOMETERS INSTALLED ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE SAND DEPOSITS ENABLED CALCULATION OF THE HYDRAULIC GRADIENT AND HENCE THE LATERAL FLOW BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT REACHES OF THE SAND DAM. IN ONE SAND DAM WATER WAS GAINED CONSISTENTLY THROUGH THE DRY SEASON, IN ONE IT WAS LOST, AND IN THE THIRD IT WAS LOST ALMOST ALL THE TIME EXCEPT FOR THE EARLY DRY SEASON IN THE UPPER PART OF THE TRAPPED SAND.

WE PRESENT A CASE OF A PATIENT PRESENTING WITH THIS CONDITION AND THE POSITIVE RESULT IN PAIN IMPROVEMENT AFTER ENDOSCOPIC RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION OF THE SINUVERTEBRAL NERVE. CASE DESCRIPTION: AN 18-YEAR-OLD OLYMPIC RUNNER PRESENTED TO OUR CLINIC WITH BACK PAIN AND LEFT LEG PAIN IN A CLEAR L5 DISTRIBUTION. HE DID NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF TRAUMA. HIS IMAGING DID NOT DEMONSTRATE ANY LESION CAUSING COMPRESSION OF THE LEFT L5 NERVE ROOT AS EXPECTED. HE WAS FOUND TO HAVE A LEFT HEALING L5 PEDICLE FRACTURE AND IPSILATERAL CHRONIC L5 PARS INTERARTICULARIS FRACTURE. HE WAS ALSO FOUND TO HAVE AN IPSILATERAL MINOR LEFT L5-S1 DISK DESICCATION.

DUE TO THE DIFFICULTY OF MEASURING THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3-D) WIND FIELDS, THERE ARE FEW STUDIES FOCUSING ON SHORT-TERM FINE-SCALE SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS IN AEROSOL AND GAS COMPOSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL FRONT PASSAGE. AT THE END OF NOVEMBER 2016, A 3-D COHERENT DOPPLER LIDAR WAS INSTALLED IN FUKUOKA CITY (33.55N, 130.37E), AN URBAN AREA IN JAPAN, AND 3D-WIND FIELDS HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUSLY MEASURED SINCE THEN. TWO LOCAL FRONTS WITH TYPICAL DENSITY CURRENT STRUCTURE WERE OBSERVED ON 3 MAY AND 29 JUNE 2017. ON 3 MAY 2017, THERE WAS A STEPWISE INCREASE IN CONCENTRATIONS OF AEROSOL (PARTICULARLY SMALLER SIZE AEROSOL), BLACK CARBON (BC) AND CARBON MONOXIDE (CO), SUPPOSEDLY OF SURFACE ORIGIN, AT THE PASSAGE OF THE LOCAL FRONT. HOWEVER, O3 CONTENT, WHICH CAN BE HIGHER AT HIGHER ALTITUDES, DECREASED. IN ANOTHER CASE ON 29 JUNE 2017, THERE WAS LIGHT RAIN IN THE EARLY MORNING AND ALL GAS AND AEROSOL CONTENTS WERE LOW BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF THE FRONT. AT THE FRONT PASSAGE, THERE WAS A STEPWISE INCREASE IN AEROSOL, BC AND CO CONTENTS AS ON 3 MAY, ALTHOUGH O3 CONTENT GRADUALLY INCREASED AFTER SUNRISE AND NO CLEAR CHANGE WAS OBSERVED IN O3. VERTICAL AEROSOL OBSERVATIONS BY THE DOPPLER LIDAR INDICATE THAT THE DEPTH OF THE FRONT SYSTEM ON 29 JUNE WAS MUCH THINNER (UP TO 300400 M) THAN THAT ON 3 MAY (UP TO 700 M), AND THE TEMPERATURE DECREASE WAS LARGER THAN ON 3 MAY. THESE FACTS SUGGEST THAT THE MIXING OF AIR MASSES WITHIN THE SYSTEM WITH THOSE ABOVE OR AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM ON 29 JUNE WAS NO STRONGER THAN ON 3 MAY, AND THUS THE AEROSOL AND GAS CONTENTS AT THE GROUND MAY BE STRONGLY AFFECTED BY THE VERTICAL MIXING/DILUTION OF THE SYSTEM AS WELL AS BY LOCAL EMISSION. 2019 THE AUTHORS",NA,"AEROSOLS; CARBON MONOXIDE; DOPPLER EFFECT; MIXING; OPTICAL RADAR; URBAN TRANSPORTATION; ATMOSPHERIC CONSTITUENTS; COHERENT DOPPLER LIDAR; POLLUTANT TRANSPORT; SHORT-TERM VARIATIONS; SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION; STEPWISE INCREASE; TEMPERATURE DECREASE; THREEDIMENSIONAL (3-D); ATMOSPHERIC MOVEMENTS; AEROSOL; AIR MASS; BLACK CARBON; CARBON MONOXIDE; DENSITY CURRENT; DILUTION; DOPPLER LIDAR; MIXING; POLLUTANT TRANSPORT; TEMPERATURE PROFILE; URBAN AREA; AEROSOL; AIR; ARTICLE; ATMOSPHERE; BINOCULAR CONVERGENCE; BOUNDARY LAYER; CIRCADIAN RHYTHM; GAS; HEIGHT; MASS; MEASUREMENT; METEOROLOGY; PHOTOCHEMISTRY; PRIORITY JOURNAL; SEA; VELOCITY; FUKUOKA [KYUSHU]; JAPAN; KYUSHU","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"FACULTY OF SCIENCE, FUKUOKA UNIVERSITY, FUKUOKA, JAPAN; FUKUOKA INSTITUTE FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH, FUKUOKA UNIVERSITY, FUKUOKA, JAPAN; EMERITUS PROF., HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY, SAPPORO, JAPAN; NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES (NIES), IBARAKI, JAPAN; METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, JAPAN METEOROLOGICAL AGENCY (MRI JMA), IBARAKI, JAPAN","10.1016/J.AEAOA.2019.100043","100043","TAKASHIMA, H., FACULTY OF SCIENCE, FUKUOKA UNIVERSITYJAPAN, EMAIL: HISAHIROFUKUOKA-U.AC.JP",NA,NA,"25901621",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","3",2019,"none","FUKUOKA UNIVERSITY;FUKUOKA UNIVERSITY;HOKKAIDO UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES (NIES);METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE","FUKUOKA UNIVERSITYJAPAN",NA,"TAKASHIMA H, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X","TAKASHIMA H, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X"

TO MINIMIZE ANALYSIS TIME, SOLUTES ARE OFTEN GROUPED INTO A SMALL NUMBER OF MIXTURES, HOWEVER, THIS INCREASES THE RISK OF PEAK OVERLAP. WHILE MULTIVARIATE CURVE RESOLUTION METHODS ARE OFTEN ABLE TO RESOLVE ANALYTE SIGNALS BASED ON THEIR SPECTRAL QUALITIES, THESE METHODS REQUIRE THAT THE CHROMATOGRAPHICALLY OVERLAPPED COMPOUNDS HAVE DISSIMILAR SPECTRA. IN THIS WORK, A STRATEGY FOR GROUPING COMPOUNDS INTO SAMPLE MIXTURES CONTAINING SOLUTES WITH DISTINCT SPECTRAL AND, OPTIONALLY, WITH DISTINCT CHROMATOGRAPHIC PROPERTIES, IN ORDER TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL SOLUTE RESOLUTION EITHER CHROMATOGRAPHICALLY OR WITH CURVE RESOLUTION METHODS IS PROPOSED. WE NAME THIS STRATEGY RATIONAL DESIGN OF MIXTURES (RDM). RDM UTILIZES MULTIVARIATE SELECTIVITY AS A METRIC FOR MAKING DECISIONS REGARDING GROUP MEMBERSHIP (I.E., WHETHER TO ADD A PARTICULAR SOLUTE TO A PARTICULAR SAMPLE). A GROUP OF 97 SOLUTES WAS USED TO DEMONSTRATE THIS STRATEGY.

WHEN ONLY SPECTRAL PROPERTIES WERE UTILIZED (I.E., THE CHROMATOGRAPHIC PROPERTIES ARE UNKNOWN AHEAD OF TIME) THE NUMBER OF GROUPS REQUIRED TO AVOID UNRESOLVABLE OVERLAPS INCREASED TO 20.

X","BACKGROUND: DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION OF THE MOTOR THALAMUS OR THE POSTERIOR SUBTHALAMIC AREA (PSA) SHOWS PROMISING RESULTS FOR PATIENTS WITH VOICE TREMOR, ALTHOUGH ONLY FOR ABOUT 50% OF PATIENTS. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT VOICE TREMOR REQUIRES MORE FOCUSED STIMULATION WITHIN THE TARGET AREA COMPARED WITH HAND TREMOR. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFICIENT LOCATION FOR REDUCING VOICE TREMOR WITHIN THE PSA. METHODS: THIRTY-SEVEN PATIENTS WITH ESSENTIAL TREMOR WERE EVALUATED OFF STIMULATION AND IN A SET OF EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS WITH UNILATERAL STIMULATION AT INCREASING AMPLITUDE LEVELS. TWO LISTENERS PERFORMED BLINDED ASSESSMENTS OF VOICE TREMOR FROM RECORDINGS OF SUSTAINED VOWEL PRODUCTIONS. RESULTS: TWENTY-FIVE PATIENTS (68%) HAD VOICE TREMOR. UNILATERAL STIMULATION REDUCED VOICE TREMOR FOR THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS, AND ONLY 6 PATIENTS HAD POOR OUTCOMES. CONTACTS YIELDING EFFICIENT VOICE TREMOR REDUCTION WERE DEEPER RELATIVE TO THE MIDCOMMISSURAL POINT (MCP) AND MORE POSTERIOR RELATIVE TO THE POSTERIOR TIP OF THE SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS (PSTN) (Z MCP=3.1, Y PSTN=0.2) COMPARED WITH POOR CONTACTS (Z MCP=0.7, Y PSTN=1.0). HIGH-AMPLITUDE STIMULATION WORSENED VOICE TREMOR FOR 7 PATIENTS AND INDUCED VOICE TREMOR IN 2 PATIENTS. HAND TREMOR IMPROVED TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN VOICE TREMOR, AND IMPROVEMENTS COULD BE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE TARGET AREA.

X","BACKGROUND: FUSIFORM SUPERIOR CEREBELLAR ARTERY (SCA) ANEURYSMS ARE RARE, AND THEIR MANAGEMENT REPRESENTS A TECHNICAL CHALLENGE. IN COMPLEX ANEURYSMS, ENDOVASCULAR PARENT VESSEL OCCLUSION OF THE SCA MAY BE A TREATMENT OPTION. HERE, WE PRESENT 2 CASES OF FUSIFORM SCA ANEURYSMS, 1 RUPTURED AND 1 UNRUPTURED, AS WELL AS OUR INSTITUTION'S MANAGEMENT WITH PARENT VESSEL OCCLUSION. WE ALSO PROVIDE A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. CASES DESCRIPTION: CASE 1: A 42-YEAR-OLD MALE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM AN OUTSIDE HOSPITAL WITH SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE. ON ADMISSION, THE PATIENT HAD A GLASGOW COMA SCALE SCORE OF 8, A HUNT AND HESS GRADE 4, AND A FISHER GRADE 4. A DIAGNOSTIC ANGIOGRAM DEMONSTRATED A RIGHT SCA FUSIFORM LESION WITH PROXIMAL AND DISTAL DILATATIONS OF 1.45 MM AND 5.35 MM LONG, RESPECTIVELY, LIKELY REPRESENTING A SINGLE DISSECTING PSEUDOANEURYSM. THE DISTAL DILATATION WAS COILED, RESULTING IN PARENT VESSEL OCCLUSION. THE PATIENT RECOVERED CLINICALLY AND WAS DISCHARGED IN STABLE CONDITION. CASE 2: A 27-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WAS TRANSFERRED FROM AN OUTSIDE HOSPITAL DUE TO A BRAINSTEM STROKE. A DIAGNOSTIC ANGIOGRAM REVEALED AN S2/S3 SEGMENT LEFT SCA FUSIFORM LESION, LIKELY REPRESENTING A DISSECTING ANEURYSM. THE PATIENT WAS NEUROLOGICALLY INTACT AT ADMISSION AND MANAGED CONSERVATIVELY. AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP ANGIOGRAM, THE DISSECTION HAD EXTENDED ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE SCA. CONSEQUENTLY, THE PATIENT UNDERWENT COIL EMBOLIZATION OF THE DISTAL LEFT SCA. AT THE 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, THE VESSEL REMAINED OBLITERATED AND THE PATIENT'S NEUROLOGIC STATUS HAD IMPROVED. CONCLUSIONS: ENDOVASCULAR COIL EMBOLIZATION OF FUSIFORM SCA ANEURYSMS OFFERS A REASONABLE AND SAFE TREATMENT APPROACH. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S)","ANEURYSM; CEREBROVASCULAR; FUSIFORM; SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE; SUPERIOR CEREBELLAR ARTERY","MILRINONE; ADULT; ARTERY DILATATION; ARTERY OCCLUSION; ARTICLE; ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA; BRAIN ANGIOGRAPHY; BRAIN ARTERY ANEURYSM; BRAIN INFARCTION; BRAIN STEM; BRAIN VENTRICLE PERITONEUM SHUNT; CASE REPORT; CLINICAL ARTICLE; COIL EMBOLIZATION; COMMUNICATING HYDROCEPHALUS; COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC ANGIOGRAPHY; COMPUTER ASSISTED TOMOGRAPHY; CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT; DISSECTING ANEURYSM; FALSE ANEURYSM; FEMALE; FOLLOW UP; FUSIFORM SUPERIOR CEREBELLAR ARTERY ANEURYSM; GLASGOW COMA SCALE; GUNSHOT INJURY; HOSPITAL ADMISSION; HUMAN; HYPERTENSION; MALE; OSTEOMYELITIS; PARAPLEGIA; PARENT VESSEL OCCLUSION; SUPERIOR CEREBELLAR ARTERY; SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA; VASOSPASM","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"NEUROSURGICAL SERVICE, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, BOSTON, MA, UNITED STATES; DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY, THE NATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTE, KING FAHAD MEDICAL CITY, RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA","10.1016/J.WNSX.2019.100026","100026","ALTURKI, A.Y., NEUROSURGICAL SERVICE, BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOLUNITED STATES, EMAIL: DR.ALTURKI.NEUROSURGERYGMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"25901397",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER INC.",NA,"SCOPUS","3",2019,"none","HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL;THE NATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTE","HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOLUNITED STATES",NA,"ASCANIO LC, 2019, WORLD NEUROSURG X","ASCANIO LC, 2019, WORLD NEUROSURG X"

FIRSTLY, AUNRS SURFACE WERE EMPLOYED AS A PLATFORM FOR THE IMMOBILIZATION OF THIOLATED PROBE DNA, AND THEN HYBRIDIZED WITH DNAZYME CATALYTIC BEACONS. BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF DNAZYME DIGEST, A MOLECULAR BEACON, CAUSES A TURN-OFF SERS SIGNAL BY DISRUPTING THE LABELED PROBES.

SITE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS PEAT HYDRODYNAMIC PROPERTIES, SURFACE VEGETATION PATTERNS, AND HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTING ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY INFLUENCE WATER TABLE DYNAMICS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK WAS TO CHARACTERIZE THE INFLUENCE OF HYDROGEOLOGICAL SETTING AND METEOROLOGICAL CONDITIONS ON WATER TABLE DEPTHS (WTD) AND ON FLUCTUATIONS THEREIN IN SEVEN OMBROTROPHIC PEATLANDS IN OR NEAR THE ST. LAWRENCE LOWLANDS (SOUTHERN QUEBEC, CANADA). UP-GRADIENT, MID-GRADIENT, AND DOWN-GRADIENT LOCATIONS WERE MONITORED IN THE SEVEN PEATLANDS, USING DIPWELLS WITH HOURLY WTD RECORDINGS. WTD WAS ALSO MONITORED IN THE MARGINAL MINEROTROPHIC ZONE FOUND IN THREE OF THE SEVEN PEATLANDS. ADDITIONALLY, HEADS IN THE OUTFLOW (I.E., RECEIVING DIFFUSED WATER FROM THE PEATLAND) AND INFLOW (I.E., PROVIDING DIFFUSED WATER TO THE PEATLAND) ZONES WITHIN THE ADJACENT MINERAL DEPOSITS WERE MONITORED IN SEVEN AND THREE PEATLANDS RESPECTIVELY, USING PIEZOMETERS WITH HOURLY HYDRAULIC HEAD RECORDINGS. HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITIES FOR THE OUTFLOW ZONES RANGED BETWEEN 1.4*107 AND 8.5*103 CM/S, WHEREAS THOSE OF THE INFLOW ZONES RANGED BETWEEN 5.6*107 AND 3.9*106 CM/S. EVAPOTRANSPIRATION WAS SHOWN TO BE THE DOMINANT FACTOR CONTROLLING MONTHLY CUMULATIVE WATER TABLE DECREASES (MCD), WHILE PRECIPITATION DOMINATED THE MONTHLY CUMULATIVE WATER TABLE INCREASES (MCI). A STRONG CORRELATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN MEAN PEATLAND WTD AND OUTFLOW ZONE HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY. PEATLANDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS BEING STRONGLY CONNECTED WITH THE ADJACENT MINERAL DEPOSITS IN A DIFFUSE UNDERGROUND OUTFLOW ZONE SHOWED THE GREATEST VARIATIONS IN WATER STORAGE. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PEATLANDS AND ADJACENT MINERAL DEPOSITS IN CONTROLLING WTD, AS FOUND FOR THOSE LOCATED IN THE ST. LAWRENCE LOWLANDS.

ENVIRON. X","FUGITIVE EMISSIONS OR UNINTENTIONAL LOSSES OF GAS (E.G. LEAKS) ARE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES WITHIN THE OIL AND GAS SECTOR. PREVIOUS WORK HAS DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF A SCALAR TRANSPORT ADJOINT METHOD FOR USING SPARSE SENSOR DATA TO LOCATE AND QUANTIFY MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS UNKNOWN FUGITIVE EMISSION SOURCES WITHIN A BLUFF-BODY DOMINATED FACILITY ENVIRONMENT. THIS PAPER BUILDS DIRECTLY ON THAT WORK AND DEMONSTRATES THE SIGNIFICANT COMPUTATIONAL TIME REDUCTIONS THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY MODIFYING THIS APPROACH TO USE A DATABASE OF PRE-COMPUTED RETRO-TRACERS (PRT). THE COMPUTATIONAL COST, AS WELL AS ESTIMATED SOURCE EMISSION RATES AND LOCATIONS, WERE COMPARED FOR BOTH AN OPEN FIELD RELEASE AND MULTIPLE RELEASES IN A BLUFF-BODY DOMINATED DOMAIN WHEN USING THE PRT METHOD VERSUS THE CONCURRENT GAS TRANSPORT COMPUTATIONS FROM PREVIOUS WORK. FOR THE OPEN-FIELD RELEASE, GIVEN THE SAME WIND INPUT THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN RESULTS OF THE TWO APPROACHES. FOR THE BLUFF-BODY DOMINATED MULTIPLE SOURCE CASE (A DOMAIN REPRESENTATIVE OF AN ACTUAL GAS PLANT), USING SIMPLIFIED WIND FIELDS FOR THE PRT DATABASE GENERATION ALLOWED MAJOR SOURCES TO BE SUCCESSFULLY LOCATED. THE EMISSION RATES WERE COMPUTED WITHIN 75% TO 32% OF THEIR ACTUAL VALUE. WHEN THE WIND DIRECTION COVERAGE WAS INCREASED TO 110 FROM 60, THE EMISSION RATE COMPUTATIONS IMPROVED TO WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 30% TO 25%. THE TOTAL COMPUTATIONAL COST FOR BOTH METHODS WAS OF A SIMILAR ORDER OF MAGNITUDE WHEN INCLUDING THE INITIAL DATABASE GENERATION FOR THE PRT METHOD, BUT NON-REUSABLE COMPUTATIONAL TIME WAS REDUCED BY A FACTOR OF 200600 TIMES MAKING THE PRT METHOD FEASIBLE ON A STANDARD DESKTOP COMPUTER ONCE THE DATABASE IS GENERATED. THIS IS A NOTEWORTHY ACHIEVEMENT AS IT RAISES THE POSSIBILITY OF CONTINUOUS OR NEAR-CONTINUOUS CHARACTERIZATION OF UNKNOWN FUGITIVE EMISSIONS SOURCES WITHIN A COMPLEX FACILITY WHICH COULD ALLOW SOURCES TO BE IDENTIFIED AS THEY ARISE. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S)","ADJOINT; COMPUTATIONAL TIME; FUGITIVE EMISSIONS; LEAK LOCATION; LEAK QUANTIFICATION; OPTIMIZATION; SOURCE CHARACTERIZATION; SOURCE QUANTIFICATION","DATABASE SYSTEMS; GAS INDUSTRY; GREENHOUSE GASES; OPTIMIZATION; PARTICULATE EMISSIONS; ADJOINTS; COMPUTATIONAL TIME; FUGITIVE EMISSIONS; LEAK LOCATIONS; LEAK QUANTIFICATION; SOURCE CHARACTERIZATION; SOURCE QUANTIFICATION; GAS EMISSIONS; ADJOINT METHOD; GAS TRANSPORT; GREENHOUSE GAS; INDUSTRIAL EMISSION; NUMERICAL METHOD; OPTIMIZATION; POLLUTANT SOURCE; SOURCE IDENTIFICATION; ACHIEVEMENT; ARTICLE; GAS TRANSPORT","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"ENERGY & EMISSIONS RESEARCH LAB., MECHANICAL & AEROSPACE ENGINEERING, CARLETON UNIVERSITY, 1125 COLONEL BY DRIVE, OTTAWA, ON K1S 5B6, CANADA; SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS AND STATISTICS, CARLETON UNIVERSITY, 1125 COLONEL BY DRIVE, OTTAWA, ON K1S 5B6, CANADA","10.1016/J.AEAOA.2019.100035","100035","JOHNSON, M.R., ENERGY & EMISSIONS RESEARCH LAB., MECHANICAL & AEROSPACE ENGINEERING, CARLETON UNIVERSITY, 1125 COLONEL BY DRIVE, CANADA, EMAIL: MATTHEW.JOHNSONCARLETON.CA",NA,NA,"25901621",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","3",2019,"none","CARLETON UNIVERSITY;CARLETON UNIVERSITY","CARLETON UNIVERSITY",NA,"BRERETON CA, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X","BRERETON CA, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X"

X","BACKGROUND: ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATIONS (AVMS) ARE A CARDINAL FEATURE OF HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA (HHT). HOWEVER, WHETHER TO TREAT BRAIN AVMS IN PATIENTS WITH HHT REMAINS QUESTIONABLE BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBLE RISKS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH HHT WHO HAD BEEN TREATED FOR BRAIN AVMS AT OUR INSTITUTION FROM JANUARY 1, 2003, TO DECEMBER 31, 2016. AN INSTITUTIONAL DATABASE WAS QUERIED FOR THE PHRASES HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA AND HHT, AND THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD BEEN TREATED DURING THE STUDY PERIOD WERE IDENTIFIED. DATA WERE EXTRACTED REGARDING PRESENTATION, AVM CHARACTERISTICS, TREATMENT MODALITY, AND TREATMENT OUTCOMES. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 14 PATIENTS (10 MALES, 4 FEMALES) WITH HHT WHO HAD HAD AVMS (N=27) FROM THE INSTITUTIONAL DATABASE. THE MEAN AGE OF THE PATIENTS WAS 43 YEARS (RANGE, 264). OF THE 27 BRAIN AVMS, 13 WERE SPETZLER-MARTIN GRADE I, 12 WERE GRADE II, AND 2 WERE GRADE III, NONE WERE GRADE IV OR V. TREATMENT WAS BY MICROSURGERY ONLY (11 AVMS IN 10 PATIENTS), EMBOLIZATION FOLLOWED BY MICROSURGERY (2 AVMS IN 2 PATIENTS), AND RADIOSURGERY ONLY (12 AVMS IN 2 PATIENTS). AVM OBLITERATION WAS ACHIEVED IN 100% OF THE PATIENTS. NO NEW FIXED NEUROLOGIC DEFICITS DEVELOPED AFTER TREATMENT OF UNRUPTURED HHT AVMS. CONCLUSIONS: THE RISK OF TREATMENT OF BRAIN AVMS IN PATIENTS WITH HHT IS QUITE LOW FOR APPROPRIATELY SELECTED PATIENTS WITH TREATMENT INDIVIDUALIZED TO RADIOSURGERY, MICROSURGERY, OR A COMBINATION OF EMBOLIZATION AND MICROSURGERY. 2019 THE AUTHORS","ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION; EMBOLIZATION; HEMORRHAGE; HEREDITARY HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA; RADIOSURGERY","ADOLESCENT; ADULT; ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION; ARTICLE; ARTIFICIAL EMBOLIZATION; ATAXIA; BASAL GANGLION HEMORRHAGE; BRAIN ANGIOGRAPHY; CASE REPORT; CHILD; CLINICAL ARTICLE; ENCEPHALOMALACIA; FEMALE; FOLLOW UP; GAIT DISORDER; GAMMA KNIFE RADIOSURGERY; HEMIPARESIS; HUMAN; INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY; MALE; MICROSURGERY; MIDDLE AGED; NEUROIMAGING; NEUROLOGIC DISEASE ASSESSMENT; NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING; POSTOPERATIVE HEMORRHAGE; RADIATION RESPONSE; RENDU OSLER WEBER DISEASE; RETROSPECTIVE STUDY; SCHOOL CHILD; SENSORY CORTEX; SPETZLER MARTIN GRADE; STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY; TREATMENT OUTCOME; UPPER LIMB","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY, BARROW NEUROLOGICAL INSTITUTE, ST.

WE HAVE ALSO MADE MANY IMPROVEMENTS TO THE STE ALGORITHM, WHICH EXTENDS APPLICABILITY TO COARSER-RESOLUTION OBSERVATIONAL DATASETS. IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE THE USE OF A FULLY-CONNECTED DEEP NEURAL NETWORK MODEL EMULATOR WITH DYNAMICALLY OPTIMIZED ARCHITECTURE AND BETTER GOODNESS-OF-FIT (GOF) METRICS TO MEASURE THE DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MODEL AND OBSERVATIONAL DATA. THE GOF METRICS, WHICH ARE MORE ROBUST AND RESILIENT THAN PREVIOUS METRICS, ARE THE SPEARMAN RANK-BASED CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AND A VARIATION OF THE BINARY F1 CLASSIFICATION SCORE ADAPTED FOR REGRESSION PROBLEMS. USING SYNTHETICALLY GENERATED OBSERVATIONS OVER EAST ASIA, THE SKILL OF THE IMPROVED ALGORITHM IS QUANTIFIED OVER A BROAD RANGE OF SENSOR CONFIGURATIONS AND RELEASE SCENARIOS.

ENVIRON. X","IN MANY CITIES WORLDWIDE, MODERN FLEETS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO REDUCE GASEOUS AND PARTICLE EMISSIONS FROM CITY BUSES. TO DATE, MOST EMISSION STUDIES ARE LIMITED TO A FEW VEHICLES, MAKING A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ASSESSMENT OF CONTROL OPTIONS DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY UNDER REAL-WORLD DRIVING CONDITIONS. EXHAUST EMISSIONS OF 234 INDIVIDUAL CITY BUSES WERE MEASURED UNDER REAL-WORLD STOP-AND-GO TRAFFIC CONDITIONS AT A BUS STOP IN GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN. THE BUSES COMPRISED MODELS FULFILLING EURO III-VI AND EEV (ENHANCED ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY VEHICLE) STANDARDS WITH DIFFERENT ENGINE TECHNOLOGIES, FUELS, AND EXHAUST AFTER-TREATMENT SYSTEMS, AND ALSO INCLUDED HYBRID-ELECTRIC BUSES (HEV). BOTH GASEOUS (NOX, CO, HC, AND SO2) AND SIZE-RESOLVED PARTICLE NUMBER (PN) AND MASS (PM) EMISSION FACTORS (EF) WERE CALCULATED FOR VEHICLES USING COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS (CNG), DIESEL (DSL), RAPESEED METHYL ESTER (RME) AND HYDRO-TREATED VEGETABLE OIL (HVO) EQUIPPED WITH VARIOUS AFTER-TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES, E.G., DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTER (DPF), SELECTIVE CATALYTIC REDUCTION (SCR) AND EXHAUST GAS RECIRCULATION (EGR) SYSTEMS. THE HIGHEST MEDIAN EFPN WAS OBTAINED FROM EURO VHEV-HVO-SCR BUSES (MDEFPN=181014 # KG-1) WHEN THEIR COMBUSTION ENGINES WERE USED THOUGH 53% OF THEIR ACCELERATIONS WERE BELOW DETECTION LIMITS INDICATING THE USE OF THEIR ELECTRICAL ENGINE. THE HIGHEST MDEFPM WAS OBTAINED FROM THE EURO V-DSL-SCR BUSES (MDEFPM=150 MG KG-1) AND THE LOWEST FROM EEV-CNG BUSES (BELOW DETECTION THRESHOLD) AND EURO VIHEV-HVO- SCR+EGR+DPF BUSES (MDEFPM=19 MG KG-1). THE HIGHEST MDEFNOX WAS OBTAINED FROM THE EURO V-RME-SCR (MDEFNOX=30 G KG-1) AND EURO VHEV-HVO-SCR BUSES (MDEFNOX=24 G KG-1), AND THE LOWEST FROM CNG BUSES (MDEFNOX=4.8 G KG-1) AND EURO VIHEV-HVO-SCR+EGR+DPF BUSES (MDEFNOX=7.4 G KG-1). HYBRID BUSES CAN GIVE HIGHER PN EMISSIONS COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL DIESEL ENGINES, LIKELY DUE TO DOWNSIZED COMBUSTION ENGINES. REPLACING DIESEL BY BIODIESEL FUEL REDUCED MDEFPM SIGNIFICANTLY BUT INCREASED MDEFNOX WHICH MAY BE DUE TO THE HIGHER COMBUSTION TEMPERATURE AND OXYGEN CONTENTS OF THE FUEL (FOR RME). OVERALL, THE EEV-CNG BUSES PERFORMED THE BEST REGARDING BOTH THE MDEF AND LOW CONTRIBUTION TO THE HIGH EMITTERS. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT A SMALL (5%) PROPORTION OF THE BUSES CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY (14-30%) TO THE TOTAL EMISSIONS. IDENTIFICATION AND MONITORING THE MAINTENANCE OF THE HIGH EMITTERS IN THE FLEETS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF AIR QUALITY. 2019 THE AUTHORS","COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS (CNG); EMISSION FACTOR; HYBRID-ELECTRIC VEHICLES (HEV); HYDRO-TREATED VEGETABLE OIL (HVO); RAPESEED METHYL ESTER (RME); ROADSIDE MEASUREMENT; VEHICLE EMISSIONS","AIR QUALITY; BUS TRANSPORTATION; BUSES; COMBUSTION; COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS; DIESEL ENGINES; DIGITAL SUBSCRIBER LINES; ESTERS; EXHAUST GAS RECIRCULATION; FLEET OPERATIONS; GAS EMISSIONS; HYBRID VEHICLES; NATURAL GAS VEHICLES; OILSEEDS; ROADSIDES; SELECTIVE CATALYTIC REDUCTION; VEGETABLE OILS; COMPRESSED NATURAL GASSES (CNG); EMISSION FACTORS; HYDRO-TREATED VEGETABLE OIL (HVO); RAPESEED METHYL ESTER; ROADSIDE MEASUREMENTS; VEHICLE EMISSION; AUTOMOBILE ENGINES; CHELATING AGENT; GOLD; NITROGEN; SULFUR; COMBUSTION; DIESEL ENGINE; ELECTRIC VEHICLE; ESTER; MEASUREMENT METHOD; NATURAL GAS; ROADSIDE ENVIRONMENT; TEMPERATURE EFFECT; TRAFFIC EMISSION; ADDITION REACTION; ADSORPTION; ADSORPTION KINETICS; AQUEOUS SOLUTION; ARTICLE; CARBON FOOTPRINT; CHEMICAL STRUCTURE; COST EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; DESORPTION; FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY; ISOTHERM; NUCLEOPHILICITY; PRIORITY JOURNAL; SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY; SYNTHESIS; THERMODYNAMICS; THERMOGRAVIMETRY; THERMOSTABILITY; X RAY PHOTOEMISSION SPECTROSCOPY; GOTEBORG; SWEDEN; VASTRA GOTALAND; VASTRA GOTALAND; BRASSICA NAPUS; VILYUISK HUMAN ENCEPHALOMYELITIS VIRUS","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY, HONG KONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, CHINA; IVL SWEDISH ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN; DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF GOTHENBURG, GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN; SCHOOL OF ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT, CITY UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG, HONG KONG, CHINA","10.1016/J.AEAOA.2019.100044","100044","HALLQUIST, .M., IVL SWEDISH ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH INSTITUTESWEDEN, EMAIL: ASA.HALLQUISTIVL.SE",NA,NA,"25901621",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","3",2019,"none","HONG KONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;IVL SWEDISH ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE;UNIVERSITY OF GOTHENBURG;CITY UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG","IVL SWEDISH ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH INSTITUTESWEDEN",NA,"LIU Q, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X","LIU Q, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X"

UNCLEAR MARGINS, EDEMATOUS AREAS, AND INFILTRATIVE BEHAVIOR ARE THE MAIN CAUSES FOR FAILING GROSS TOTAL REMOVALS. ALSO, EXCESSIVE RESECTION OF PERI-TUMORAL TISSUE OFTEN CARRIES RISKS OF DAMAGING THE NEARBY FUNCTIONING CORTICAL AND SUBCORTICAL STRUCTURES WITH AN UNACCEPTABLE DECREASE IN PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE AND POSTOPERATIVE FUNCTIONAL STATUS, AND THE RISK OF MAKING PATIENTS NOT ELIGIBLE TO ADJUVANT TREATMENTS. AWAKE SURGERY AND INTRAOPERATIVE MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (IOMRI) ARE AMONG THE MOST EFFECTIVE AIDS IN PREVENTING DAMAGE TO FUNCTIONAL BRAIN WHILE MAXIMIZING THE EXTENT OF RESECTION. METHODS: WE PRESENT OUR SERIES OF 46 PATIENTS OPERATED ON AT SOUTHMEAD HOSPITAL (NORTH BRISTOL NHS TRUST) IN BETWEEN JULY 2014 AND FEBRUARY 2017 USING IOMRI PLUS OR MINUS AWAKE SURGERY. SETTING, PATIENT FEATURES, INDICATIONS, TYPE AND SIZE OF TUMORS, SURGICAL TIMES, EXTENT OF RESECTION, MORBIDITY, AND SURVIVAL ARE ANALYZED AND DISCUSSED. RESULTS: OVERALL, IOMRI CHECK LED TO A +43% RESECTIONS IN GROUP 1 AND +58% IN GROUP 2. IN GRADE 2 TUMORS, GTR WAS 46% IN GROUP 1 AND 55% IN GROUP 2 (41% IN CONTROL GROUP). IN GRADE 3 TUMORS, GTR WAS 57% IN GROUP 1 AND 66% IN GROUP 2 (30% IN CONTROL GROUP). IN GRADE 4 TUMORS, GTR WAS 63% IN GROUP 1, 66% IN GROUP 2 (36% IN CONTROL GROUP). IN TERMS OF THEATRE OCCUPATION, THE USE OF IOMRI ADDED 1/2 OPERATIVE SESSION, THE ADDITION OF AWAKE SURGERY IMPLIED THE USE OF ANOTHER 1/2 OPERATIVE SESSION. MORBIDITY DID NOT DIFFER AMONG THE GROUPS, WITH LOW INCIDENCE OF PERMANENT POST-OPERATIVE DEFICITS (<5%). GROUP 2 OS WAS STATISTICALLY LONGER WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: USING IOMRI TOGETHER WITH AWAKE SURGERY IS DEMANDING FOR THE ANESTHETIC TEAM, STAFF NURSES, AND FOR THE PATIENT.

RECENT PUBLICATIONS ESTIMATE THAT 3040% OF TOTAL ANTHROPOGENIC GREENHOUSE GASES ARE DIRECTLY EMITTED BY URBAN AREAS. THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON CO2, WHICH IS THE MAIN ANTHROPOGENIC GREENHOUSE GAS, AND PRESENTS AN IMPLEMENTATION OF CO2 FLUX MODELLING IN URBAN AREAS WITHIN THE URBAN CANOPY MODEL TOWN ENERGY BALANCE (TEB). HIGHLY WEATHER-DEPENDENT CONTRIBUTORS TO CO2 FLUXES (BUILDINGS AND VEGETATION) ARE EXPLICITLY MODELLED BY TEB USING THE BUILDING ENERGY MODEL (BEM) FOR BUILDINGS AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN SOIL, BIOSPHERE AND ATMOSPHERE (ISBA) FOR URBAN VEGETATION. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS THE IMPACTS OF THE URBAN MICROCLIMATE ON CO2 FLUXES TO BE SIMULATED. NON-WEATHER-DEPENDENT CONTRIBUTORS (TRAFFIC AND HUMAN RESPIRATION) ARE SIMULATED USING SIMPLER APPROACHES. A SENSITIVITY STUDY APPLIED TO THE CENTRE OF TOULOUSE, FRANCE, HIGHLIGHTS THE RELEVANCE OF DETAILED INPUT DATA RELATED TO TRAFFIC, BUILDING USE AND HUMAN BEHAVIOUR TO SIMULATE ACCURATE CO2 FLUXES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT TRAFFIC (48.5%) AND BUILDINGS (42%) ARE THE MAIN CONTRIBUTORS TO THE ANNUAL MEAN CO2 FLUX. A COMPARISON OF THE MODEL RESULTS WITH INDEPENDENT EDDY-COVARIANCE FLUX DATA SHOWS GOOD AGREEMENT WITH A ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR OF 15.3 MOL M2 S1 AND DEMONSTRATES THAT THE MODEL IS ABLE TO REPRODUCE SEASONALLY AVERAGED DAILY CYCLES OF CO2 FLUXES.

TWO RECEPTOR MODELS, PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA) AND POSITIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION (PMF), WERE APPLIED TO DETERMINE TRENDS IN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OC AND EC AT THE PRINCIPAL STUDY SITE, PINNACLE STATE PARK (PSP), BETWEEN 2001 AND 2015. THE PSP RESULTS ARE INTERPRETED IN RELATION TO STATE AND REGIONAL EMISSION AND POLLUTANT TRENDS. MULTI-SITE AVERAGE SO4 CONCENTRATIONS SHOWED A LINEAR RELATIONSHIP TO REDUCTIONS IN ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS OF SULFUR DIOXIDE (SO2) IN NEW YORK, SURROUNDING STATES, AND EASTERN CANADA FROM 6.1 MILLION METRIC TONS IN 1995 TO 1.0 MILLION METRIC TONS IN 2015. ON AVERAGE, 0.5 0.1 G M-3 SULFATE (SO4) ORIGINATED FROM NATURAL SO2 EMISSIONS OR FROM OUTSIDE THE REGION. EMISSION-REDUCTION PROGRAMS YIELDED MEASURABLE REDUCTIONS OF AMBIENT OC, EC, AND SO4 CONCENTRATIONS, BUT OC AND EC IMPROVEMENTS AT PSP WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF BIOMASS-BURNING OC AND EC. BETWEEN 2001 AND 2015, BIOMASS BURNING CONTRIBUTIONS INCREASED THE PSP 20012003 MEAN EC AND OC CONCENTRATIONS BY 1318% AND 2330%, RESPECTIVELY. WITH DECREASES IN OTHER SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS, NET TOTAL REDUCTIONS OF PSP 20012003 MEAN EC AND OC CONCENTRATIONS WERE 3658% AND 2645%, RESPECTIVELY. CONTRIBUTIONS TO PSP EC AND OC DECLINED FROM FOUR SOURCE TYPES: (1) FOSSIL-FUEL COMBUSTION ASSOCIATED WITH SO2, (2) COMBUSTION NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SO2 (TENTATIVELY IDENTIFIED AS MOBILE SOURCES), (3) CRUSTAL OC AND EC, AND (4) SULFATE-ASSOCIATED OC AND EC. SO2-ASSOCIATED FOSSIL-FUEL AND BIOMASS-BURNING OC AND EC CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGHER IN WINTER, SULFATE AND NON-SO2 COMBUSTION OC AND EC CONCENTRATIONS WERE HIGHER IN SUMMER, AND CRUSTAL OC AND EC WERE HIGHER IN SPRING. SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL COHERENCE OF MEAN OC AND EC CONCENTRATIONS, WHICH WAS OBSERVED AS A CONSTANT SLOPE OF ANNUAL-AVERAGE OC-VS-EC ACROSS SITES AND YEARS, INDICATES THAT MULTIPLE SITES WERE INFLUENCED BY SIMILAR EMISSION SOURCE TYPES AND RESPONDED SIMILARLY TO EMISSION REDUCTIONS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD.

LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS BETWEEN THE NORMALIZED CALIPSO AND GEOS-CHEM AECS YIELDED BETTER CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS AND LOWER MEAN RELATIVE DIFFERENCES THAN THE DIRECT COMPARISONS FROM THE ORIGINAL DATA. FINALLY, WE INVESTIGATED THE VERTICAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF AEROSOL COMPONENTS OVER THE NORTH, SOUTH, NORTHWEST AND TIBET REGIONS OF CHINA. OUR FINDINGS ARE SUMMARIZED BASED ON DIFFERENT AEROSOL COMPONENTS AS THE FOLLOWING. DUST AEROSOLS: THE PERCENTAGES OF CALIPSO POLLUTED DUST TO TOTAL DUST IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH REGIONS (50%68% IN DIFFERENT SEASONS) ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE IN THE NORTHWEST AND TIBET REGIONS (25%45%). THUS, THE POLLUTED DUST CLASSIFICATION SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTS OUR COMPARISONS IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH. FOR CALIPSO PURE DUST, ITS CONCENTRATIONS IN THE HIGHER LAYERS ARE LARGER THAN THOSE OF GEOS-CHEM. CONTINENTAL/SULFATE, NITRATE, AND AMMONIUM (SNA) AEROSOLS: THE PERCENTAGES OF CALIPSO CONTINENTAL AEROSOLS TO TOTAL AEROSOLS ARE ALMOST NEGLIGIBLE THROUGHOUT THE FOUR REGIONS (<10%). EVEN INCLUDING THE POLLUTED DUST IN THE CONTINENTAL AEROSOL, THEIR COMBINED CONTRIBUTIONS REMAIN 10% LOWER THAN GEOS-CHEM SNA. THUS, WE FOUND THAT THE CURRENT CALIPSO AEROSOL CLASSIFICATION SCHEME IS LIMITED IN THE DETECTION OF ANTHROPOGENIC AEROSOLS IN CHINA. SOOT AEROSOLS: THE GEOS-CHEM SOOT AEROSOL VALUES ARE A FACTOR OF 24 TIMES LOWER THAN THOSE OF CALIPSO.

LARGE (5085%) REDUCTIONS IN ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS OCCURRED IN THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. AND EASTERN CANADA BETWEEN 1995 AND 2015. SPATIALLY AND TEMPORALLY AGGREGATED AMBIENT CONCENTRATIONS OF O3 PRECURSORS DECLINED STEADILY ALONG WITH EMISSION REDUCTIONS: MULTI-SITE MEAN ANNUAL NITROGEN DIOXIDE (NO2), CARBON MONOXIDE (CO), AND TOLUENE CONCENTRATIONS TRACKED STATE AND REGIONAL EMISSIONS OF OXIDES OF NITROGEN (NOX, NO + NO2), CO, AND VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOC), RESPECTIVELY (R2=0.97, 0.88, AND 0.73), SHOWING LINEAR RESPONSES OF AVERAGE O3 PRECURSOR CONCENTRATIONS TO BOTH STATE AND REGIONAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS. O3 EXHIBITED COMPLEX SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS, INDICATING THAT O3 WAS INFLUENCED NOT ONLY BY THE STEADY DECLINE OF REGIONAL EMISSIONS BUT ALSO BY SUBREGIONAL EMISSION CHANGES, CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROCESSES, AND DAY-SPECIFIC VARIATIONS IN EMISSIONS AND WEATHER. THE STATEWIDE MULTI-SITE MEAN ANNUAL 4TH-HIGHEST DAILY 8-H O3 PEAK DECLINED AT THE RATE OF 0.86 0.14 PPBV Y1 (1.1% Y1). INFLUENCES ON PEAK DAILY 8-H O3 WERE STUDIED USING A LONG-TERM DATA RECORD FROM A RESEARCH SITE AT PINNACLE STATE PARK (PSP), LOCATED NEAR ADDISON, NEW YORK. A GENERALIZED ADDITIVE MODEL (GAM) WAS APPLIED TO SEPARATE THE INFLUENCES OF LOCAL AND REGIONAL EMISSION CHANGES, WEATHER, AND OTHER FACTORS. GAM RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE REDUCTION OF SUMMER O3 PEAK VALUES AND THE OVERALL TRENDS IN O3 AT PSP WERE DUE TO CHANGES IN AMBIENT POLLUTANT LEVELS, RATHER THAN TO TRENDS IN TEMPERATURE OR OTHER METEOROLOGICAL FACTORS.

IN THIS STUDY, AN APPROACH TO HARMONISE THE UNCERTAINTIES OF DIFFERENT ONLINE DATASETS FOR THEIR COMBINED USE IN SOURCE APPORTIONMENT WITH POSITIVE MATRIX FACTORIZATION (PMF) IS PRESENTED. THE CONCENTRATION OF INORGANIC IONS, ORGANIC FRAGMENTS AND TRACE ELEMENTS WERE MEASURED IN A PO VALLEY BACKGROUND SITE USING OFFLINE AND ONLINE METHODS. SIX-HOUR PM 2.5 SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED ON FILTERS AND CHEMICAL ANALYSES WERE CARRIED OUT OFFLINE. PARALLEL HOURLY ONLINE MEASUREMENTS WERE MADE USING THE XACT 625 (CES LLC) XRF ANALYSER AND THE Q-ACSM (AERODYNE RESEARCH INC.) SPECTROMETER. ONLINE AND OFFLINE METHODS PRODUCED COMPARABLE RESULTS FOR THE MAJOR CHEMICAL COMPONENT AND SOME TRACE ELEMENTS, WHILE OTHERS (BA, NI, AS AND SE) SHOWED LIMITED COMPARABILITY BETWEEN THE TWO METHODS. TO ENSURE THE CONSISTENCY OF THE FINAL PMF RESULTS, A MULTISTEP APPROACH WAS ADOPTED. IN THE FIRST STEP PMF WAS RUN WITH ONLY THE OFFLINE DATASET, IN THE SECOND STEP ONLY THE ONLINE ORGANIC DATA WERE USED AND IN A THIRD STEP THE PMF RUN WAS EXECUTED USING ONLY THE ONLINE INORGANIC SPECIES. IN THE FIRST THREE STEPS RUNNING PMF WITH HOMOGENEOUS DATA MADE IT POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THE MAIN SOURCES AND PRODUCE CHEMICAL PROFILES TO BE USED AS INTERNAL REFERENCE FOR THE FINAL FOURTH STEP IN WHICH ALL THE ONLINE SPECIES (MAJOR INORGANIC IONS, M/Z OF ORGANIC FRAGMENTS AND TRACE ELEMENTS) WERE COMBINED. THE SOURCES OF THE FINAL SOLUTION WERE DEVELOPED USING INTERNALLY CONSISTENT CHEMICAL PROFILES AND THOSE FROM THE LITERATURE AND WERE VALIDATED BY ANALYSING THE SOURCE DIURNAL VARIATIONS AND BY COMPARISON WITH EXTERNAL TRACERS.

THE RESULTS SHOWED THE TOTAL ANTHOCYANIN AND THEIR MAIN COMPONENTS IN THE STRAWBERRIES UNDER 35 C WERE GREATLY INCREASED DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT UP-REGULATIONS OF ANTHOCYANIN BIOSYNTHETIC GENES AND TRANSPORTATION GENES. HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURE GREATLY IMPROVED THE ACTIVITIES OF PEROXIDASE (POD) AND ENHANCED GENE EXPRESSIONS OF POD3, POD6 AND POD63. AT THE SAME TIME, HIGH STORAGE TEMPERATURE ACTIVATED LACCASE GENES EXPRESSION INCLUDING LACCASE-9 AND LACCASE-14, WHICH WAS CLOSELY RELATED TO ANTHOCYANIN DEGRADATION. LEVELS OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS) METABOLISM WERE ALSO INCREASED UNDER HIGH AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AT TRANSCRIPT LEVELS.

TO TEST THESE HYPOTHESES, WE CONDUCTED THREE SYNOPTIC WATER CHEMISTRY SAMPLING CAMPAIGNS ACROSS A 25.5-KM2 WATERSHED IN SOUTH-EASTERN IDAHO DURING EARLY SPRING, LATE SUMMER, AND LATE FALL. USING CHANGEPOINT ANALYSIS, WE FOUND THAT DOC VARIABILITY COLLAPSED AT A CONSISTENT LOCATION (WATERSHED AREAS ~1.3 TO ~1.8KM2) ACROSS SEASONS, WHICH COINCIDED WITH THE WATERSHED AREA WHERE VARIABILITY IN STREAMFLOW INTERMITTENCE COLLAPSED (~1.5KM2). TO TEST HYPOTHESIZED MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH INTERMITTENCE MAY AFFECT DOC, WE DEVELOPED TEMPORAL, SPATIAL, AND SPATIO-TEMPORAL METRICS OF STREAMFLOW INTERMITTENCE AND RELATED THESE TO DOC CONCENTRATIONS. STREAMFLOW INTERMITTENCE WAS A STRONG PREDICTOR OF DOC ACROSS SEASONS, BUT DIFFERENT METRICS PREDICTED DOC DEPENDING ON SEASON. SEASONAL CHANGES IN THE EFFECTS OF INTERMITTENCE ON DOC REFLECTED SEASONAL CHANGES FROM INSTREAM TO FLOWPATH CONTROLS. A METRIC THAT CAPTURED SPATIAL CONNECTIVITY TO SOURCES SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED DOC DURING HIGH FLOWS, WHEN DOC IS TYPICALLY CONTROLLED BY TRANSPORT. IN CONTRAST, A REACH-SCALE TEMPORAL METRIC OF INTERMITTENCE PREDICTED DOC DURING THE LATE GROWING SEASON, WHEN DOC IS TYPICALLY CONTROLLED BY INSTREAM PROCESSES AND WHEN LEGACY EFFECTS OF DRYING (E.G., DIMINISHED BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITIES) WOULD LIKELY AFFECT DOC. THE EFFECTS OF INTERMITTENCE ON DOC EXTEND BEYOND TEMPORAL LEGACIES AT A POINT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LEGACY EFFECTS OF INTERMITTENCE DO NOT PROPAGATE DOWNSTREAM IN THIS SYSTEM.

BECAUSE OF CLINOPYROXENE MODAL CONTENTS, THEY ARE GROUPED INTO CPX-RICH LHERZOLITES (CPX 14PERCENTAGE), LHERZOLITES (8 &LT, CPX &LT, 14%), CPX-POOR LHERZOLITES (6 &LT, CPX 8%) AND HARZBURGITES (CPX UP TO 4%), WITHOUT RELEVANT TEXTURAL DIFFERENCES FROM THE MOST FERTILE TO THE MOST DEPLETED LITHOTYPES. THE CPX-RICH LHERZOLITES HAVE MINERAL CHEMISTRY CLOSE IN COMPOSITION TO PRIMITIVE MANTLE (PM), WHEREAS CPX-POOR LHERZOLITE (AND LHERZOLITE) AND HARZBURGITE GROUPS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS A RESULT OF DIRECT MELTING OF THE PM SOURCE. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH LREE, TH AND U CONTENTS, COUPLED WITH A SR ENRICHMENT OF CLINOPYROXENES IN THESE LITHOTYPES, INDICATE THE CIRCULATION OF A SILICATE MELT (WITH CRUSTAL COMPONENTS) IN A VARIABLY DEPLETED MANTLE SECTOR WELL BEFORE THE ENTRAPMENT OF THE XENOLITHS BY THE HOST BASALT. DESPITE THE LARGE DIFFERENCES IN REFRACTORY LITHOPHILE ELEMENT CONTENTS (I.E. CA, AL AND REE), THE EQUILIBRIUM TEMPERATURES NEVER EXCEED 1021 C WITH A CONSTANT DIFFERENCE (&LT,200 C) FROM HARZBURGITES TO CPX-RICH LHERZOLITES.

EPIGENETICS","BACKGROUND: NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT DNA METHYLATION LEVELS IN THE ARYL HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR REPRESSOR (AHRR) GENE MEASURED IN CORD BLOOD ARE SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH PRENATAL TOBACCO SMOKE EXPOSURE AND CAN BE USED AS A FETAL EXPOSURE BIOMARKER. THE MECHANISM DRIVING THIS DEMETHYLATION HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED AND IT IS UNCLEAR IF ALL CORD BLOOD CELL TYPES ARE IMPACTED. NUCLEATED RED BLOOD CELLS (NRBCS/CD235A+ CELLS) ARE DEVELOPMENTALLY IMMATURE RBCS THAT DISPLAY GENOME-WIDE HYPOMETHYLATION AND ARE OBSERVED AT INCREASED FREQUENCY IN THE CORD BLOOD OF SMOKING MOTHERS. WE TESTED IF AHRR METHYLATION LEVELS IN CD235A+ NRBCS OR NRBC COUNTS INFLUENCED AHRR METHYLATION IN WHOLE CORD BLOOD. METHODS: CORD BLOOD WAS COLLECTED FROM SMOKING (N=34) AND NONSMOKING (N=19) MOTHERS AND DNA WAS PREPARED FROM WHOLE CORD BLOOD, ISOLATED CD235A+ NRBCS, AND CD14+ MONOCYTES. AHRR METHYLATION IN CORD BLOOD DNA WAS MEASURED USING ILLUMINA 850K ARRAYS (CG05575921, CHR5:373378). PYROSEQUENCING WAS USED TO COMPARE METHYLATION LEVELS AMONG CORD BLOOD, CD235A+, AND CD14+ CELLS. WE MEASURED NRBC PERCENTAGES USING CONVENTIONAL COMPLETE BLOOD COUNTS AND ESTIMATED PERCENT NRBCS BY A DECONVOLUTION MODEL. RESULTS: METHYLATION LEVELS IN AHRR WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN NRBCS RELATIVE TO WHOLE CORD BLOOD AND CD14+ MONOCYTES. WHILE AHRR METHYLATION LEVELS IN THE CELL TYPES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED ACROSS ALL SUBJECTS, METHYLATION VALUES AT THE CHR5:373378 CPG AVERAGED 14.6% LOWER IN NRBCS (RANGE 0.4 TO 24.8%, P=3.8E-13) RELATIVE TO CD14+, WITH NONSMOKERS SHOWING A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER HYPOMETHYLATION (- 4.1%, P=1.8E-02). METHYLATION LEVEL AT THE AHRR CHR5:373378 CPG WAS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-REPORTED SMOKING IN BOTH CD14+ MONOCYTES (T TEST P=5.7E-09) AND NRBCS (P=4.8E-08), AS WELL AS COTININE LEVELS (REGRESSION P=1.1E-07 AND P=3.6E-04, RESPECTIVELY). FOR SUBJECTS WITH WHOLE BLOOD 850K DATA, ROBUST LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS ADJUSTING FOR ESTIMATED CELL TYPE COMPOSITION, EITHER INCLUDING NRBCS COUNTS OR ESTIMATES, MODESTLY INCREASED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SMOKING AND CG05575921 METHYLATION. CONCLUSIONS: PRENATAL SMOKE EXPOSURE WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AHRR METHYLATION IN CORD BLOOD, CD14+ MONOCYTES, AND CD235A+ NRBCS.

THIS HYBRID CYCLE COMPRESSES THE REFRIGERANT BY USING A CONVENTIONAL COMPRESSOR IN THE LOW-PRESSURE STAGE AND A NOVEL ISOCHORIC COMPRESSION IN THE HIGH-PRESSURE STAGE BY ADDING HEAT IN THE SYSTEM. BETWEEN THE COMPRESSION DEVICES, THERE IS AN INTERCOOLER WHICH IS VITAL FOR REDUCING THE HEAT INPUT DEMAND. THE ISOCHORIC PROCESS IS PERFORMED IN A CLOSED VESSEL WHERE REFRIGERANT PRESSURE INCREASES BY ADDING HEAT, ACCORDING TO THE GAS LAWS. DIFFERENT WORKING FLUIDS ARE STUDIES LIKE CO 2 , R134A, R404A, R152A, R290 AND R32. ACCORDING TO THE FINAL RESULTS, THE ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION IS REDUCED BY THE INCORPORATION OF THE PARTIAL THERMAL COMPRESSION COMPARED TO THE CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM WITH ONLY MECHANICAL COMPRESSION. THE CO 2 AND THE R32 SEEM TO BE THE MOST PROMISING REFRIGERANTS FOR UTILIZATION IN THE NOVEL SUGGESTED CYCLES. FOR THE CASE WITH 75% MECHANICAL COMPRESSION AND 25% THERMAL COMPRESSION, THE ELECTRICITY SAVINGS WITH CO 2 ARE FOUND 15.61% FOR THE CASE WITH THE EVAPORATING TEMPERATURE AT 25 C AND THE HEAT REJECTION TEMPERATURE AT 35 C. MORE SPECIFICALLY, IN THIS SCENARIO FOR 100 KW REFRIGERATION PRODUCTION THERE IS A NEED FOR 47.29 KW ELECTRICITY AND 19.72 KW HEAT INPUT, WHILE THE SYSTEM COP IS 1.492 AND THE EXERGY EFFICIENCY 41.01%. 2019 ELSEVIER LTD","ELECTRICITY SAVINGS; HYBRID CYCLE; ISOCHORIC COMPRESSION; NOVEL REFRIGERATION CYCLE; REFRIGERATION",NA,"ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS, SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, THERMAL DEPARTMENT, HEROON POLYTEHNIOU 9, 157 73 ZOGRAFOU, ATHENS, GREECE; TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY OF STEREA HELLAS, DEPARTMENT OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING ENERGY DEPARTMENT COOLING PROV., AIR-CONDITIONING & ALTERNATIVE ENERGY LABORATORY PSCHACHNA EVIASEVIA 34400, GREECE","10.1016/J.TSEP.2019.04.003",NA,"BELLOS, E., NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS, SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, THERMAL DEPARTMENT, HEROON POLYTEHNIOU 9, 157 73 ZOGRAFOU, GREECE, EMAIL: BELLOSECENTRAL.NTUA.GR",NA,NA,"24519049",NA,"239-248","ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","11",2019,"none","NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS;TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY OF STEREA HELLAS","NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS",NA,"BELLOS E, 2019, THERM SCI ENG PROG","BELLOS E, 2019, THERM SCI ENG PROG"

TO MEET PROCESS VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS, PROCESS CHARACTERIZATION (PC)STUDIES ARE OFTEN PERFORMED TO EXPAND PROCESS UNDERSTANDING AND ESTABLISH AN APPROPRIATE CONTROL STRATEGY THAT ENABLES THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO CONSISTENTLY DELIVER A TARGET PRODUCT PROFILE. TWO KEY ELEMENTS OF THE CONTROL STRATEGY RESULTING FROM PC WORK ARE A LIST OF CRITICAL PROCESS PARAMETERS (CPPS)AND DEFINED OPERATING RANGES (ORS). THESE ARE FREQUENTLY DERIVED BASED ON MATHEMATICAL MODELS DESCRIBING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROCESS PARAMETERS AND CRITICAL QUALITY ATTRIBUTES (CQAS). RISK ASSESSMENT AND DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS (DOE)TECHNIQUES ARE EFFECTIVELY DEPLOYED IN THE INDUSTRY TO IDENTIFY PARAMETERS TO STUDY AND BUILD PROCESS UNDERSTANDING. HOWEVER, TRADITIONAL DATA ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES DO NOT FULLY UTILIZE THE DATA PRODUCED BY THESE STUDIES. IN PARTICULAR, STEPWISE REGRESSION ALGORITHMS BASED ON P-VALUES ARE PRONE TO GENERATE FALSE POSITIVES AND OVERFIT DATA, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO UNNECESSARILY COMPLEX CONTROL STRATEGIES.

CONCLUSION: THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT PASTEURIZED MILK, INDEPENDENT OF THE ORIGIN, CAN CAUSE THE POLARIZATION OF MACROPHAGES FROM A PRO-INFLAMMATORY M1 TOWARDS A PRO-RESOLVING M2 PHENOTYPE.

THE USE OF ADSORPTION SUBSTRATES IS BECOMING A COMMON METHOD FOR P-REMOVAL FROM WASTEWATER. TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINED P-REMOVAL FROM PASSIVE WASTEWATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS, SUCH AS CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO SELECT SUBSTRATES WITH A HIGH CAPACITY TO RETAIN P WHICH CAN BE REPLACED WHEN SATURATED. AN ENRICHED HEMP BIOCHAR SUBSTRATE WAS ADDED TO EXPERIMENTAL CONSTRUCTED WETLAND CELLS TO TREAT DOMESTIC WASTEWATER. HEMP FEEDSTOCK WAS TREATED WITH HEMATITE, MELANTERITE AND DOLOMITE PRIOR TO PYROLYSIS AT 400 C. THE AMOUNT OF P WHICH WAS PRESENT IN THE WASTEWATER FROM THE BIOCHAR WETLANDS CELLS AFTER TREATMENT WAS COMPARED TO GRAVEL CONTROL WETLAND CELLS. DURING THE 7-MONTH STUDY PERIOD, THE WETLANDS CONTAINING THE ENRICHED BIOCHAR CONSISTENTLY REDUCED PO4-P CONCENTRATIONS IN PRIMARY TREATED SEWAGE TO LOWER LEVELS THAN IN THE CONTROL WETLANDS, WITH AN AVERAGE INLET P CONCENTRATION OF 15.5 MG/L, TO BELOW 2 MG/L. VARIOUS ANALYTICAL METHODS WERE USED TO CHARACTERISE THE CHANGES IN THE BIOCHAR SUBSTRATE. CONCENTRATION OF P IN THE SUBSTRATE INCREASED BY 77% OVER THE TEST PERIOD.

WE PROVIDE A THEORETICAL JUSTIFICATION THAT THIS NUMERICAL ALGORITHM HAS A UNIQUE SOLUTION, SUCH THAT THE POSITIVITY IS ALWAYS PRESERVED FOR THE LOGARITHMIC ARGUMENTS, I.E., THE PHASE VARIABLE IS ALWAYS BETWEEN 1 AND 1, AT A POINT-WISE LEVEL. IN PARTICULAR, OUR ANALYSIS REVEALS A SUBTLE FACT: THE SINGULAR NATURE OF THE LOGARITHMIC TERM AROUND THE VALUES OF 1 AND 1 PREVENTS THE NUMERICAL SOLUTION REACHING THESE SINGULAR VALUES, SO THAT THE NUMERICAL SCHEME IS ALWAYS WELL-DEFINED AS LONG AS THE NUMERICAL SOLUTION STAYS SIMILARLY BOUNDED AT THE PREVIOUS TIME STEP. FURTHERMORE, AN UNCONDITIONAL ENERGY STABILITY OF THE NUMERICAL SCHEME IS DERIVED, WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION FOR THE TIME STEP SIZE.

GENOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PARASITE ANTIGEN DISTRIBUTED ALONG THE APPENDAGE LED TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE AAAP (ANAPLASMA APPENDAGE ASSOCIATED PROTEIN) GENE FAMILY LOCATED WITHIN A HIGHLY PLASTIC REGION IN THE GENOME. THE AAAP GENE FAMILY CONSISTS OF AAAP AND SEVERAL ALPS (FOR AAAP-LIKE PROTEINS), DEPENDING ON THE STRAIN. THESE GENES/PROTEINS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY REPEAT SEQUENCES. TO INVESTIGATE LOCUS PLASTICITY, DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE LOCUS WERE CLONED FROM THE SAME STRAIN AS WELL AS FROM DIFFERENT STRAINS, SEQUENCED AND ALIGNED TO IDENTIFY CHANGES. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT REPEAT SEQUENCES BOTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN GENES FACILITATED REARRANGEMENT EVENTS WITHIN THE LOCUS. STRUCTURAL VARIATION OF THE LOCUS IN THE ST.

STUDIES IN RAMP3 KNOCKOUT (KO) MICE REVEAL AN AGE RELATED PHENOTYPE WITH ALTERED METABOLIC REGULATION AND HIGH BONE MASS. TO TRANSLATE THESE FINDINGS INTO A CLINICALLY RELEVANT PERSPECTIVE, WE INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN RAMP3 GENE VARIANTS, BODY COMPOSITION AND BONE PHENOTYPES IN TWO POPULATION-BASED COHORTS OF SWEDISH WOMEN. METHODS: FIVE SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS (SNP) IN THE VICINITY OF THE RAMP3 GENE WERE GENOTYPED IN THE PEAK-25 COHORT (N=1061, 25 YEARS) AND OPRA (N=1044, 75 YEARS). BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD), FAT MASS AND LEAN MASS (TOTAL BODY, REGIONAL) WERE MEASURED BY DXA AT BASELINE, 5 AND 10 YEAR FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: BMD DID NOT DIFFER WITH RAMP3 GENOTYPE IN EITHER COHORT, ALTHOUGH FRACTURE RISK WAS INCREASED IN THE ELDERLY WOMEN (OR 2.695 [95% CI 1.5144.801]). FAT MASS TENDED TO BE HIGHER WITH RAMP3 SNPS, ALTHOUGH ONLY IN ELDERLY WOMEN. IN THE YOUNG WOMEN, CHANGES IN BMI AND FAT MASS BETWEEN AGES 2535 DIFFERED BY GENOTYPE (P=0.001, P < 0.001).

RESULTS: ALL CONTROL PIGLETS (N=12) SHED OOCYSTS AND HAD DIARRHOEA, WHILE PARASITE EXCRETION WAS COMPLETELY SUPPRESSED IN BOTH TREATMENT GROUPS (N=13 EACH) AND DIARRHOEA WAS REDUCED TO A SINGLE ANIMAL (FORCERIS GROUP), RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FOR THESE PARAMETERS BETWEEN THE TREATED GROUPS AND THE CONTROLS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE TREATMENT GROUPS. NO TREATMENT-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS WERE NOTED. BODY WEIGHT GAIN WAS REDUCED IN THE CONTROL GROUP DURING THE ACUTE PHASE OF INFECTION, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER BODY WEIGHT ON THE 15TH DOL. SOWS AND PIGLETS SHED HIGH NUMBERS OF ESCHERICHIA COLI. CLOSTRIDIUM PERFRINGENS TYPE A WAS ONLY DETECTED IN LOW AMOUNTS IN POOLED LITTER SAMPLES. IN COMPARISON TO THE LI STUDY OOCYST SHEDDING WAS MORE INTENSE IN THE CONTROL ANIMALS IN EI, WHILE DIARRHEA WAS MORE FREQUENT IN LI. IN BOTH INFECTION MODELS A HIGH EFFICACY OF TOLTRAZURIL IN THE CONTROL OF PARASITOLOGICAL AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF EXPERIMENTAL C. SUIS INFECTION COULD BE DEMONSTRATED. SINCE IN THE LI STUDY HIGH NUMBERS OF CL. PERFRINGENS TYPE A WERE DETECTED, IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT COLONIZATION WITH THESE OPPORTUNISTIC PATHOGENS HAS SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS WITH C. SUIS AND MAY EXPLAIN VARIABLE CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN UNTREATED ANIMALS AS WELL AS THE SPORADIC OCCURRENCE OF DIARRHEA IN TOLTRAZURIL-TREATED PIGLETS. CONCLUSIONS: PARENTERAL AND ORAL TOLTRAZURIL ADMINISTERED ON THE 2ND OR 4TH DOL IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE AGAINST EXPERIMENTAL INFECTIONS WITH C. SUIS ON THE 1ST TO 3RD DOL.

ETHNOPHARMACOL.","ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT SAFE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR CHRONIC PAIN IN PETS. IN CASES SUCH AS OSTEOARTHRITIS THERE IS NO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE CURE AND VETERINARIANS USE NSAIDS TO MANAGE PAIN. PET OWNERS MAY HAVE TO PLAN FOR A LIFETIME OF PLANT-BASED TREATMENT FOR THE CONDITIONS THAT LEAD TO CHRONIC PAIN IN PETS. PHYTOPHARMACOTHERAPIES HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING LESS TOXIC, CHEAP OR FREE, READILY AVAILABLE, ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE SAFE FOR LONG-TERM USE AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO RESET THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO NORMAL FUNCTIONING. AIM OF THE STUDY: TO EXAMINE THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED MEDICINAL PLANT RESEARCH THAT MATCHES UNPUBLISHED DATA ON ETHNOVETERINARY MEDICINES (EVM) USED FOR PETS IN CANADA (BRITISH COLUMBIA) TO SEE IF THE EVM DATA CAN PROVIDE A LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NECESSARY DRUGS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN 2003 SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 60 PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE ORGANIC FARMERS OR HOLISITIC MEDICINAL/VETERINARY PRACTITIONERS OBTAINED USING A PURPOSIVE SAMPLE. A DRAFT MANUAL PREPARED FROM THE DATA WAS THEN EVALUATED BY PARTICIPANTS AT A PARTICIPATORY WORKSHOP THAT DISCUSSED THE PLANT-BASED TREATMENTS. A COPY OF THE FINAL VERSION OF THE MANUAL WAS GIVEN TO ALL RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS. IN 2018, THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH MATCHING THE EVM DATA WAS REVIEWED TO SEE IF THE EVM PRACTICES COULD SERVE AS A LEAD FOR FURTHER RESEARCH. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: MEDICINAL PLANTS ARE USED TO TREAT A RANGE OF CONDITIONS. THE INJURIES TREATED IN PETS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA INCLUDED ABSCESSES (RESULTING FROM AN INITIAL INJURY), SPRAINS AND ABRASIONS. DOGS WERE ALSO TREATED WITH MEDICINAL PLANTS FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, JOINT PAIN AND ARTICULAR CARTILAGE INJURIES. MORE THAN 40 PLANTS WERE USED. ANAL GLAND PROBLEMS WERE TREATED WITH ALLIUM SATIVUM L., ALOE VERA L., CALENDULA OFFICINALIS L., PLANTAGO MAJOR L., ULMUS FULVA MICHX., URTICA DIOICA L. AND USNEA LONGISSIMA ACH. ARCTIUM LAPPA, HYDRANGEA ARBORESCENS AND LACTUCA MURALIS WERE USED FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND JOINT PAIN IN PETS. ASTHMA WAS TREATED WITH: LINUM USITATISSIMUM L., BORAGO OFFICINALIS L., VERBASCUM THAPSUS L., CUCURBITA PEPO L., LOBELIA INFLATA L., AND ZINGIBER OFFICINALE ROSCOE. PETS WITH HEART PROBLEMS WERE TREATED WITH CRATAEGUS OXYACANTHA L., CEDRONELLA CANARIENSIS (L.) WILLD.

TRIFOLIUM PRATENSE WAS USED FOR TUMOURS IN THE PROSTATE GLAND. ALSO USED WERE ARTEMISIA ANNUA, TARAXACUM OFFICINALE AND RUMEX CRISPUS. THIS REVIEW OF PLANTS USED IN EVM WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH OF THE PLANTS DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER HAS CONTINUED BECAUSE FEW NEW PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR CHRONIC PAIN AND BECAUSE TREATMENTS LIKE GLUCOCORTICOID THERAPY DO NOT HEAL. PHYTOTHERAPUETIC PRODUCTS ARE ALSO BEING INVESTIGATED TO ADDRESS THE OVERUSE OF ANTIBIOTICS.

HERE WE PRESENT A NOVEL TECHNIQUE TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF THE PARASITE BASED ON A POOLED-MILK SAMPLE FROM 10 RANDOMLY SELECTED FIRST LACTATION HEIFERS (FLH). THIS STUDY WAS RUN IN TWO PARTS. FIRST, A LONGITUDINAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO LOOK AT INFECTION DYNAMICS IN MILK SAMPLES ACROSS THE GRAZING SEASON USING A PROTOTYPE ELISA DEVELOPED BY SVANOVA (BOEHRINGER-INGELHEIM, UPPSALA). WE IDENTIFIED THAT MEAN ODR VALUES IN MILK SAMPLES FROM FLH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT FOR OLDER COWS (0.13 VERSUS 0.07 RESPECTIVELY, P < 0.001) SUGGESTING THAT SAMPLES FROM THE FLH COHORT SHOULD BE POOLED TO PRODUCE THE TEST. SECOND, THE POOLED MILK TEST WAS EVALUATED ON A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY OF UK DAIRY HERDS (N=25 GRAZING AND N=25 ZERO-GRAZING HERDS) TO EVALUATE TEST PERFORMANCE UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS. THE OPTICAL DENSITY RATIO (ODR) CUT-OFF VALUE FOR OUR POOLED-MILK TEST USING 10 FLH MILK SAMPLES WAS OPTIMAL AT A VALUE OF 0.16. POOLING 10 FLH SAMPLES CREATED A SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF 66.7% AND 95.5% RESPECTIVELY. IN COMPARISON, WHOLE-HERD BTM SAMPLES HAD A MAXIMUM SENSITIVITY OF 37.5% AND SPECIFICITY OF 63.6% AT AN ODR CUT-OFF OF 0.18. THE AREA UNDER THE CURVE ACCORDING TO RECEIVER-OPERATIVE-CHARACTERISTIC (ROC) ANALYSIS WAS HIGH FOR THE 10-HEIFER TEST (0.87) BUT POOR FOR THE WHOLE HERD BTM TESTING (0.45). THIS STUDY PROVIDES A MORE SENSITIVE DIAGNOSTIC TEST STRATEGY FOR THE SCREENING OF D.VIVIPARUS IN DAIRY HERDS. TESTING HERDS AT THE END OF A GRAZING SEASON WOULD FACILITATE THE PLANNING OF EFFECTIVE CONTROL MEASURES, SUCH AS THE USE OF THE LUNGWORM VACCINATION OR STRATEGIC DEWORMING, FOR THE FOLLOWING GRAZING SEASON.

IN THE CASE OF JETS WITH A REYNOLDS NUMBER SMALLER THAN 104, WE FIND THAT THE PENETRATION DEPTH OF THE OSCILLATED JET CAN BE INCREASED OF UP TO 30% BY MODERATE OSCILLATION VELOCITIES. THIS INCREASE OF THE PENETRATION IS DUE TO THE DECREASE OF THE MIXING LAYER ANGLE WHEN THE SYMMETRY AROUND THE BUBBLE CLOUD IS BROKEN BY THE OSCILLATION. WE FINALLY DISCUSS THE SHAPE OF THE OVERALL REGION IMPACTED BY THE OSCILLATING BUBBLE CLOUD. WE SHOW THAT THERE IS A REGIME FOR WHICH THE PENETRATION IS MAXIMUM AT THE CENTER OF THIS REGION, AND A REGIME FOR WHICH THE PENETRATION IS MAXIMUM AT THE PERIPHERY.

PARASITOL. X","THE DIAGNOSIS, MONITORING AND FLUKICIDE EFFICACY TESTING OF FASCIOLOSIS ON-FARM IS RELIANT ON NON-TERMINAL METHODS. THE COPROANTIGEN ELISA (CELISA) HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR DIAGNOSIS OF FASCIOLOSIS AND ASSOCIATED FLUKICIDE EFFICACY TESTING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO FLUKE EGG COUNTS FOR MONITORING PARASITISM. RECENTLY EXPERIMENTAL MULTI-AGE INFECTIONS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT THE RELIABILITY OF EFFICACY RESULTS CAN BE IMPROVED BY A SECOND CELISA TESTING AT 6 WEEKS POST-TREATMENT (WPT) IN ADDITION TO THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED 1 WPT. A FIELD STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE SUITABILITY OF FAECAL FLUKE EGG COUNTS (FFEC) AND CELISA AS DIAGNOSTIC, DRUG EFFICACY TESTING AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL TOOLS ON AUSTRALIAN SHEEP AND CATTLE FARMS. FAECAL SAMPLES FROM SHEEP AND/OR CATTLE ON THREE ENDEMIC FARMS WERE TAKEN AT MONTHLY INTERVALS FOR 12 MONTHS AND EXAMINED BY BOTH METHODS. NORMAL FARM MANAGEMENT WAS MAINTAINED DURING THE STUDY PERIOD AND OPPORTUNISTIC EFFICACY TESTING, IN LINE WITH EACH FARM'S NORMAL FLUKICIDE MANAGEMENT WAS UNDERTAKEN. ADDITIONALLY, THE SUITABILITY OF THE OLLERENSHAW INDEX AS A PREDICTIVE MODEL FOR FASCIOLOSIS UNDER AUSTRALIAN CONDITIONS WAS EXAMINED. WHILE BOTH DIAGNOSTICS DEMONSTRATED THEIR VALUE IN THE FARM ENVIRONMENT, THE CURRENT DATA DEMONSTRATE A DISTINCT AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DIAGNOSTIC SENSITIVITY FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES BY USING THE TWO TESTS IN PARALLEL. THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO DIAGNOSTICS WAS FOUND TO BE HIGHER IN CATTLE, DESPITE THE POOR SENSITIVITY OF FFEC IN THIS SPECIES. SIMILAR LEVELS OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO TESTS WERE DEMONSTRATED AT BOTH SHEEP PROPERTIES, REGARDLESS OF THE MARKED DIFFERENCE IN THE INTENSITY OF F. HEPATICA CHALLENGE. LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS DEMONSTRATED THE RESULTS OF THE TWO DIAGNOSTICS UTILIZED IN PARALLEL WERE EXPLAINED SUBSTANTIALLY (R2=0.91) AS WERE SERIES DATA (R2=0.88) WHEN THE RESPECTIVE MODELS WERE FITTED. IN CONTRAST, THE FITTED MODELS FOR FFEC (R2=0.54) AND CELISA (R2=0.58) WERE POOR EXPLANATIONS FOR TEST OUTCOMES. THE OUTCOMES OF THESE MODELS SUPPORT PREVIOUS FINDINGS THAT SUGGEST THAT THE TWO DIAGNOSTIC TESTS ARE BEST UTILIZED TOGETHER, PARTICULARLY IN PARALLEL.

IN THIS WORK, WE INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH HETEROGENEITIES ON THE HYDRODYNAMIC DRAG BY STUDYING THE IDEALIZED CASE OF A RANDOM ARRANGEMENT OF SPHERES WITH A CHANNEL-LIKE VOID REGION. MORE SPECIFICALLY, WE INTRODUCE THIS HETEROGENEITY TO A HOMOGENEOUS PARTICLE ARRANGEMENT BY SHIFTING APART TWO BULK REGIONS, SUCH THAT A VOID CHANNEL DIVIDES PARTICLE BULK. SINGLE-RELAXATION-TIME LATTICE BOLTZMANN SIMULATIONS WERE PERFORMED TO RESOLVE FLUID FLOW THROUGH SUCH ARRESTED PARTICLE CONFIGURATIONS AND CALCULATE THE CORRESPONDING GAS-PARTICLE MOMENTUM EXCHANGE AND PRESSURE DROP. THE CALCULATED DRAG FORCES ACTING ON THE SOLIDS FOR RANDOM SPHERE ARRANGEMENT ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF HILL ET AL. (2001B), TENNETI ET AL. (2011), AND TANG ET AL. (2015). HOWEVER, THE OVERALL MOMENTUM EXCHANGE OBTAINED FOR CONFIGURATIONS CONTAINING A HETEROGENEITY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. OBVIOUSLY, THE CHANNEL ALLOWS FOR A BY-PASSING OF A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF THE FLOW LEADING TO A REDUCED OVERALL PRESSURE DROP AND THEREBY UNDERESTIMATING THE MINIMUM FLUIDIZATION VELOCITY IN A FLUIDIZED BED. BASED ON THESE DIRECT NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS, WE EXAMINE THE OVERALL PRESSURE DROP DEPENDENCE ON THE CHARACTERISTIC LENGTH SCALE (I.E. WIDTH) OF THE CHANNEL-LIKE HETEROGENEITY LC, THE SUPERFICIAL REYNOLDS NUMBER (30 RE 300), AND THE SOLID VOLUME FRACTION IN THE DENSE (I.E. BULK) REGION (0.4 P 0.55). THE WIDTH OF THE CHANNEL IS VARIED WITHIN THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF PARTICLE DIAMETER DP (1 LC/DP4.36), DECREASING AN OVERALL SOLID VOLUME FRACTION (0.25 0.55). IN ADDITION TO THE NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS, WE DERIVE (SEMI)-ANALYTIC CORRELATIONS FOR THE DENSE BULK REGION AS WELL AS FOR THE CHANNEL. AS THE SIMULATIONS RANGE FROM LAMINAR TO TRANSITIONAL FLOW, PROVIDING A SINGLE PRESSURE DROP CORRELATION IS VERY CHALLENGING. THEREFORE, WE ESTIMATE THE CHANNEL PRESSURE DROP WITH THE APPROPRIATE CORRELATIONS SELECTED ACCORDING TO CALCULATED SUPERFICIAL REYNOLDS NUMBER.

DATA ON ITS RISK FACTORS AND INSIGHT INTO THE ETIOLOGY ARE LIMITED. WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION OF RISK FACTORS FOR HIPPOCAMPAL CALCIFICATION IN TWO INDEPENDENT COHORTS IN THE NETHERLANDS. METHODS: UNENHANCED CT SCANS OF THE BRAIN WERE SCORED FOR THE PRESENCE AND SEVERITY OF HIPPOCAMPAL CALCIFICATION IN TWO INDEPENDENT PROSPECTIVELY COLLECTED PATIENT COHORTS, THE FIRST CONSISTING OF ANEURYSMAL SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH) PATIENTS (N=741) AND THE SECOND OF PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN THE SECOND MANIFESTATION OF ARTERIAL DISEASE (SMART) STUDY (N=498).

RESULTS: IN BOTH COHORTS, AGE 60 YEARS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF HIPPOCAMPAL CALCIFICATION (ODDS RATIO (OR) 2.47, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 1.374.45 IN SAH AND OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.302.82 IN SMART), IN SMART, AGE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MODERATE/SEVERE CALCIFICATION AS WELL (OR 2.77, 96%CI 2.77 (1.363.65).

STATINS ARE A CRUCIAL THERAPY FOR ACHIEVING LDL-C REDUCTIONS, WITH THE HIGHEST TOLERATED DOSE OFTEN PRESCRIBED, ESPECIALLY FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE AT THE GREATEST RISK OF CV DISEASE. HOWEVER, STATIN INTOLERANCE, HETEROGENEOUS RESPONSES TO STATINS AND NON-ADHERENCE MAKE ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES NECESSARY IN SOME CASES. STATINS CAN BE COMBINED WITH A MULTITUDE OF THERAPIES WITH SYNERGISTIC MECHANISMS OF ACTION TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE LIPID PROFILES, WHILE IMPROVING SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY PROFILES. ADDITION OF A CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION INHIBITOR, BILE ACID SEQUESTRANT OR FIBRATE TO STATIN THERAPY LEADS TO GREATER NUMBERS OF PATIENTS ACHIEVING AND MAINTAINING LDL-C GOALS. FURTHERMORE, COMBINATION THERAPIES CAN ALTER THE PLASMA PROFILES OF OTHER MOLECULES INVOLVED IN HYPERCHOLESTEROLAEMIA, INCLUDING TRIGLYCERIDES AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL. AN ADDITIONAL STRATEGY IS PROPROTEIN CONVERTASE SUBTILISIN/KEXIN TYPE 9 (PCSK9) INHIBITION THERAPY, FOR USE IN PATIENTS WHO ARE STATIN INTOLERANT, PATIENTS WITH HETEROZYGOUS OR HOMOZYGOUS FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLAEMIA, AND PATIENTS AT VERY HIGH CV RISK, AS A POTENTIAL MEANS FOR ACHIEVING LARGE LDL-C REDUCTIONS AND MAINTAINING LDL-C GOALS.

ENVIRON. MANAGE.","DURING THE PAST TWENTY YEARS, THE NORDIC COUNTRIES (DENMARK, SWEDEN, FINLAND AND NORWAY) HAVE INTRODUCED A RANGE OF MEASURES TO REDUCE LOSSES OF NITROGEN (N) TO AIR AND TO AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT BY LEACHING AND RUNOFF. HOWEVER, THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR IS STILL AN IMPORTANT N SOURCE TO THE ENVIRONMENT, AND PROJECTIONS INDICATE RELATIVELY SMALL EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN THE COMING YEARS. THE FOUR NORDIC COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIES REGARDING AGRICULTURAL N FLOWS AND MITIGATION MEASURES, AND THEREFORE THEY ARE FACING DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS. IN NORWAY FARM SUBSIDIES ARE USED TO ENCOURAGE MEASURES, BUT THESE ARE MAINLY FOCUSED ON PHOSPHORUS (P). IN CONTRAST, DENMARK TARGETS N AND USES CONTROL REGULATIONS TO REDUCE LOSSES. IN SWEDEN AND FINLAND, BOTH VOLUNTARY ACTIONS COMBINED WITH SUBSIDIES HELP TO MITIGATE BOTH N AND P. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE PRESENT SITUATION PERTAINING TO AGRICULTURAL N IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY INSTRUMENTS TO ACHIEVE COST EFFECTIVE ABATEMENT OF REACTIVE N FROM AGRICULTURE IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES, AND TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO OTHER COUNTRIES. TO FURTHER REDUCE N LOSSES FROM AGRICULTURE, THE FOUR COUNTRIES WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO TAKE DIFFERENT ROUTES. IN PARTICULAR, SOME COUNTRIES WILL NEED NEW ACTIONS IF 2020 AND 2030 NATIONAL EMISSIONS CEILINGS DIRECTIVE (NECD) TARGETS ARE TO BE MET. MANY OPTIONS ARE POSSIBLE, INCLUDING VOLUNTARY ACTION, REGULATION, TAXATION AND SUBSIDIES, BUT THE DIFFICULTY IS FINDING THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN THESE POLICY OPTIONS FOR EACH COUNTRY. THE GOVERNMENTS IN THE NORDIC COUNTRIES SHOULD PUT MORE ATTENTION TO THE NECD AND CONSULT WITH RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS, RESEARCHERS AND FARMER'S ASSOCIATIONS ON WHICH MEASURES TO PRIORITIZE TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS ON TIME. IT IS IMPORTANT TO PICK REMAINING LOW HANGING FRUITS THROUGH USE OF THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MITIGATION MEASURES. WE SUGGEST THAT N APPLICATION RATE AND ITS TIMING SHOULD BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CROP NEED AND CARRYING CAPACITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL RECIPIENTS. ALSO, THE CHOICE OF APPLICATION TECHNOLOGY CAN FURTHER REDUCE THE RISK OF N LOSSES INTO AIR AND WATERS. THIS MAY REQUIRE MORE REGION-SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SUPPORT WITH TAILORED INFORMATION IN COMBINATION WITH FURTHER TARGETED SUBSIDIES OR REGULATIONS. 2018 ELSEVIER LTD","AMMONIA EMISSIONS; NITROGEN MANAGEMENT; NITROGEN POLICY; NITROGEN SURPLUS; NORDIC COUNTRIES; REACTIVE NITROGEN","AMMONIA; NITROGEN; NITROUS OXIDE; PHOSPHORUS; AIR; AMMONIA; AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; EMISSION; EMISSION CONTROL; LEACHING; NITROGEN; PHOSPHORUS; POLICY APPROACH; PRIORITIZATION; RUNOFF; AGRICULTURAL LAND; AGRICULTURE; AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT; ARTICLE; BOVINE; COST EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; DENMARK; FINLAND; FRUIT; GOVERNMENT; MANURE; NITRATE LEACHING; NITROGEN DEPOSITION; NORWAY; POULTRY; SHEEP; SWEDEN; DENMARK; FINLAND; NORWAY; SWEDEN; AGRICULTURE; DENMARK; FINLAND; NORWAY; SWEDEN","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",1,"IVL SWEDISH ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, P.O.

METHODS: CONSENTING PARENTS OF CHILDREN <6 YEARS OLD ATTENDING AN OUTPATIENT CLINIC COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH CAPTURED DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION AND THEIR LEVEL OF AGREEMENT WITH BELIEF STATEMENTS ABOUT VACCINATION USING A 7-POINT LIKERT SCALE. VACCINATION STATUS WAS DETERMINED FROM THE AUSTRALIAN CHILDHOOD IMMUNISATION REGISTER AND DEEMED EITHER COMPLETE (NO DOSES OVERDUE) OR INCOMPLETE (1 OR MORE DOSES OVERDUE) AT THE TIME OF QUESTIONNAIRE COMPLETION. RESULTS: OF 589 CHILDREN OF RESPONDENTS, 116 (20%) HAD AN INCOMPLETE VACCINATION STATUS. OF THESE, NEARLY TWO-THIRDS (63%) OF PARENTS BELIEVED THAT THEIR CHILD WAS, IN FACT, FULLY-VACCINATED. COMPARED TO THOSE WITH A COMPLETE VACCINE STATUS, CHILDREN WITH AN INCOMPLETE VACCINE STATUS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE BORN OVERSEAS (P < 0.001), HAVE A LARGER FAMILY SIZE (P=0.02) AND TO HAVE PARENTS WITH LOWER EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT (P=0.001).

ONE OF THE SOCIETAL CONTEXTS IS THE INTERNET, WHERE AUDIENCES DISCUSS VACCINATION AND REFER TO SOURCES OF HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION OF VARYING QUALITY. WORKING FOR THE VWC, WE HAVE EXPLORED THE DUTCH VACCINATION DEBATE ON TWITTER IN ORDER TO: (1) IDENTIFY ONLINE COMMUNITIES IN THE VACCINATION DEBATE, (2) IDENTIFY VACCINE-RELATED NARRATIVES, AND (3) UNDERSTAND HOW THE ONLINE COMMUNITIES INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. WE IDENTIFIED SEVEN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING (PUBLIC) HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, WRITERS AND JOURNALISTS, ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT, AND INTERNATIONAL VACCINATION ADVOCATES. THE DEBATE IS SPEARHEADED BY THE WRITERS & JOURNALISTS COMMUNITY, WHILE THE HEALTH- AND ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT COMMUNITIES TRY TO INFLUENCE IT. THE HEALTH COMMUNITY CIRCULATES FACTS, FIGURES AND SCIENTIFIC STUDIES, WHILE NEGATIVE MESSAGES ABOUT VACCINATION EITHER FROM A HOMEOPATHY OR CONSPIRACY PERSPECTIVE ARE MOST PREVALENT IN THE ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT.

MOST OF THESE NETWORKS USE SUBJECT SELF-REPORTS TO DEFINE INFLUENZA VACCINATION HISTORY. IN THIS STUDY, WE USED SIMULATIONS TO ESTIMATE THE DEGREE TO WHICH SELF-REPORTED VACCINATION STATUS CAN BIAS TEST-NEGATIVE VE ESTIMATES. METHODS: WE SIMULATED A POPULATION WHOSE MEMBERS ARE AT RISK FOR ACUTE RESPIRATORY ILLNESS (ARI) DUE TO INFLUENZA AND FOR ARI DUE TO OTHER RESPIRATORY PATHOGENS. VACCINATION WAS ASSUMED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF INFLUENZA BUT NOT OF NON-INFLUENZA ARI. WE SIMULATED A RANGE OF POSSIBLE VALUES FOR VE AND FOR VACCINE COVERAGE. ACROSS SIMULATIONS, WE VARIED THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY OF SELF-REPORTED VACCINATION STATUS RELATIVE TO TRUE VACCINATION. WE ESTIMATED BIAS AS THE PERCENT DIFFERENCE IN VE IN THE PRESENCE OF MISCLASSIFICATION RELATIVE TO TRUE SIMULATED VE. RESULTS: ASSUMING SELF-REPORT HAS SENSITIVITY OF 95% AND SPECIFICITY OF 90%, ESTIMATED VE UNDERESTIMATED TRUE VE BY 16% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 430%). DECREASING SPECIFICITY OF SELF-REPORTS RESULTED IN GREATER BIAS THAN DECREASING SENSITIVITY OF SELF-REPORTS. BIAS ALSO INCREASED AS VACCINE COVERAGE DECREASED. CONCLUSIONS: THE USE OF SELF-REPORTED INFLUENZA VACCINATION HISTORY CAN MEANINGFULLY BIAS INFLUENZA VE IN TEST-NEGATIVE STUDIES.

HOWEVER, CURRENT IN VIVO TUMORIGENICITY ASSAYS CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING AND RESULTS CAN BE EQUIVOCAL, ESPECIALLY FOR WEAKLY TUMORIGENIC CELLS. BASEMENT MEMBRANE EXTRACT (BME) DERIVED FROM THE ENGELBRETH-HOLM-SWARM MOUSE TUMOR, SUCH AS MATRIGEL AND CULTREX, CONSISTS OF LAMININ, COLLAGEN IV, ENTACTIN, HEPARAN SULFATE, AND PROTEOGLYCANS, AS WELL AS BIOLOGICALLY ACTIVE PEPTIDES AND GROWTH FACTORS. FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES, BME HAS BEEN USED IN CANCER RESEARCH TO ENHANCE TUMORIGENICITY ASSAYS (BOTH TUMOR TAKE AS WELL AS TUMOR GROWTH ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED). WE ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY OF USING BME TO FACILITATE THE EVALUATION OF VACCINE CELL SUBSTRATE TUMORIGENICITY. VERO CELLS (WHO 10-87) WERE SERIALLY PASSAGED AND BANKED AT EVERY TEN PASSAGES BEGINNING WITH P140, FOR THE PRESENT STUDY, LOW-PASSAGE VERO CELLS (VERO LP, ORIGINATING FROM CELLS BANKED AT P140) AND HIGH-PASSAGE VERO CELLS (VERO HP, ORIGINATING FROM CELLS BANKED AT P250) WERE USED. IN ADDITION, VERO TPX2 AND VERO NM1, CELL LINES ESTABLISHED FROM TUMORS FORMED IN NUDE MICE BY VERO HP CELLS, AS WELL AS OTHER CELL LINES RELEVANT TO VACCINE PRODUCTION (HELA, MDCK, 293, AND ARPE-19), WERE ASSESSED. FEMALE ADULT ATHYMIC NUDE MICE WERE INJECTED SUBCUTANEOUSLY WITH CELLS IN THE ABSENCE OR PRESENCE OF BME. WE OBSERVED THAT THE TUMORIGENICITY OF ARPE-19 CELLS AS WELL AS VERO CELLS BELOW PASSAGE 258 (VERO LP AND VERO HP, PREVIOUSLY CHARACTERIZED AS NON-TUMORIGENIC OR WEAKLY TUMORIGENIC, RESPECTIVELY) WAS NOT ENHANCED BY BME. IN CONTRAST, BME SHORTENED THE LATENCY AND DECREASED THE TUMOR-PRODUCING CELL DOSE OF HELA, 293, AND MDCK CELLS AS WELL AS THE TUMORIGENIC VERO DERIVATIVES TPX2 AND NM1. THUS, RESPONSIVENESS TO BME MAY REFLECT THE STATUS OF THE NEOPLASTIC PROCESS AND POSSIBLY SERVE AS A USEFUL TRAIT FOR BETTER DEFINING THE TUMORIGENIC PHENOTYPE OF CELLS. 2019","BASEMENT MEMBRANE; MATRIGEL; NUDE MOUSE; TUMOR; TUMORIGENICITY; VERO","MATRIGEL; ADULT; ANIMAL CELL; ANIMAL EXPERIMENT; ANIMAL MODEL; ANIMAL TISSUE; ARPE-19 CELL LINE; ARTICLE; BASEMENT MEMBRANE; CANCER INCIDENCE; CARCINOGENICITY; CELL CULTURE; CONTROLLED STUDY; FEASIBILITY STUDY; FEMALE; HELA CELL LINE; HISTOPATHOLOGY; HUMAN; HUMAN CELL; IMMUNE RESPONSE; MDCK CELL LINE; MOUSE; NONHUMAN; PRIORITY JOURNAL; VERO CELL LINE","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"LABORATORY OF DNA VIRUSES, DIVISION OF VIRAL PRODUCTS, OFFICE OF VACCINES RESEARCH AND REVIEW, CENTER FOR BIOLOGICS EVALUATION AND RESEARCH, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, SILVER SPRING, MD, UNITED STATES; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, ROCKVILLE, MD, UNITED STATES","10.1016/J.JVACX.2019.100004","100004","MURATA, H., FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, 10903 NEW HAMPSHIRE AVENUE, BUILDING 52/72, ROOM 1206, UNITED STATES, EMAIL: HARUHIKO.MURATAFDA.HHS.GOV",NA,NA,"25901362",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","1",2019,"none","CENTER FOR BIOLOGICS EVALUATION AND RESEARCH;NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES","NOTREPORTED",NA,"MURATA H, 2019, VACCINE X","MURATA H, 2019, VACCINE X"

WE ESTIMATED VACCINE EFFECTIVENESS (VE) IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE PROGRAMME. METHODS: WE USED A TEST-NEGATIVE CASE-CONTROL DESIGN AND ENHANCED NATIONAL SURVEILLANCE DATA FOR 1869 VACCINE-ELIGIBLE CHILDREN TESTED FOR ROTAVIRUS INFECTION TO OBTAIN ADJUSTED ODDS RATIOS AND VE AGAINST LABORATORY-CONFIRMED ROTAVIRUS INFECTIONS. LINKED ANONYMISED UK PRIMARY CARE AND HOSPITALISATION DATA FROM THE CLINICAL PRACTICE RESEARCH DATALINK (40,723 CHILDREN) AND RANDOM-EFFECTS POISSON REGRESSION WERE USED IN A COHORT STUDY TO ESTIMATE VE AGAINST ALL-CAUSE ACUTE GASTROENTERITIS (AGE) AND AGE HOSPITALISATIONS. RESULTS: VE AGAINST LABORATORY-CONFIRMED INFECTION WAS 69% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 4084%) FOR ONE DOSE AND 77% (95%CI: 6685%) FOR TWO DOSES. TWO-DOSE VE IN CHILDREN AGED <12 MONTHS AND 12 MONTHS WAS 85% (95%CI: 7491%) AND 54% (95%CI: 1575%), RESPECTIVELY. IN CONTRAST, WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT THE VACCINE WAS EFFECTIVE AGAINST ALL-CAUSE AGE (VE=20%, 95%CI: 36% TO 5%), OR AGAINST AGE HOSPITALISATIONS (VE=35%, 95% CI: 86% TO 77%). CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS FIRST DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF VE OF THE ROTARIX VACCINE IN THE ENGLISH NATIONAL PROGRAMME, WE SHOW THAT ROTARIX WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING LABORATORY-CONFIRMED ROTAVIRUS INFECTION IN YOUNG CHILDREN. THIS PROVIDES REASSURANCE ABOUT THE VACCINE'S PERFORMANCE IN REAL-LIFE SETTINGS AND GIVES KEY INFORMATION FOR FUTURE COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSES. THE HIGH VE AGAINST ROTAVIRUS-SPECIFIC AGE, AND THE EXCEPTIONALLY SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATIONAL ROTAVIRUS VACCINE PROGRAMME (WITH >90% VACCINE COVERAGE), EXPLAINS THE LACK OF VE AGAINST ALL-CAUSE AGE BECAUSE MOST AGE IN THE POST-VACCINE ERA WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DUE TO ROTAVIRUS, ALTHOUGH SOME UNDERESTIMATION OF VE COULD ALSO HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO DIFFERENTIAL HEALTHCARE UTILISATION BY VACCINATED AND UNVACCINATED INFANTS.

TO PROTECT NEWBORNS FROM THIS SERIOUS DISEASE, EKIF, THE SWISS NATIONAL IMMUNIZATION TECHNICAL ADVISORY GROUP, HAS RECOMMENDED VACCINATION AGAINST PERTUSSIS DURING PREGNANCY (2ND OR 3RD TRIMESTER) SINCE 2013. ALSO, SINCE 2009, EKIF HAS RECOMMENDED VACCINATION AGAINST INFLUENZA DURING PREGNANCY. WE CONDUCTED THIS STUDY TO ASSESS ACCEPTANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE RECENTLY INTRODUCED RECOMMENDATIONS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED STANDARDIZED INTERVIEWS WITH PARENTS OF CHILDREN BORN ON OR AFTER 01.01.2013, HOSPITALIZED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BASEL CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, SWITZERLAND, BETWEEN JANUARY AND JUNE 2017. IF PARTICIPATION WAS DECLINED, PARTIAL CONSENT WAS SOUGHT FOR FOUR QUESTIONS REGARDING AGE, EDUCATION LEVEL, ATTITUDES TOWARDS VACCINATIONS IN GENERAL AND AVAILABILITY OF VACCINATION RECORDS. RESULTS: IN 193 OF 398 ELIGIBLE CHILDREN THE MOTHER PARTICIPATED. FIVE (3%) OF 172 MOTHERS HAD RECEIVED BOTH PERTUSSIS AND INFLUENZA VACCINES DURING PREGNANCY, 15 (9%) ONLY AGAINST PERTUSSIS AND 12 (7%) ONLY AGAINST INFLUENZA. VERY FEW MOTHERS HAD RECEIVED VACCINATION RECOMMENDATION DURING PREGNANCY: 17 (10%) FOR BOTH PERTUSSIS AND INFLUENZA AND 15 (9%) EACH FOR PERTUSSIS AND INFLUENZA ONLY. MAIN REASONS FOR REFUSAL OF VACCINATION DESPITE RECOMMENDATION WERE THAT THEY WERE NOT DEEMED USEFUL (59% FOR INFLUENZA AND 37% FOR PERTUSSIS) AND SAFETY CONCERNS FOR THE CHILD (18% FOR INFLUENZA AND 26% FOR PERTUSSIS). CONCLUSIONS: RECOMMENDATION FOR AND IMMUNIZATION RATES AGAINST PERTUSSIS AND INFLUENZA DURING PREGNANCY ARE LOW AND NEED TO BE IMPROVED.

DUE TO THE ENGINEERING CAPACITY OF THE BACTERIAL CORE, THE HYBRID VECTOR PROVIDES UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMMUNOGENICITY OPTIMIZATION THROUGH VARYING CELLULAR LOCALIZATION (CYTOPLASM, PERIPLASM, CELLULAR SURFACE) AND TYPE (PROTEIN OR DNA) OF ANTIGEN. IN THIS WORK, THREE PROTEIN-BASED HYBRID VECTOR FORMATS WERE COMPARED IN WHICH THE PNEUMOCOCCAL SURFACE PROTEIN A (PSPA) WAS LOCALIZED TO THE CYTOPLASM, SURFACE, AND PERIPLASMIC SPACE OF THE BACTERIAL CORE FOR VACCINATION AGAINST PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE. FURTHERMORE, WE TESTED THE HYBRID VECTOR'S CAPACITY AS A DNA VACCINE AGAINST STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE BY INTRODUCING A PLASMID INTO THE BACTERIAL CORE TO FACILITATE PSPA EXPRESSION IN ANTIGEN PRESENTING CELLS (APCS). THROUGH TESTING THESE VARIOUS FORMULATIONS, WE DETERMINED THAT CYTOPLASMIC ACCUMULATION OF PSPA ELICITED THE STRONGEST IMMUNE RESPONSE (ANTIBODY PRODUCTION AND PROTECTION AGAINST BACTERIAL CHALLENGE) AND ENABLED COMPLETE PROTECTION AT SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER DOSES WHEN COMPARED TO VACCINATION WITH PSPA + ADJUVANT. WE ALSO IMPROVED THE STORAGE STABILITY OF THE HYBRID VECTOR TO RETAIN COMPLETE ACTIVITY AFTER 1 MONTH AT 4 C USING AN APPROACH IN WHICH HYBRID VECTORS SUSPENDED IN A MICROBIAL FREEZE DRYING BUFFER WERE DESICCATED.

INFLUENZA A(H1N1)PDM09 COCIRCULATED WITH B/YAMAGATA AND B/VICTORIA DURING THE STUDY PERIOD IN JAPAN. METHOD: WE BASED OUR CASE DEFINITION ON TWO LABORATORY TESTS, REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT PCR), AND VIRUS ISOLATION AND COMPARED VES BASED ON THESE TESTS. IN ADDITION, VE WAS EVALUATED BY RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TEST (RDT). NASOPHARYNGEAL SWABS WERE COLLECTED FROM OUTPATIENTS WHO VISITED CLINICS WITH INFLUENZA-LIKE ILLNESS (ILIS) IN HOKKAIDO, NIIGATA, GUNMA AND NAGASAKI PREFECTURES. RESULTS: AMONG 713 CHILDREN AND ADULTS ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY, 578 WERE INFLUENZA POSITIVE BY RT PCR INCLUDING, 392 INFLUENZA A AND 186 INFLUENZA B, WHILE 135 WERE TESTED NEGATIVE CONTROLS. THE ADJUSTED VE BY RT PCR FOR ALL AGES AGAINST ANY INFLUENZA WAS LOW PROTECTION OF 36.0% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 3.1% TO 58.6%), FOR INFLUENZA A WAS 30.0% (95% CI: 10.0% TO 55.5%), AND INFLUENZA B WAS MODERATE 50.2% (95% CI: 13.3% TO 71.4%).

THERE IS NO VACCINE TO PROTECT AGAINST THESE HIGHLY-PATHOGENIC AND INTRINSICALLY ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT BACTERIA, AND THERE IS CONCERN REGARDING THEIR USE AS BIOLOGICAL WARFARE AGENTS. FOR THESE REASONS, B. MALLEI AND B. PSEUDOMALLEI ARE CLASSIFIED AS TIER 1 ORGANISMS BY THE U.S. FEDERAL SELECT AGENT PROGRAM AND THE AVAILABILITY OF EFFECTIVE COUNTERMEASURES REPRESENTS A CRITICAL UNMET NEED. METHODS: VACCINES (SUBUNIT AND VECTORED) CONTAINING THE SURFACE-EXPOSED PASSENGER DOMAIN OF THE CONSERVED BURKHOLDERIA AUTOTRANSPORTER PROTEIN BATA WERE ADMINISTERED TO BALB/C MICE AND THE VACCINATED ANIMALS WERE CHALLENGED WITH LETHAL DOSES OF WILD-TYPE B.

MICE WERE MONITORED FOR SIGNS OF ILLNESS FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO 40 DAYS POST-CHALLENGE AND TISSUES FROM SURVIVING ANIMALS WERE ANALYZED FOR BACTERIAL BURDEN AT STUDY END-POINTS. RESULTS: A SINGLE DOSE OF RECOMBINANT PARAINFLUENZA VIRUS 5 (PIV5) EXPRESSING BATA PROVIDED 74% AND 60% SURVIVAL IN MICE INFECTED WITH B. MALLEI AND B. PSEUDOMALLEI, RESPECTIVELY. VACCINATION WITH PIV5-BATA ALSO RESULTED IN COMPLETE BACTERIAL CLEARANCE FROM THE LUNGS AND SPLEEN OF 78% AND 44% OF ANIMALS SURVIVING LETHAL CHALLENGE WITH B. PSEUDOMALLEI, RESPECTIVELY.

A RECENT PUBLICATION BY THE V3SWG DESCRIBED LIVE, ATTENUATED, RECOMBINANT VESICULAR STOMATITIS VIRUS (RVSV) AS A CHIMERIC VIRUS VACCINE FOR HIV-1 (CLARKE ET AL., 2016). THE RVSV VECTOR SYSTEM IS BEING EXPLORED AS A PLATFORM FOR DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIPLE VACCINES. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE MOLECULAR AND BIOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THE RVSV VECTOR SYSTEM, FOLLOWED BY A TEMPLATE WITH DETAILS ON THE SAFETY AND CHARACTERISTICS OF A RVSV VACCINE AGAINST ZAIRE EBOLAVIRUS (ZEBOV). THE RVSV-ZEBOV VACCINE IS A LIVE, REPLICATION COMPETENT VECTOR IN WHICH THE VSV GLYCOPROTEIN (G) GENE IS REPLACED WITH THE GLYCOPROTEIN (GP) GENE OF ZEBOV. MULTIPLE COPIES OF GP ARE EXPRESSED AND ASSEMBLED INTO THE VIRAL ENVELOPE RESPONSIBLE FOR INDUCING PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY. THE VACCINE (DESIGNATED V920) WAS ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED BY THE NATIONAL MICROBIOLOGY LABORATORY, PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCY OF CANADA, FURTHER DEVELOPED BY NEWLINK GENETICS CORP. AND MERCK & CO., AND IS NOW IN FINAL STAGES OF REGISTRATION BY MERCK. THE VACCINE IS ATTENUATED BY DELETION OF THE PRINCIPAL VIRULENCE FACTOR OF VSV (THE G PROTEIN), WHICH ALSO REMOVES THE PRIMARY TARGET FOR ANTI-VECTOR IMMUNITY. THE V920 VACCINE CAUSED NO TOXICITIES AFTER INTRAMUSCULAR (IM) OR INTRACRANIAL INJECTION OF NONHUMAN PRIMATES AND NO REPRODUCTIVE OR DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY IN A RAT MODEL. IN MULTIPLE STUDIES, CYNOMOLGUS MACAQUES IMMUNIZED IM WITH A WIDE RANGE OF VIRUS DOSES RAPIDLY DEVELOPED ZEBOV-SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES MEASURED IN IGG ELISA AND NEUTRALIZATION ASSAYS AND WERE FULLY PROTECTED AGAINST LETHAL CHALLENGE WITH ZEBOV VIRUS. OVER 20,000 PEOPLE HAVE RECEIVED THE VACCINE IN CLINICAL TRIALS, THE VACCINE HAS PROVEN TO BE SAFE AND WELL TOLERATED. DURING THE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER VACCINATION, MANY VACCINEES EXPERIENCE A MILD ACUTE-PHASE REACTION WITH FEVER, HEADACHE, MYALGIA, AND ARTHRALGIA OF SHORT DURATION, THIS PERIOD IS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW-LEVEL VIREMIA, ACTIVATION OF ANTI-VIRAL GENES, AND INCREASED LEVELS OF CHEMOKINES AND CYTOKINES. OLIGOARTHRITIS AND RASH APPEARING IN THE SECOND WEEK OCCUR AT A LOW INCIDENCE, AND ARE TYPICALLY MILD-MODERATE IN SEVERITY AND SELF-LIMITED.

WE PRESENT THE CASE OF A 58-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH A 5-DAY HISTORY OF DIZZINESS. A COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY ANGIOGRAPHY REVEALED A 15-MM-DIAMETER ANEURYSM IN THE LEFT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERY AND A 6-MM-DIAMETER ANEURYSM IN THE ANTERIOR COMMUNICATING ARTERY. CHARACTERIZATION OF BOTH LESIONS WAS OBTAINED WITH A CEREBRAL ANGIOGRAM. GIVEN THE WIDE NATURE OF THE BASE OF THE MCA LESION, A SURGICAL OBLITERATION WAS CONSIDERED BEST. A LEFT FRONTOTEMPORAL CRANIOTOMY WITH THE PATIENT UNDER TOTAL INTRAVENOUS ANESTHESIA AND CONTINUOUS NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MONITORING WAS PERFORMED TO APPROACH BOTH INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS. ACCESS THROUGH THE SYLVIAN FISSURE CORRIDOR WAS OBTAINED, AND THE DOME OF THE MCA LESION WAS QUICKLY IDENTIFIED. THE LARGE ANEURYSM NECK CHALLENGED VISUALIZATION OF THE TAKEOFF VESSELS OF THE MCA DIVISIONS, AND AFTER CAREFUL DISSECTION, VISUALIZATION REMAINED POOR, THEREFORE, A SUCTION DECOMPRESSION TECHNIQUE WAS CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE TO GAIN ANATOMICAL CONTROL. 1,2 FOR DOING SO, WE USED A 21-GAUGE NEEDLE WIRED TO A 3-MM RETRACTOR ON THE GREENBERG SYSTEM, CONNECTED DISTALLY TO SUCTION. AFTER CORNERING THE LESION WITH TEMPORARY ANEURYSM CLIPS, NEEDLE INSERTION WAS PERFORMED, ENABLING ANEURYSMAL COLLAPSE AND PERFECT VISUALIZATION OF THE TAKE-OFF VESSELS, WHICH ALLOWED PROPER CLIP DEPLOYMENT ACROSS THE LESION.

ONE SUCH PROBLEM IS IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (NFRS) IN REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENTS. ML-BASED APPROACHES TO THIS PROBLEM HAVE SHOWN TO PRODUCE PROMISING RESULTS, BETTER THAN THOSE PRODUCED BY TRADITIONAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) APPROACHES. YET, A SYSTEMATIC UNDERSTANDING OF THESE ML APPROACHES IS STILL LACKING. METHOD: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF 24 ML-BASED APPROACHES FOR IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING NFRS. DIRECTED BY THREE RESEARCH QUESTIONS, THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ML ALGORITHMS ARE USED IN THESE APPROACHES, HOW THESE ALGORITHMS WORK AND HOW THEY ARE EVALUATED. RESULTS: (1) 16 DIFFERENT ML ALGORITHMS ARE FOUND IN THESE APPROACHES, OF WHICH SUPERVISED LEARNING ALGORITHMS ARE MOST POPULAR. (2) ALL 24 APPROACHES HAVE FOLLOWED A STANDARD PROCESS IN IDENTIFYING AND CLASSIFYING NFRS. (3) PRECISION AND RECALL ARE THE MOST USED MATRICES TO MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE APPROACHES. FINDING: THE REVIEW FINDS THAT WHILE ML-BASED APPROACHES HAVE THE POTENTIAL IN THE CLASSIFICATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF NFRS, THEY FACE SOME OPEN CHALLENGES THAT WILL AFFECT THEIR PERFORMANCE AND PRACTICAL APPLICATION. IMPACT: THE REVIEW CALLS FOR THE CLOSE COLLABORATION BETWEEN RE AND ML RESEARCHERS, TO ADDRESS OPEN CHALLENGES FACING THE DEVELOPMENT OF REAL-WORLD ML SYSTEMS. SIGNIFICANCE: THE USE OF ML IN RE OPENS UP EXCITING OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP NOVEL EXPERT AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT RE TASKS AND PROCESSES.

THIS PAPER SETS OUT TO PROVIDE AN AUSTRALIAN PERSPECTIVE ON DAM COSTS AND DAM COST OVERRUNS, EXAMINE PATTERNS OF DAM COSTS AND COST OVERRUNS, AND DEVELOP A GOOD PREDICTOR OF COSTS AND COST OVERRUNS FOR THE AUSTRALIAN SITUATION. SEVERAL COST METRICS, DAM COSTS AND RELATED DATA, WERE COLLATED FOR 98 DAMS CONSTRUCTED ACROSS AUSTRALIA SINCE 1888. DAM COSTS, OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) COSTS, AND CONSTRUCTION OVERRUN COSTS WERE RELATED TO INDEPENDENT VARIABLES INCLUDING DAM SITE TERRAIN CHARACTERISTICS AND CATCHMENT AND CLIMATE ATTRIBUTES. EACH METRIC WAS RELATED THROUGH MULTIPLE REGRESSION TO MAINLY PHYSICAL AND CLIMATE ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAM. MULTIPLE CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS ACCOUNT FOR BETWEEN 50% AND 80% OF THE VARIANCE IN THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE. THE EXCEEDANCE RANGE (DEFINED AS 75% EXCEEDANCE TO 25% EXCEEDANCE) OF FINAL DAM COSTS (2016 AUD) (98 DAMS) IS FROM $393 PER ML OF RESERVOIR STORAGE TO $2040 PER ML. ANNUAL O&M COSTS (33 DAMS), EXPRESSED AS A % OF FINAL DAM COST, VARIES FROM 0.14% TO 0.35%, THOUGH THESE O&M COSTS DO NOT INCLUDE MAJOR UPGRADES. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY OF AUSTRALIAN DAMS ARE IN KEEPING WITH INTERNATIONAL STUDIES THAT HAVE FOUND THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ARE SYSTEMATICALLY BIASED DOWNWARDS. IN THIS STUDY THE MEDIAN AND MEAN COST OVERRUNS (40 DAMS), EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE DAM COST ESTIMATED IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION, ARE 49% AND 120% RESPECTIVELY WITH THE SMALLEST AND LARGEST COST OVERRUN VALUES BEING 48% AND 825% RESPECTIVELY. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE DATA DAM COST OVERRUNS APPEAR TO BE MORE PREVALENT IN SEDIMENTARY ROCK THAN HARD ROCK (E.G. IGNEOUS AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS) SETTINGS. THE STRONG LIKELIHOOD OF DAM COST OVERRUNS OCCURRING HAS IMPLICATIONS TO FORECASTED BENEFIT-COST RATIOS, AND SUPPORTS ASSERTIONS THAT LARGE DAM COST AND CONTINGENCY ESTIMATES SHOULD BE CHECKED AT PRE-FEASIBILITY AND FEASIBILITY STAGES BY AN INDEPENDENT ORGANISATION AND BY PERSONS HIGHLY EXPERIENCED IN DAM DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND COSTING. 2019","ANCOLD; MULTIPLE REGRESSION; OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE COST; RESERVOIR YIELD; WATER RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; WATER SUPPLY","CATCHMENTS; COST ESTIMATING; DAMS; DIGITAL STORAGE; IGNEOUS ROCKS; METAMORPHIC ROCKS; RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT; RESERVOIRS (WATER); SEDIMENTARY ROCKS; WATER MANAGEMENT; WATER SUPPLY; ANCOLD; INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT; INTERNATIONAL STUDIES; MULTIPLE CORRELATION COEFFICIENTS; MULTIPLE REGRESSIONS; OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE; TERRAIN CHARACTERISTICS; WATERRESOURCE MANAGEMENT; COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS; CATCHMENT; COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS; DAM; HARD ROCK; MULTIPLE REGRESSION; RESERVOIR; RESOURCE MANAGEMENT; SEDIMENTARY ROCK; WATER RESOURCE; WATER SUPPLY; AUSTRALIA","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"CSIRO, GPO BOX 1700, CANBERRA, ACT 2601, AUSTRALIA; DEPARTMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING, SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNEVICTORIA 3010, AUSTRALIA","10.1016/J.HYDROA.2019.100026","100026","PETHERAM, C., CSIRO, GPO BOX 1700, AUSTRALIA, EMAIL: CUAN.PETHERAMCSIRO.AU",NA,NA,"25899155",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","3",2019,"none","","NOTREPORTED",NA,"PETHERAM C, 2019, JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X","PETHERAM C, 2019, JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X"

THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN ENABLED ANALYSIS OF POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE FACTORS. FIRST OUTFLOW AND EVENT-BASED SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED. OUTFLOW CONCENTRATIONS WERE INDEPENDENT OF INFLOW CONCENTRATIONS AND HENCE CONTROLLED BY INTERNAL PROCESSES. OVERALL TSS REMOVAL WAS HIGH BUT SENSITIVE TO BACTERIAL SYNTHESIS. EVENT-BASED SAMPLES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BACTERIA CONCENTRATIONS THAN FIRST OUTFLOW SAMPLES, SUGGESTING THAT REMAINING/SURVIVING BACTERIA IN THE BIORETENTION CELLS HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON INITIAL PEAK OUTFLOW CONCENTRATIONS. THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE VARIED BETWEEN BACTERIAL SPECIES AND SAMPLE TYPES. LONG DRY PERIODS SEEMED BENEFICIAL FOR BACTERIA REDUCTION, BUT OUTFLOW BACTERIA CONCENTRATIONS PEAKED DURING THE SECOND WATERING AFTER LONG DRY PERIODS. SUBMERGED ZONES SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BACTERIA OUTFLOW CONCENTRATIONS.

X","BACKGROUND: PETROCLIVAL TUMORS ARE FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES FOR SKULL BASE SURGEONS. OBTAINING ADEQUATE SURGICAL ACCESS IS A PARAMOUNT CONSIDERATION. ALTHOUGH THE COMBINED TRANSPETROSAL APPROACH PROVIDES A WIDE SURGICAL CORRIDOR, IT IS TECHNICALLY CHALLENGING AND, TO A DEGREE, MORBID. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE TRANSPETROSAL-RIDGE APPROACH, WHICH IS A MODIFICATION OF THE COMBINED TRANSPETROSAL APPROACH WITH IMPROVEMENTS WITH REGARDS TO EASE OF EXECUTION AND REDUCED SURGICAL MORBIDITY. METHODS: THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE TRANSPETROSAL-RIDGE APPROACH ARE OUTLINED, FOLLOWED BY A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE STEPS. THE HEAD IS PLACED IN THE LATERAL POSITION. AFTER SKIN INCISION AND MUSCLE ELEVATION, A TEMPORO-SUBOCCIPITAL CRANIOTOMY IS PERFORMED. MIDDLE FOSSA DURA IS ELEVATED TO THE PETROUS RIDGE. A LIMITED MASTOIDECTOMY IS PERFORMED WITH PRESERVATION OF THE SEMICIRCULAR CANALS. THE REMAINING PETROUS RIDGE IS THEN RESECTED AND THE POSTERIOR FOSSA DURA IS OPENED, WITH THE OPENING EXTENDING THROUGH THE TRIGEMINAL DURAL RING. RESULTS: STEPS OF THE COMBINED TRANSPETROSAL APPROACH THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE FINAL SURGICAL CORRIDOR ARE OMITTED. EXTENSIVE MASTOID AND PETROUS APEX RESECTION IS AVOIDED. POSTERIOR FOSSA DURAL OPENING EXTENDING THROUGH THE TRIGEMINAL DURAL RING IS A CRITICAL STEP, AS IT DETACHES THE SUPERIOR PETROSAL SINUS AND SIGMOID SINUS FROM THE PETROUS BONE. WITH THE RETRACTION OF THE TEMPORAL LOBE AND THE CEREBELLUM AND SIGMOID SINUS, A WIDE SURGICAL CORRIDOR IS OBTAINED. CONCLUSIONS: THE TRANSPETROSAL-RIDGE APPROACH IS A MODIFICATION OF THE COMBINED TRANSPETROSAL APPROACH WITH OPTIMIZATION OF THE OPERATIVE STEPS WHILE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE A WIDE SURGICAL CORRIDOR TO THE PETROCLIVAL REGION. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S)","COMBINED TRANSPETROSAL APPROACH; SKULL BASE SURGERY","ARTICLE; CEREBELLUM; CRANIOTOMY; HEAD POSITION; HUMAN; MASTOIDECTOMY; NEUROSURGERY; PETROUS BONE; POSTERIOR FOSSA; SEMICIRCULAR CANAL; SIGMOID SINUS; SKIN INCISION; SUPERIOR PETROSAL SINUS; SURGICAL APPROACH; TEMPORAL LOBE; TRANSPETROSAL RIDGE APPROACH","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY, NATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTE, SINGAPORE","10.1016/J.WNSX.2019.100009","100009","TAN, E.T.W., DEPARTMENT OF NEUROSURGERY, NATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTESINGAPORE, EMAIL: EDDIE.TAN.T.WICLOUD.COM",NA,NA,"25901397",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER INC.",NA,"SCOPUS","2",2019,"none","NATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTE","NATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTESINGAPORE",NA,"TAN ETW, 2019, WORLD NEUROSURG X","TAN ETW, 2019, WORLD NEUROSURG X"

WE RETROSPECTIVELY ANALYZED SURGICAL RESULTS AND THE IMPACT OF SEQUENTIAL ALTERATION OF POSTERIOR FOSSA (PF) SIZE IN PATIENTS WITH CHIARI MALFORMATION TYPE 1 AFTER DURAPLASTY USING LOCAL FASCIA. METHODS: THE PATIENTS WITH CHIARI MALFORMATION TYPE 1 WHO UNDERWENT FMD WITH DURAPLASTY USING LOCAL FASCIA AT OUR INSTITUTION BETWEEN 2004 AND 2015 WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. SOME PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT FMD WITHOUT DURAPLASTY AND PATIENTS WITH INSUFFICIENT FOLLOW-UP DATA WERE EXCLUDED. IMPROVEMENT OF CLINICAL SIGNS, REGRESSION OF SYRINX, AND TEMPORAL ALTERATION OF PF SIZE WERE ANALYZED WITH PERIOPERATIVE MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. POSTOPERATIVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED AT THE FINAL FOLLOW-UP USING THE CHICAGO CHIARI OUTCOME SCALE.

THE HYPOTHESIS WAS CONFIRMED THROUGH LABORATORY-BATCH STUDIES EXAMINING TETRACHLOROETHENE (PCE) SORPTION ON RIVERBED SEDIMENT SAMPLES FROM THE HIGHLY URBANISED RIVER TAME HEADWATERS CATCHMENT (BIRMINGHAM, UK) AND THE RIVER TERN (SHROPSHIRE) PROVIDING A NEARBY RURAL BENCHMARK. URBAN-RIVERBED SORPTION WAS ELEVATED WITH OBSERVED ORGANIC-CARBON PARTITION COEFFICIENT (KOC) VALUES OVER AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE GREATER THAN RURAL VALUES. THE LATTER COMPARE TO THE WIDELY USED US EPA GEOMETRIC-MEAN KOC AND ATTRIBUTED TO ABSORPTION-DOMINATED PARTITIONING INTO (RECENT) NATURAL ORGANIC MATTER. USE OF THAT MEAN IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR THE URBAN RIVERBED, POTENTIALLY UNDERESTIMATING RETARDATION BY AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. ORGANIC PETROGRAPHY CONFIRMED THE URBAN RIVERBED CONTAINED A HIGH PROPORTION OF TACM-RICH ORGANIC-MATTER PARTICLES TO WHICH SIGNIFICANT ADSORPTION MIGHT BE EXPECTED, FURTHERMORE, ELEVATED URBAN KOC VALUES WERE CONSISTENT WITH TACM-RICH SEDIMENT LITERATURE ESTIMATES.

CONSEQUENCES OF THE INCREASED URBAN RIVERBED RESIDENCE TIME ON ATTENUATION AND BIOAVAILABILITY ASSUMPTION SENSITIVITIES WERE MODELLED. UNDER THE STANDARD ASSUMPTION OF SORBED CONTAMINANT BEING NON-BIOAVAILABLE, RAPID RATES OF AQUEOUS-PHASE BIODEGRADATION ARE NECESSARY FOR COMPLETE ATTENUATION WITHIN A RIVERBED. CONVERSELY, IF ADSORBED CONTAMINANT IS BIOAVAILABLE, THEN COMPLETE ATTENUATION IS PROBABLE WHERE HIGHLY ADSORBING (ANTHROPOCENE URBAN) RIVERBED SEDIMENTS ARE PRESENT, EVEN FOR LONG HALF-LIVES. THEREFORE, ANTHROPOCENE-SEDIMENT OCCURRENCE MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE MODERN-DAY CONTAMINANT FATE WITHIN THE URBAN RIVERBED, THE PRINCIPAL IMPLICATION BEING GREATLY INCREASED SORPTION AND RESIDENCE TIMES MAY OCCUR IN URBAN RIVERBEDS THAN CONVENTIONALLY ASSUMED.

THE MULTIFACTORIAL INFLUENCE ADDS AN ELEMENT OF UNPREDICTABILITY TO THE OUTCOME OF THE MOST WELL-PLANNED PROCEDURE. CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS MAY NOT REFLECT THE STATUS OF THE ETV STOMA POSTPROCEDURE AND THE MORBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH ETV FAILURE COULD BE CATASTROPHIC. IN THIS STUDY, THE AUTHORS LOOK AT THE ROLE OF EARLY MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) TO PREDICT FAILURE TO AVOID MORBIDITY SECONDARY TO MALFUNCTION AND PROPOSE A MODIFIED SUCCESS CRITERION TO GUIDE TREATMENT PLAN POST-ETV FAILURE. OUR AIM IS TO PROSPECTIVELY AND RETROSPECTIVELY STUDY THE USE OF EARLY POSTOPERATIVE MRI IN PREDICTING POTENTIAL EARLY ETV FAILURE. METHODS: PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT ETV AT AMRITA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES FROM MARCH 2011 TO AUGUST 2017. THE STUDY WAS A RETROSPECTIVE AND PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL BLINDED STUDY. INCLUSION CRITERIA INCLUDED PATIENTS WITH ANY FORM OF OBSTRUCTIVE HYDROCEPHALUS WHO UNDERWENT ETV AND HAD UNDERGONE AN EARLY POSTOPERATIVE MRI IN THE FIRST 48 HOURSOR LATEST BY DISCHARGEWITH A FOLLOW-UP OF AT LEAST 3 MONTHS. THE PATIENT DETAILS AND THE PRESENCE OF THE FLOW VOID IN THE IMMEDIATE POSTOPERATIVE MRI WERE DOCUMENTED. FOLLOW-UP WAS FOR AT LEAST 3 MONTHS TO IDENTIFY EARLY FAILURES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 67 ETVS WERE PERFORMED IN 65 PATIENTS. AT 3 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP, OF THE 59 ETVS WITH FLOW VOID ON MRI, 53 WERE SUCCESSFUL, WHEREAS 6 FAILED. OF THE 8 WITHOUT FLOW VOID, 4 WERE SUCCESSFUL. THE OVERALL SENSITIVITY WAS 93.0, WHEREAS SPECIFICITY WAS 40.0. WITH INCREASING AGE, THE NEGATIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE IMPROVED FROM 25% IN AGE <1 YEAR TO 100% IN AGE >5 YEARS, WITH AN ACCURACY REACHING 96% TO PREDICT FAILURE OF ETV.

IN MOST LARGE URBAN AREAS, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AIR QUALITY MONITORING NETWORKS (AQMN) HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT PROVIDE AIR QUALITY (AQ) DATA FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES, E.G., TO MONITOR REGULATORY COMPLIANCE AND TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROL STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, THE CRITERIA OF STRUCTURING THE NETWORK ARE CURRENTLY DEFINED BY SINGLE QUESTIONS RATHER THAN ATTEMPTING TO CREATE A NETWORK TO SERVE MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS. HERE WE PROPOSE A METHODOLOGY SUPPORTED BY NUMERICAL, CONCEPTUAL AND GIS FRAMEWORKS FOR STRUCTURING AQMN USING SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC INDICATORS AS A CASE STUDY IN SHEFFIELD, UK. THE MAIN FACTORS USED FOR AIR QUALITY MONITORING STATION (AQMS) SELECTION ARE POPULATION-WEIGHTED POLLUTION CONCENTRATION (PWPC) AND WEIGHTED SPATIAL VARIABILITY (WSV) INCORPORATING POPULATION DENSITY (SOCIAL INDICATOR), POLLUTION LEVELS AND SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF AIR POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS (ENVIRONMENTAL INDICATOR). TOTAL NUMBER OF SENSORS IS DECIDED ON THE BASIS OF BUDGET (ECONOMIC INDICATOR), WHEREAS THE NUMBER OF SENSORS DEPLOYED IN EACH OUTPUT AREA IS PROPORTIONAL TO WSV. THE PURPOSE OF AQ MONITORING AND ITS ROLE IN DETERMINING THE LOCATION OF AQMS IS ANALYSED. FURTHERMORE, THE EXISTING AQMN IS ANALYSED AND AN ALTERNATIVE PROPOSED FOLLOWING A FORMAL PROCEDURE.

IN SOME CASES, THE SURGEON MAY OPT TO PERFORM AN AWAKE CRANIOTOMY INCLUDING INTRAOPERATIVE MAPPING OF BRAIN FUNCTION BY DIRECT CORTICAL STIMULATION (DCS) TO ASSIST IN SURGICAL DECISION-MAKING. PREOPERATIVELY, FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI) FACILITATES PLANNING BY IDENTIFICATION OF ELOQUENT BRAIN AREAS, HELPING TO GUIDE DCS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE SURGICAL PLAN. HOWEVER, BRAIN DEFORMATION (SHIFT) LIMITS THE USEFULNESS OF PREOPERATIVE FMRI DURING SURGERY. TO ADDRESS THIS, AN INTEGRATED VISUALIZATION METHOD FOR FMRI AND DCS RESULTS IS DEVELOPED THAT IS INTUITIVE FOR THE SURGEON. METHODS: AN IMAGE REGISTRATION PIPELINE WAS CONSTRUCTED TO DISPLAY PREOPERATIVE FMRI DATA CORRECTED FOR BRAIN SHIFT OVERLAID ON IMAGES OF THE EXPOSED CORTICAL SURFACE AT THE BEGINNING AND COMPLETION OF DCS MAPPING. PREOPERATIVE FMRI AND DCS DATA WERE REGISTERED FOR A RANGE OF MISALIGNMENTS, AND THE RESIDUAL REGISTRATION ERRORS WERE CALCULATED. THE PIPELINE WAS VALIDATED ON IMAGING DATA FROM FIVE BRAIN TUMOR PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT AWAKE CRANIOTOMY. RESULTS: REGISTRATION ERRORS WERE WELL UNDER 5 MM (THE APPROXIMATE SPATIAL RESOLUTION OF DCS) FOR MISALIGNMENTS OF UP TO 25 MM AND APPROXIMATELY 1015. FOR ROTATIONAL MISALIGNMENTS UP TO 20 THE SUCCESS RATE WAS 95% FOR AN ERROR TOLERANCE OF 5 MM. FAILURES WERE NEGLIGIBLE FOR ROTATIONAL MISALIGNMENTS UP TO 10.

AN ADVANTAGE OF THE ALTERNATIVE DVFS IS THAT MEASUREMENTS CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE RB OZONE, THEREBY INCREASING THE USE OF MEASUREMENTS IN THE DVF ESTIMATES. WE SIMULATED OZONE FORMATION IN THE HOUSTON AREA FOR MAYSEPTEMBER 2012 AND 2028 USING THE COMPREHENSIVE AIR QUALITY MODEL WITH EXTENSIONS AND COMPARED THE STANDARD AND ALTERNATIVE RRFS AND DVFS. IF MODEL RESULTS ARE USED FOR ALL THE RB OZONE CONCENTRATIONS IN OUR NEW EQUATION TO CALCULATE DVFS, THE ALTERNATIVE AND STANDARD DVFS ARE VERY SIMILAR FOR HOUSTON-GALVESTON-BRAZORIA (HGB). IF MEASUREMENTS ARE USED FOR THE RB OZONE CONCENTRATIONS WE COMBINE WITH THE BASE-YEAR DVS, THE ALTERNATIVE DVFS ARE NOTICEABLY LARGER THAN THE STANDARD DVFS FOR ABOUT HALF THE SITES, WITH THE INCREASE BEING 7 PPB AT THE SITE (DEER PARK) WITH THE LARGEST STANDARD AND ALTERNATIVE DVFS. THE DIFFERENCES ARISE PRIMARILY FROM INCLUDING DIFFERENT DAYS IN THE AVERAGING PROCESS FOR THE RRFS VERSUS THE BASE-YEAR DVS. WE EVALUATED MODEL PERFORMANCE FOR THE DAYS INCLUDED IN THE RRFS AND FOUND THAT THE MODEL OVER-PREDICTED RB OZONE (NORMALIZED MEAN BIAS (NMB)=26%) AND UNDER-PREDICTED THE ANTHROPOGENIC OZONE INCREMENT (NMB=-22%) FROM HGB EMISSIONS AND THEREFORE CAN BE EXPECTED TO UNDER-ESTIMATE OZONE RESPONSE TO HGB EMISSION CONTROLS. 2019 THE AUTHORS","CAMX; DESIGN VALUE; HOUSTON; OZONE; REGIONAL BACKGROUND; RELATIVE REDUCTION FACTOR","AIR QUALITY; CAMX; DESIGN VALUE; HOUSTON; REGIONAL BACKGROUND; RELATIVE REDUCTION FACTORS; OZONE; OZONE; AIR QUALITY; ANTHROPOGENIC EFFECT; ATMOSPHERIC MODELING; BACKGROUND LEVEL; CONCENTRATION (COMPOSITION); DESIGN METHOD; ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR; ESTIMATION METHOD; FUTURE PROSPECT; OZONE; REDUCTION; STANDARD (REFERENCE); AIR MONITORING; AIR POLLUTION; AIR QUALITY STANDARD; ARTICLE; MEASUREMENT; MODEL; POLLUTION MONITORING; PREDICTION; PRIORITY JOURNAL; SIMULATION; BRAZORIA COUNTY; GALVESTON; HOUSTON; TEXAS; UNITED STATES; CERVIDAE","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"LLC, 4041 VENDOME DRIVE, AUBURN HILLS, MI 48326, UNITED STATES; RAMBOLL, 7250 REDWOOD BLVD., SUITE 105, NOVATO, CA 94945, UNITED STATES","10.1016/J.AEAOA.2019.100029","100029","DUNKER, A.M., LLC, 4041 VENDOME DRIVE, UNITED STATES, EMAIL: AMDUNKERLLCGMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"25901621",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","2",2019,"none","NOTREPORTED","NOTREPORTED",NA,"DUNKER AM, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X","DUNKER AM, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X"

THIS STUDY FOCUSSES ON THE VOLATILIZATION FROM CROP RESIDUES, DEFINED AS RESIDUES AFTER A MANAGEMENT ACTION OR FROST I.E. RESIDUES THAT ARE LEFT ON THE FIELD AFTER HARVEST, AFTER KILLING BY USE OF HERBICIDES OR AFTER FROST. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A GENERAL METHODOLOGY TO CALCULATE THE VOLATILIZATION FROM CROP RESIDUES AND TO ESTIMATE THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE NH3 VOLATILIZATION AT A NATIONAL SCALE. A REGRESSION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED TO ASSESS THE NH3 VOLATILIZATION FROM CROP RESIDUE BASED ON THE NITROGEN (N) CONTENT OF THE RESIDUE (EMISSION FACTOR). INFORMATION ON FARM PRACTICES (DEGREE OF INCORPORATION OF RESIDUES, THE APPLICATION OF CROP KILLING AND MOWING FREQUENCY OF GRASS), HARVESTED CROP AREAS, AND N LOAD IN CROP WAS USED TO CALCULATE THE EMISSION FROM CROP RESIDUES AT NATIONAL SCALE. THE CONTRIBUTION OF CROP RESIDUES TO THE NATIONAL NH3 VOLATILIZATION IN THE NETHERLANDS WAS SUBSTANTIAL AND CALCULATED AT 1.9 MILLION KG NH3-N. GRASSLAND CONTRIBUTED ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF TOTAL NH3 VOLATILIZATION FROM CROP RESIDUES. MOST VOLATILIZATION OCCURS FROM THE MOWING LOSSES (54%) AND RENOVATION OF GRASSLAND (14%). RESIDUES OF ARABLE CROPS ALSO HAVE A CONTRIBUTION OF 14% TO TOTAL VOLATILIZATION. WITHIN ARABLE CROPS, POTATOES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE NH3 VOLATILIZATION, WITH THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTION FROM SEED POTATOES, FOLLOWED BY SUGAR BEET AND CABBAGE CROPS. NH3 VOLATILIZATION FROM GREEN MANURE CROP RESIDUES (KILLED BY FREEZING OR SPRAYING HERBICIDES) IS ABOUT HALF THE VOLATILIZATION FROM ARABLE CROP RESIDUES (7%). THE DEVELOPED GENERAL APPROACH FOR ESTIMATING THE NH3 VOLATILIZATION FROM CROP RESIDUES WAS APPLIED FOR THE NETHERLANDS BUT MAY ALSO BE APPLICABLE TO OTHER COUNTRIES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THEIR SITE SPECIFIC EMISSION FACTORS AND FARM PRACTICES STATISTICS. 2019","AMMONIA; AMMONIA VOLATILIZATION; ARABLE CROP; CROP RESIDUE; GRASSLAND","AMMONIA; FERTILIZERS; HERBICIDES; MANURES; REGRESSION ANALYSIS; SUGAR BEETS; WEED CONTROL; AMMONIA EMISSIONS; AMMONIA VOLATILIZATION; ARABLE CROPS; CROP RESIDUE; GENERAL METHODOLOGIES; GRASSLAND; GREEN MANURE CROPS; REGRESSION MODEL; CROPS; AMMONIA; GREEN MANURE; HERBICIDE; NITROGEN; AGRICULTURAL EMISSION; AMMONIA; ARABLE LAND; CROP PLANT; CROP RESIDUE; EMISSION; GRASSLAND; METHODOLOGY; AIR POLLUTION; ARTICLE; CABBAGE; FREEZING; GRASSLAND; NETHERLANDS; PESTICIDE SPRAYING; PLANT RESIDUE; PLANT SEED; POTATO; PRIORITY JOURNAL; REGRESSION ANALYSIS; SUGAR BEET; VOLATILIZATION; NETHERLANDS; BETA VULGARIS SUBSP.

THIS STRATEGIC DRIVE COMPRISES OF BOTH DIRECT TESTING OF BIVALVE FLESH FOR THE PRESENCE OF REGULATED TOXINS AND AN EARLY WARNING PHYTOPLANKTON MONITORING PROGRAMME. IN THE UK THE FLESH TESTING MOVED AWAY FROM ANIMAL BIO-ASSAYS TO ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY TECHNIQUES, WHEREAS PHYTOPLANKTON MONITORING METHODS HAVE SEEN LITTLE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT SINCE IMPLEMENTATION. METHODS CURRENTLY UTILIZE LIGHT MICROSCOPY AND MANUAL ENUMERATION OF DIFFERENT ALGAL SPECIES. THESE METHODS ALTHOUGH PROVEN ARE TIME CONSUMING, RELIANT ON HIGHLY TRAINED STAFF, HAVE HIGH LIMITS OF DETECTION (LOD) WITH LOW SPECIFICITY, UNABLE TO RELIABLY IDENTIFY ALEXANDRIUM TO SPECIES LEVEL. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE LIMITATIONS OF THE TECHNIQUES MEAN THAT IN THE CASE OF ALEXANDRIUM THE LOD IS ALSO THE ACTION LIMIT AND AS SUCH IT IS EASY TO MISS POSITIVE SAMPLES AFFECTING THE EFFICACY OF ANY EARLY WARNING STRATEGY.

HOWEVER, IN CASES OF SYMPTOMATIC, IRREDUCIBLE VENTRAL COMPRESSION, 360 DECOMPRESSION OF THE BRAINSTEM SUPPORTED BY POSTERIOR STABILIZATION MAY PROVIDE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS. MORE RECENTLY, THE ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL CORRIDOR HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF ODONTOIDECTOMY ASSOCIATED WITH LESS MORBIDITY. WE REPORT THE LARGEST SINGLE CASE SERIES OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS USING THIS DUAL-INTERVENTION SURGICAL TECHNIQUE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE SURGICAL OUTCOMES OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT POSTERIOR OCCIPITOCERVICAL DECOMPRESSION AND INSTRUMENTATION FOLLOWED BY ENDOSCOPIC ENDONASAL ODONTOIDECTOMY PERFORMED TO RELIEVE NEUROLOGIC IMPINGEMENT INVOLVING THE VENTRAL BRAINSTEM AND CRANIOCERVICAL JUNCTION. METHODS: BETWEEN JANUARY 2011 AND FEBRUARY 2017, 7 PATIENTS UNDERWENT POSTERIOR INSTRUMENTED FUSION FOLLOWED BY ENDONASAL ENDOSCOPIC ODONTOIDECTOMY AT OUR UNIT. STANDARDIZED CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER SURGERY. A UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO ASSESS CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGIC IMPROVEMENT AFTER SURGERY. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 14 OPERATIONS WERE PERFORMED ON 7 PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. ONE PATIENT HAD EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME, 1 PATIENT HAD A CHIARI 1 MALFORMATION, AND THE REMAINING 5 PATIENTS HAD CHIARI 1.5 MALFORMATIONS. AVERAGE EXTUBATION DAY WAS POSTOPERATIVE DAY 0.9.

THE OBSERVED SEASONAL CYCLE IS COMPARED WITH THE SEASONAL CYCLE THAT IS OBSERVED AT THE TOTAL CARBON COLUMN OBSERVING NETWORK (TCCON) SITE IN TSUKUBA, WHICH IS LOCATED 60 KM TO THE NORTHEASTERN DIRECTION OF TOKYO. THE DIFFERENCES IN XCO2 BETWEEN THE TWO SITES ARE HIGH (5 PPM) DURING DECEMBER FEBRUARY AND LOW (0.5 PPM) DURING JUNE SEPTEMBER. THE CHARACTERISTIC VARIATIONS OF XCO2 IN TOKYO ARE INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF LOCAL EMISSION SOURCES AND SURFACE METEOROLOGICAL DATA, BY REFERRING TO THE VARIATIONS IN THE CONCENTRATIONS OF SURFACE CO2. THE SHARP PEAKS IN XCO2 AT BOTH THE TOKYO AND TSUKUBA SITES IN JULY ARE INTERPRETED IN TERMS OF LOCAL AIR RETENTION IN THE AREAS, AS INDICATED BY THE AIRCRAFT PROFILES AND WIND-FLOW FORWARD TRAJECTORY CALCULATIONS.

PAPHIES AUSTRALIS, AN ENDEMIC CLAM FOUND IN NEW ZEALAND, HAS BEEN FOUND TO CONTAIN TTX IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS. HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN IF THIS REPRESENTS ENDOGENOUS PRODUCTION OR ACCUMULATION FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE. TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION, THE CONCENTRATIONS OF TTX IN WHOLE P.

DEPURATION RATE OF TTX WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED BY HARVESTING AND MEASURING CONCENTRATIONS IN P. AUSTRALIS MAINTAINED IN CAPTIVITY ON A TOXIN-FREE DIET EVERY THREE TO 15 DAYS FOR 150 DAYS. THE LC-MS/MS ANALYSES OF THE SPATIAL SAMPLES SHOWED THAT TTX WAS PRESENT IN P.

ON A SMALLER SCALE THE DUST LOAD HAS A HIGH VARIABILITY ACROSS STREETS DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN RATES OF SUSPENSION FROM DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ROAD SURFACE, WITH LOW AMOUNTS IN WHEEL TRACKS AND HIGHER IN-BETWEEN AND OUTSIDE THE TRACKS. BETWEEN 2 AND 30% OF THE DL180 IS SMALLER THAN 10 M AND COULD DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTE TO PM10 EMISSIONS. IN GENERAL, HIGHER ROAD SURFACE TEXTURE LEADS TO HIGHER DUST LOADS, BUT THE CONDITION OF THE PAVEMENT (E.G. CRACKS, AGGREGATE LOSS) MIGHT ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT. A NEW, WEAR RESISTANT PAVEMENT ACCUMULATED MARKEDLY HIGHER ROAD DUST AMOUNTS THAN A SEVERAL YEARS OLD PAVEMENT. THIS PAPER CLOSES WITH A DISCUSSION ON THE COMPLEX RELATION BETWEEN ROAD DUST LOAD AND PM10 CONCENTRATIONS AND A DISCUSSION ON THE CHALLENGES AND COMPARABILITY OF ROAD DUST SAMPLING TECHNIQUES AND MEASURES. 2019 THE AUTHORS","MACRO TEXTURE; NON-EXHAUST; PM10; SAMPLING; SPATIAL VARIATION; TEMPORAL VARIATION","DUST; PARTICLES (PARTICULATE MATTER); PARTICULATE EMISSIONS; PAVEMENTS; SAMPLING; TEXTURES; WEAR OF MATERIALS; MACROTEXTURES; NON-EXHAUST; PM10; SPATIAL VARIATIONS; TEMPORAL VARIATION; AIR POLLUTION; ASPHALT; ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION; CONCENTRATION (COMPOSITION); DUST; MAINTENANCE; PAVEMENT; ROAD; SAMPLING; SEASONAL VARIATION; SPATIAL VARIATION; TEMPORAL VARIATION; WINTER; ARTICLE; AUTUMN; DUST; DYNAMICS; PARTICULATE MATTER; PRIORITY JOURNAL; SEASONAL VARIATION; SPRING; SUMMER; SURFACE PROPERTY; SUSPENSION; SWEDEN; WINTER; STOCKHOLM [SWEDEN]; SWEDEN","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",1,"SWEDISH NATIONAL ROAD AND TRANSPORT RESEARCH INSTITUTE (VTI), LINKPING, SE 581 95, SWEDEN; RESEARCH INSTITUTES OF SWEDEN (RISE), BOX 857, BORS, SE 501 15, SWEDEN; SLB-ANALYS, BOX 8136, STOCKHOLM, SE 104 20, SWEDEN; DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY (ACES), STOCKHOLM UNIVERSITY, STOCKHOLM, SE 106 91, SWEDEN","10.1016/J.AEAOA.2019.100014","100014","GUSTAFSSON, M., VTISWEDEN, EMAIL: MATS.GUSTAFSSONVTI.SE",NA,NA,"25901621",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","2",2019,"none","SWEDISH NATIONAL ROAD AND TRANSPORT RESEARCH INSTITUTE (VTI);RESEARCH INSTITUTES OF SWEDEN (RISE);STOCKHOLM UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED",NA,"GUSTAFSSON M, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X","GUSTAFSSON M, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X"

WE DISCUSS THE SURGICAL INDICATIONS AND RISKS OF KEYHOLE CLIPPING FOR ICA ANEURYSMS BASED ON LONG-TERM CLINICAL AND RADIOLOGIC RESULTS. METHODS: THIS WAS A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF 51 PATIENTS (AGED 3575 YEARS, MEAN 62 YEARS) WITH ICA ANEURYSMS (MEAN 5.8 1.8 MM) WHO UNDERWENT CLIPPING VIA THE SUPRAORBITAL KEYHOLE APPROACH BETWEEN 2005 AND 2017. NEUROLOGIC AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS WERE EXAMINED BY SEVERAL METHODS, INCLUDING THE MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE AND MINI-MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION. THE STATE OF CLIPPING WAS ASSESSED 1 YEAR AND THEN EVERY FEW YEARS AFTER THE OPERATION. RESULTS: COMPLETE CLIPPING WAS CONFIRMED IN 45 PATIENTS (88.2%), DOG-EAR REMNANTS BEHIND THE CLIP PERSISTED IN 4 PATIENTS, AND WRAPPING WAS PERFORMED IN 2 PATIENTS. MEAN DURATION OF POSTOPERATIVE HOSPITALIZATION WAS 3.4 6.9 DAYS. THE MEAN CLINICAL FOLLOW-UP PERIOD WAS 6.6 3.2 YEARS. THE OVERALL MORTALITY WAS 0, AND OVERALL MORBIDITY (MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE SCORE 2 OR MINI-MENTAL STATUS EXAMINATION <24) WAS 3.9%.

ML TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN TRADITIONALLY APPLIED TO LARGE, HIGHLY DIMENSIONAL DATABASES. GLIOMAS ARE A HETEROGENEOUS GROUP OF PRIMARY BRAIN TUMORS, TRADITIONALLY GRADED USING HISTOPATHOLOGIC FEATURES. RECENTLY, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION PROPOSED A NOVEL GRADING SYSTEM FOR GLIOMAS INCORPORATING MOLECULAR CHARACTERISTICS. WE AIMED TO STUDY WHETHER ML COULD ACHIEVE ACCURATE PROGNOSTICATION OF 2-YEAR MORTALITY IN A SMALL, HIGHLY DIMENSIONAL DATABASE OF PATIENTS WITH GLIOMA. METHODS: WE APPLIED 3 ML TECHNIQUES (ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS [ANNS], DECISION TREES [DTS], AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES [SVMS]) AND CLASSICAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION (LR) TO A DATASET CONSISTING OF 76 PATIENTS WITH GLIOMA OF ALL GRADES. WE COMPARED THE EFFECT OF APPLYING THE ALGORITHMS TO THE RAW DATABASE VERSUS A DATABASE WHERE ONLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FEATURES WERE INCLUDED INTO THE ALGORITHMIC INPUTS (FEATURE SELECTION). RESULTS: RAW INPUT CONSISTED OF 21 VARIABLES AND ACHIEVED PERFORMANCE OF ACCURACY/AREA (C.I.)

THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE CONCENTRATIONS OF HEAVY METALS AND NUTRIENTS IN THE PHWW, AS WELL AS THE PRESENCE OF INDICATOR PATHOGENS. IN ADDITION, FOUR DIFFERENT WATER TREATMENT METHODS WERE USED: (1) DILUTION OF RAW PHWW, (2) SAND FILTRATION AFTER DILUTION, (3) SAND AND CARBON FILTRATION AFTER DILUTION, AND (4) REVERSE OSMOSIS AFTER DILUTION. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE CONCENTRATIONS OF CADMIUM, LEAD, AND ARSENIC IN RAW PHWW WERE WELL BELOW THE MAXIMUM RECOMMENDED CONCENTRATIONS SET BY THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (US EPA) FOR WATER REUSE. IN ADDITION, THE TREATMENT METHODS IN THIS STUDY ACHIEVED PERCENT REMOVALS RANGING FROM 82-100% FOR CADMIUM, 99-100% FOR MERCURY, 75-99.5% FOR LEAD, AND 71-99% FOR ARSENIC. NITROGEN IN RAW PHWW WAS PREDOMINANTLY IN THE TOTAL N FORM, PREVENTING IT FROM BEING ACCESSIBLE TO PLANTS.

IN THIS WORK, WE INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF BI-TORTUOSITY ON DESALINATION PERFORMANCE BY ETCHING MACROPOROUS PATTERNS ALONG THE LENGTH OF ACTIVATED CARBON POROUS ELECTRODES IN A FLOW-BY CDI ARCHITECTURE. CAPACITIVE ELECTRODES WERE ALSO COATED WITH THIN ASYMMETRICALLY CHARGED POLYELECTROLYTES TO IMPROVE ION-SELECTIVITY WHILE MAINTAINING THE BITORTUOUS MACROPOROUS CHANNELS.

A CROSS-SCALE COMPARISON","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X","JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X","REGIONAL TO GLOBAL RIVER HYDRODYNAMIC MODELS ARE NOW A REALITY, AND HAVE LARGELY IMPROVED IN THE RECENT YEARS DUE TO INCREASING COMPUTATION POWER, REMOTE SENSING DATASETS AND NEW MODELING METHODS. IT IS FUNDAMENTAL THEN TO UNDERSTAND TO WHICH EXTENT THESE MODELS CAN PROVIDE LOCALLY RELEVANT ESTIMATES OF VARIABLES AS DISCHARGE AND WATER LEVELS. IT IS ADDRESSED HERE BY SETTING UP THREE DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE LARGE SCALE MGB HYDROLOGIC-HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL WITH INCREASING SPATIAL SCALE (GLOBAL, REGIONAL AND LOCAL), BASED ON DIFFERENT TOPOGRAPHY DATASETS, CROSS SECTION PARAMETERIZATION AND REACH LENGTHS. THESE MODEL VERSIONS ARE THEN COMPARED TO A DETAILED HEC-RAS MODEL, SET UP WITH >620 LOCALLY SURVEYED CROSS SECTIONS IN THE ITAJA-AU BASIN IN BRAZIL. ALL MODELS ARE RUN WITH CALIBRATED RAINFALL-RUNOFF PARAMETERS, SO THAT EFFECTS OF NON-CALIBRATED RUNOFF FIELDS OR UNCERTAIN FORCING DATA ARE NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. TO ASSIST INTERPRETATION, THREE MAIN REQUIREMENTS TO DEFINE ESTIMATES FROM A RIVER HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL AS LOCALLY RELEVANT ARE DEFINED: THE MODEL ERRORS SHOULD BE EQUAL OR SMALLER (I) THAN THE ACCURACY REQUIREMENT FOR A PARTICULAR APPLICATION AND LOCATION, (II) THAN TYPICAL LOCAL, REACH SCALE MODELS ERRORS, AND (III) THAN OBSERVATION UNCERTAINTIES. RESULTS THEN INDICATE THAT THE REGIONAL AND LOCAL MGB VERSIONS (AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE GLOBAL ONE) COULD ESTIMATE LOCALLY RELEVANT DISCHARGES AND WATER LEVEL ANOMALIES FOR MANY PARTS OF THE BASIN. FOR ABSOLUTE WATER LEVELS, ALL MODELS FAILED TO PROVIDE RMSE SMALLER THAN 0.4 M BASIN-WIDE, ALTHOUGH THE LOCAL MGB MODEL YIELDS AN AVERAGE 2.1 M RMSE, IN COMPARISON TO 4.4 M (REGIONAL) AND 26.1 M (GLOBAL). FOR FLOOD EXTENT, ALL MODEL VERSIONS GENERALLY YIELDED UNSATISFACTORY RESULTS WITH AVERAGE FIT METRIC VALUES SMALLER THAN 65%. LASTLY, DIFFERENT SETUPS OF THE REGIONAL MGB MODEL WERE RUN TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT FACTORS IN IMPROVING MODEL ESTIMATES. RESULTS SHOWED THAT A COARSE REACH LENGTH (15 KM) IS UNABLE TO CAPTURE FLOOD DYNAMICS AND WATER LEVEL VARIATIONS IN THE BASIN, WHILE A SMALLER 1 KM LONG REACH IMPROVES DISCHARGES, WATER LEVEL AND FLOOD EXTENT. A LOCALLY DERIVED DEM DID NOT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN RELATION TO A GLOBAL DEM. IN TURN, THE SMALLEST WATER LEVEL ERRORS WOULD BE ATTAINED BY USING INFORMATION FROM THE IN-SITU CROSS SECTIONS IN THE REGIONAL MODELS.

X","BACKGROUND: WE HAVE BEEN PERFORMING THE CLIPPING ON CROSSED WRAPPING (COCW) METHOD USING 2 STRIPS OF COTTON ON PATIENTS WITH AN INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY BLOOD BLISTER-LIKE ANEURYSM (IC-BLA). THIS METHOD IS RELIABLE IN PREVENTING THE CLIPS FROM SLIPPING OFF AND THE ANEURYSM WALLS FROM BEING DAMAGED DURING CLIPPING, AND IT ENABLES MORE APPROPRIATE AND SAFER CLIPPING. HERE WE REPORT THE TECHNICAL DETAILS OF THIS METHOD AND THE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS RECEIVING THIS PROCEDURE. METHODS: FIFTEEN OF 1275 (1.5%) PATIENTS WITH A RUPTURED CEREBRAL ANEURYSM WHO RECEIVED TREATMENT AT THE SAISEIKAI KUMAMOTO HOSPITAL DURING THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 1999, TO DECEMBER 31, 2016, HAD AN IC-BLA. ALL 15 PATIENTS WERE TREATED WITH COCW, EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST PATIENT, WHO WAS TREATED USING A SINGLE STRIP OF COTTON. THE LONG-TERM OUTCOME OF THE TREATMENT WAS ANALYZED. RESULTS: THE MEAN FOLLOW-UP PERIOD WAS 74 MONTHS. THE FIRST PATIENT EXPERIENCED RERUPTURE OF AN ANEURYSM 10 DAYS AFTER THE OPERATION. NO COMPLICATIONS OR REGROWTH OF AN ANEURYSM WERE OBSERVED IN THE REMAINING 14 PATIENTS DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, EXCEPT FOR 1 PATIENT WHO RECEIVED A REOPERATION FOR THE REGROWTH OF AN ANEURYSM. AS THE FINAL OUTCOME, THE NUMBERS OF PATIENTS WITH A MODIFIED RANKIN SCORE OF 0, 3, AND 6 WERE 13, 1, AND 1, RESPECTIVELY.

FLOW INTERMITTENCY SENSORS OFFER A RELATIVELY NEW APPROACH TO CHARACTERIZE WET STREAM LENGTH DYNAMICS AT HIGH SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL RESOLUTIONS. WE INSTALLED 51 FLOW INTERMITTENCY SENSORS AT AN AVERAGE SPACING OF 40M ALONG THE STREAM NETWORK OF A HIGH-RELIEF, HEADWATER CATCHMENT (33HA) IN THE VALLEY AND RIDGE OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. THE SENSORS RECORDED THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF WATER EVERY 15MIN FOR 10MONTHS. CALCULATIONS OF THE WET NETWORK PROPORTION FROM SENSOR DATA ALIGNED WITH THOSE FROM FIELD MEASUREMENTS, CONFIRMING THE EFFICACY OF FLOW INTERMITTENCY SENSORS. THE FINE TEMPORAL SCALE OF THE SENSOR DATA SHOWED HYSTERESIS IN WET STREAM LENGTH: THE WET NETWORK PROPORTION WAS UP TO 50% GREATER ON THE RISING LIMB OF STORM EVENTS THAN ON THE FALLING LIMB FOR DRY ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS, AT TIMES WITH A DELAY OF SEVERAL HOURS BETWEEN THE MAXIMUM WET PROPORTION AND PEAK RUNOFF AT THE CATCHMENT OUTLET. LESS STREAM LENGTH HYSTERESIS WAS EVIDENT FOR LARGER STORMS WITH HIGHER EVENT AND ANTECEDENT PRECIPITATION THAT RESULTED IN PEAK RUNOFF > 15MM/DAY. TO ASSESS SPATIAL CONTROLS ON STREAM WETTING AND DRYING, WE PERFORMED A CORRELATION ANALYSIS BETWEEN FLOW DURATION AT THE SENSOR LOCATIONS AND COMMON TOPOGRAPHIC METRICS USED IN STREAM NETWORK MODELING. TOPOGRAPHY DID NOT FULLY EXPLAIN SPATIAL VARIATION IN FLOW DURATION ALONG THE STREAM NETWORK.

ENVIRON. X","THE FIREWORKS ACTIVITY IN CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR IS THE CULPRIT OF A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE PARTICLES POLLUTION DURING THOSE FESTIVITY DATES IN MEXICO CITY. THE FIREWORKS THRILLING EXPLOSIONS FILL THE AIR WITH SMALL PARTICLES FULL OF METALS AND ORGANIC AND INORGANIC SPECIES, AND NOXIOUS GASES SUCH AS SULFUR DIOXIDE, NITROGEN DIOXIDE, CARBON MONOXIDE AND NITROUS ACID (HONO). THE STAGNANT ATMOSPHERE AT NIGHT ACCUMULATES THE FIREWORKS HAZE UNDER A SHALLOW BOUNDARY LAYER. BY SUNRISE, ONCE THE FIREWORKS ACTIVITY HAS STOPPED, THE PHOTOLYSIS OF THE ABUNDANT HONO ACCUMULATED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT, LEADS TO A RAPID PRODUCTION OF NITRATE (NO3), AMMONIUM (NH4+), SULFATE (SO42) AND LOW VOLATILITY SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOLS. THIS WAS THE PATTERN OBSERVED DURING THE WINTER OF 20132014, WHEN ONLINE MEASUREMENTS OF WATER-SOLUBLE INORGANIC IONS IN PARTICLES SMALLER THAN 2.5 M (PM2.5), NON-REFRACTORY IONS AND ORGANICS IN PARTICLES SMALLER THAN 1 M (PM1), EQUIVALENT BLACK CARBON, AND ABOVE-MENTIONED GASES WERE CONDUCTED. THE GEOMETRIC AVERAGE OF THE SUM OF THE THREE MAJOR INORGANIC IONS, NO3, NH4+ AND SO42 ACCOUNTED FOR 25% (28%) AND 34% (37%) OF THE TOTAL PM2.5 MASS DURING THE FIREWORKS ACTIVITY AT NIGHT AND THE FOLLOWING MORNING ON CHRISTMAS DAY (NEW YEAR'S DAY), RESPECTIVELY. SIMILARLY, THEIR SUM IN THE NON-REFRACTORY FRACTION ACCOUNTED FOR 37% (49%) AND 47% (53%) OF THE TOTAL NR-PM1 MASS CONCENTRATION, WHILE THE ORGANIC FRACTION ACCOUNTED FOR 56% (44%) AND 49% (44%). BIOMASS BURNING ORGANIC AEROSOLS AND SEMI-VOLATILE OXYGENATED ORGANIC AEROSOLS (BBOA AND SV-OOA, RESPECTIVELY) DOMINATED THE ORGANIC FRACTION DURING THE FIREWORKS PERIOD AT NIGHT, WHILE THE LOW-VOLATILITY OXYGENATED ORGANIC AEROSOLS (LV-OOA) INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY THEIR CONCENTRATION ALONG THE POST-FIREWORK HOURS THE FOLLOWING MORNING.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE BASELINE PREHOSPITAL (PH) FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTCOMES FROM THE ANDHRA PRADESH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY PROJECT. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH TBI ADMITTED TO THE PRIMARY REFERRAL HOSPITAL. MODES OF INJURY, PREHOSPITAL CARE AND TRANSPORT, AND FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED IN-HOSPITAL MORTALITY WERE EVALUATED. POISSON REGRESSION WITH ROBUST ERROR VARIANCE AND ADJUSTED ATTRIBUTABLE RISK PERCENT ESTIMATES DETERMINED FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTCOMES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 447 ADULTS (38% WITH MILD TBI, 30% WITH MODERATE TBI, AND 32% WITH SEVERE TBI, 81% MEN) WITH ISOLATED TBI (89%) FROM ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS (48.1%) OR FALLS (46.5%) WERE ENROLLED.

THIS STUDY SHOWS THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN MODELLING CARBONACEOUS AEROSOL OVER EUROPE BY COMPARING SIMULATIONS PERFORMED WITH SEVEN CHEMICAL TRANSPORT MODELS (CTMS) CURRENTLY IN AIR QUALITY ASSESSMENTS IN EUROPE: CAMX, CHIMERE, CMAQ, EMEP/MSC-W, LOTOS-EUROS, MINNI AND RCGC. THE SIMULATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE EURODELTA III MODELLING EXERCISE AND WERE EVALUATED AGAINST FIELD MEASUREMENTS FROM INTENSIVE CAMPAIGNS OF EUROPEAN MONITORING AND EVALUATION PROGRAMME (EMEP) AND THE EUROPEAN INTEGRATED PROJECT ON AEROSOL CLOUD CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY INTERACTIONS (EUCAARI). MODEL SIMULATIONS WERE PERFORMED OVER THE SAME DOMAIN, USING AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE SAME INPUT DATA AND COVERING FOUR SEASONS: SUMMER (130 JUNE 2006), WINTER (8 JANUARY 4 FEBRUARY 2007), AUTUMN (17 SEPTEMBER- 15 OCTOBER 2008) AND SPRING (25 FEBRUARY - 26 MARCH 2009). THE ANALYSES OF MODELS PERFORMANCES IN PREDICTION OF ELEMENTAL CARBON (EC) FOR THE FOUR SEASONS AND ORGANIC AEROSOL COMPONENTS (OA) FOR THE LAST TWO SEASONS SHOW THAT ALL MODELS GENERALLY UNDERESTIMATE THE MEASURED CONCENTRATIONS. THE MAXIMUM UNDERESTIMATION OF EC IS ABOUT 60% AND UP TO ABOUT 80% FOR TOTAL ORGANIC MATTER (TOM). THE UNDERESTIMATION OF TOM OUTSIDE OF HIGHLY POLLUTED AREA IS A CONSEQUENCE OF AN UNDERESTIMATION OF SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL (SOA), IN PARTICULAR OF ITS MAIN CONTRIBUTOR: BIOGENIC SECONDARY AEROSOL (BSOA). THIS RESULT IS INDEPENDENT ON THE SOA MODELLING APPROACH USED AND SEASON. THE CONCENTRATIONS AND DAILY CYCLES OF TOTAL PRIMARY ORGANIC MATTER (TPOM) ARE GENERALLY BETTER REPRODUCED BY THE MODELS SINCE THEY USED THE SAME ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS. HOWEVER, THE COMBINATION OF EMISSIONS AND MODEL FORMULATION LEADS TO OVERESTIMATE TPOM CONCENTRATIONS IN 2009 FOR MOST OF THE MODELS. ALL MODELS CAPTURE RELATIVELY WELL THE SOA DAILY CYCLES AT RURAL STATIONS MAINLY DUE TO THE SPATIAL RESOLUTION USED IN THE SIMULATIONS. FOR THE INVESTIGATED CARBONACEOUS AEROSOL COMPOUNDS, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONCENTRATIONS SIMULATED BY DIFFERENT MODELS ARE LOWER THAN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONCENTRATIONS SIMULATED WITH A MODEL FOR DIFFERENT SEASONS. 2019 THE AUTHORS","ELEMENTAL CARBON; MODEL INTER-COMPARISON; MODEL VALIDATION; ORGANIC AEROSOL; SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL","AEROSOLS; AIR QUALITY; ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; BIOGEOCHEMISTRY; BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS; ORGANIC COMPOUNDS; QUALITY ASSURANCE; QUALITY CONTROL; ELEMENTAL CARBON; MODEL INTER COMPARISONS; MODEL VALIDATION; ORGANIC AEROSOL; SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOLS; ATMOSPHERIC MOVEMENTS; CARBON; ORGANIC MATTER; AEROSOL; AIR QUALITY; ANTHROPOGENIC SOURCE; ATMOSPHERIC MODELING; ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION; CONCENTRATION (COMPOSITION); ELEMENTAL CARBON; MODEL VALIDATION; ORGANIC MATTER; PHYSICOCHEMICAL PROPERTY; SEASONAL VARIATION; SPATIAL RESOLUTION; AIR POLLUTANT; AIR QUALITY; ARTICLE; CARBONACEOUS AEROSOL; CLIMATE; EUROPE; EXHAUST GAS; HEALTH HAZARD; PRIORITY JOURNAL; SEASON; SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL; SIMULATION; EUROPE","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",1,"ENEA, ITALIAN NATIONAL AGENCY FOR NEW TECHNOLOGIES, ENERGY AND SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, VIA MARTIRI DI MONTE SOLE 4, BOLOGNA, 40129, ITALY; INERIS, NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT AND RISKS, PARC TECHNOLOGIQUE ALATA, VERNEUIL-EN-HALATTE, 60550, FRANCE; RSE S.P.A., VIA RUBATTINO 54, MILAN, 20134, ITALY; PSI, LAC, PAUL SCHERRER INSTITUTE, VILLIGEN, PSI 5232, SWITZERLAND; CLIMATE MODELLING AND AIR POLLUTION DIVISION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT, NORWEGIAN METEOROLOGICAL INSTITUTE (MET NORWAY), P.O.

WHEN HEATING THE SINTERED SAMPLES TO THE VISCOUS STATE (APPROX. 10 8 10 6 PA S CORRESPONDING TO 650740 C), THE HIGH INTERNAL GAS PRESSURE IN THE CLOSED PORES EXPANDS THE GLASS MELT. WE HEAT-TREATED EACH SINTERED SAMPLE MULTIPLE TIMES IN AIR AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE TO GRADUALLY DECREASE THE DENSITY, AND THEREBY TO OBTAIN MULTIPLE VALUES OF EACH SAMPLE AT DIFFERENT DENSITIES, WHILE THE CHEMISTRY OF THE SAMPLE REMAINED ALMOST IDENTICAL. GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY REVEALED BINARY AR-CO 2 AND N 2 -CO 2 GAS COMPOSITIONS IN THE AR- AND N 2 -SINTERED SAMPLES, RESPECTIVELY. THE THERMAL CONDUCTIVITIES OF THESE GAS MIXTURES ( GAS,MIX ) WERE CALCULATED TO BE 16.4 AND 23.1 MW M 1 K 1 , PRESENTING 22 AND 31% OF THE EFFECTIVE FOR THE AR- AND N 2 -SINTERED SAMPLES, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOWER GAS,MIX RESULTED IN A LOWER OF THE AR-SINTERED SAMPLES COMPARED TO THE N 2 -SINTERED ONES AT LOW DENSITY (&LT,0.6 G CM 3 ). THEREFORE, IT IS CRUCIAL TO CONTROL THE GAS COMPOSITION FOR TAILORING OF LOW DENSITY GLASS FOAMS. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S)","CATHODE RAY TUBE PANEL GLASS; GAS COMPOSITION; GLASS FOAM; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY","ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY; ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE; CARBON DIOXIDE; CATHODE RAY TUBES; CATHODE RAYS; CATHODES; GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY; GLASS; GLASS MANUFACTURE; PORE SIZE; SINTERING; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF GASES; THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF SOLIDS; CELLULAR MATERIAL; DIFFERENT DENSITIES; ELEVATED PRESSURE; GAS COMPOSITIONS; GLASS FOAMS; HIGH PRESSURE SINTERING; INTERNAL GAS PRESSURE; THERMAL-INSULATING; GASES","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY AND BIOSCIENCE, AALBORG UNIVERSITY, AALBORG EAST, DK-9220, DENMARK; ADVANCED MATERIALS DEPARTMENT, JOEF STEFAN INSTITUTE, LJUBLJANA, SI-1000, SLOVENIA; INSTITUTE OF HIGH-PRESSURE PHYSICS, POLISH ACADEMY OF SCIENCES, WARSAW, PL-01-142, POLAND","10.1016/J.NOCX.2019.100014","100014","YUE, Y., DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY AND BIOSCIENCE, AALBORG UNIVERSITYDENMARK, EMAIL: YYBIO.AAU.DK",NA,NA,"25901591",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","1",2019,"none","AALBORG UNIVERSITY;JOEF STEFAN INSTITUTE;INSTITUTE OF HIGH-PRESSURE PHYSICS","AALBORG UNIVERSITYDENMARK",NA,"STERGAARD MB, 2019, J NON CRYST SOLIDS X","STERGAARD MB, 2019, J NON CRYST SOLIDS X"

BASED ON THIS CHARACTERIZATION, WE PROPOSE THAT FOAMGLAS BE USED AS A PROXY MATERIAL IN STUDIES OF THE DEFORMATIONAL BEHAVIOUR OF NATURAL CRYSTAL-FREE MELTS POPULATED WITH ISOLATED BUBBLES. WE DEMONSTRATE ITS UTILITY WITH A CASE STUDY: CORES OF FOAMGLAS ARE DEFORMED AT HIGH TEMPERATURE (>TG) IN UNIAXIAL COMPRESSION. DEFORMED FOAMGLAS SAMPLES RECORD A DIFFERENT PATTERN OF STRAIN ACCUMULATION (VOLUME LOSS VS. BULGING) COMPARED TO DEFORMED NATURAL MATERIALS WHERE BUBBLE CONNECTIVITY IS HIGH (E.G., SINTERED ASH, VESICULAR LAVAS). THE DIVERGENT BEHAVIOUR CAN BE ASCRIBED TO PRESSURIZATION OF THE ISOLATED GAS-FILLED BUBBLES AS A RESULT OF COMPRESSION. THE PRESSURIZED BUBBLES RESIST DEFORMATION, AND EXPAND WHEN UNLOADED. IN CONTRAST, THE HIGH CONNECTIVITY OF OPEN-CELL FOAMS ALLOWS GAS ESCAPE AND COLLAPSE OF PORE SPACE DURING COMPRESSION. THE DIFFERENT BEHAVIOURS OF OPEN- AND CLOSED-CELL MELT FOAMS HIGHLIGHT THE INFLUENCE OF ISOLATED BUBBLES ON MAGMA RHEOLOGY.

THE SCHRDINGER EQUATION DESCRIBES A NON-RELATIVISTIC QUANTUM PARTICLE, WHILE THE KLEINGORDON EQUATION DESCRIBES A RELATIVISTIC PARTICLE. THE CONDITIONAL CONVERGENCE OF THE DU FORTFRANKEL SCHEME TO SOLUTIONS OF THE SCHRDINGER EQUATION ARISES BECAUSE SOLUTIONS OF THE KLEINGORDON EQUATION ONLY APPROXIMATE SOLUTIONS OF THE SCHRDINGER EQUATION IN THE NON-RELATIVISTIC LIMIT.

THESE ANALYTES SHOWED REVERSED-PHASE (RP) RETENTION BEHAVIOUR WITH MOBILE PHASES OF &LT,40% (V/V) ACN CONTENT WITH BOTH STATIONARY PHASES BUT WITH THE BDC8 STATIONARY PHASE PROVIDING LONGER RETENTION. THE PERFLUOROC8, BUT NOT THE BDC8, STATIONARY PHASE ALSO EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT RETENTION OF THESE ANALYTES UNDER CONDITIONS TYPICAL OF AN AQUEOUS NORMAL PHASE (ANP) MODE (I.E. WITH MOBILE PHASES OF &GT,80% (V/V) ACN CONTENT), WITH THE ANALYTES EXHIBITING OVERALL U-SHAPE RETENTION DEPENDENCIES ON THE ACN CONTENT OF THE MOBILE PHASE. FURTHER, THESE STATIONARY PHASES SHOWED DIFFERENCES IN THEIR SELECTIVITY BEHAVIOUR WITH REGARD TO THE N-ALKYL CHAIN LENGTHS OF THE DIFFERENT ANALYTES. THESE OBSERVATIONS COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF PK A , LOG P, MOLECULAR MASS OR LINEAR SOLVATION ENERGY CONCEPTS. HOWEVER, DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY (DFT) SIMULATIONS PROVIDED A POSSIBLE EXPLANATION FOR THE OBSERVED SELECTIVITY TRENDS, NAMELY DIFFERENCES IN THE MOLECULAR GEOMETRIES AND STRUCTURAL ORGANISATION OF THE IMMOBILISED LIGANDS OF THESE TWO STATIONARY PHASES UNDER DIFFERENT SOLVATIONAL CONDITIONS. FOR MOBILE PHASE CONDITIONS FAVOURING THE RP MODE, THESE DFT SIMULATIONS REVEALED THAT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ADJACENT BDC8 LIGANDS OCCUR, LEADING TO A STATIONARY PHASE WITH A MORE HYDROPHOBIC SURFACE. MOREOVER, UNDER MOBILE PHASE CONDITIONS FAVOURING RETENTION OF THE ANALYTES IN AN ANP MODE, THESE INTERACTIONS OF THE BIDENTATE-ANCHORED C8 LIGANDS RESULTED IN HINDERED ANALYTE ACCESS TO POTENTIAL ANP BINDING SITES ON THE BDC8 STATIONARY PHASE SURFACE.

DIPOLE MOMENT, GAS-PHASE BASICITY, BRNSTED BASICITY, AND SURFACE TENSION) HAVE BEEN DEBATED IN THE LITERATURE. WE REPORT A SERIES OF SOLUTION ADDITIVES FOR ESI-MS BASED ON CYCLIC ALKYL CARBONATES AND SULPHITES THAT HAVE ALKYL CHAINS THAT ARE FROM TWO TO TEN METHYLENE UNITS LONG. THE EXTENT OF CHARGING OF [VAL [5]]-ANGIOTENSIN II, CYTOCHROME C, CARBONIC ANHYDRASE II, AND BOVINE SERUM ALBUMIN IN ESI-MS USING THE ADDITIVES WAS MEASURED.

AT A CRITICAL ALKYL CHAIN LENGTH OF FOUR METHYLENE UNITS, PROTEIN ION CHARGE STATES DECREASED AS THE CHAIN LENGTH INCREASED. THE DIPOLE MOMENTS, GAS-PHASE BASICITY VALUES, AND BRNSTED BASICITIES (I.E.

OUR LIMITED PROTEOLYSIS AND THE CONSEQUENT ANALYSIS OF THE PROTEOLYTIC FRAGMENTS INDICATE THAT RCYP IS COMPOSED OF ONE DOMAIN WITH A SHORT FLEXIBLE TAIL AT THE C-TERMINAL END. WE ALSO SHOW THAT THE UREA-INDUCED UNFOLDING OF BOTH RCYP AND RCYP-CSA IS COMPLETELY REVERSIBLE AND PROCEEDS VIA THE SYNTHESIS OF AT LEAST ONE STABLE INTERMEDIATE. BOTH THE SECONDARY STRUCTURE AND THE TERTIARY STRUCTURE OF EACH INTERMEDIATE APPEARS VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE CORRESPONDING NATIVE PROTEIN.

MPN HAS BEEN DEFINED AS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATION-DRIVEN TUMOR MODEL. IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS A CLOSE LINK BETWEEN CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND MPN PATHOGENESIS. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED CYTOKINE PROFILES IN MPN PATIENTS. OTHER STUDIES HAVE USED CELL LINES OR ANIMAL MODELS AIMING TO CLARIFY THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM OF CYTOKINES IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF MPN. HOWEVER, IMPORTANT QUESTIONS REMAIN: (1) AMONG ALL THESE CYTOKINES, WHICH ARE MORE PREDICTIVE? AND (2) WHICH ARE MORE CRITICAL? IN THIS REVIEW, WE SUMMARIZE CYTOKINES THAT HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN MPN AND HIGHLIGHT SEVERAL CYTOKINES THAT MAY BE MORE SIGNIFICANT IN MPN. WE SUGGEST THAT CYTOKINES ARE MORE CRITICAL IN PMF THAN PV OR ET. THESE CYTOKINES INCLUDE IL-1, TNF-, IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, PDGF, IFNS AND TGF-, ALL OF WHICH SHOULD BE MORE CLOSELY INVESTIGATED IN MPN. BASED ON OUR EXTENSIVE LITERATURE SEARCH, SEVERAL KEY FACTORS HAVE EMERGED IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF MPN: FIRST, TNF- COULD CORRELATE WITH MPN PROGRESSION INCLUDING PMF, PV AND ET. IL-1 PLAYS A ROLE IN PMF PROGRESSION, WHILE IT SHOWED NO RELATION WITH PV OR ET. SECOND, IL-8 COULD BE A PROGNOSTIC FACTOR FOR PMF, AND IL-6 COULD BE IMPORTANT FOR MPN PROGRESSION. THIRD, VEGF AND PDGF PLAY AN INDIRECT ROLE IN MPN DEVELOPMENT AND THEIR INHIBITORS COULD BE EFFECTIVE. FOURTH, DIFFERENT SUBTYPES OF IFNS COULD HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS IN MPN. FINALLY, TGF- IS CLOSELY LINKED TO MF, ALTHOUGH THE DATA ARE INCONSISTENT. AGENTS THAT HAVE TARGETED THESE CYTOKINES DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE ALREADY IN CLINICAL TRIALS, AND SOME OF THEM HAVE EVEN BEEN USED TO TREAT MPN PATIENTS.

LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE IS USED TO VISUALIZE THE OXYGEN CONCENTRATION IN THE BUBBLE WAKE FROM WHICH THE GLOBAL MASS TRANSFER COEFFICIENT CAN BE CALCULATED.

GROWING NEEDS OF HOLISTIC ASSESSMENTS OF URBAN WATER SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED TO IDENTIFY SYSTEMS-LEVEL CROSS-DOMAIN SOLUTIONS. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF URBAN WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS WITH TWO UTILITIES IN GREATER CINCINNATI REGION AS A CASE STUDY. THE SCOPE OF THIS STUDY INCLUDES THE ENTIRE URBAN WATER AND WASTEWATER SYSTEMS STARTING FROM RAW WATER ACQUISITION FOR DRINKING WATER TO WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND DISCHARGE. THE DETAILED PROCESS-BASED LIFE CYCLE MODELS WERE DEVELOPED BASED ON THE DATASETS PROVIDED BY LOCAL WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITIES. THE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT INDICATED THAT THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF DRINKING WATER DISTRIBUTION WAS A DOMINATING CONTRIBUTOR FOR ENERGY CONSUMPTION (43%) AND GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL (41%). WASTEWATER DISCHARGE FROM THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT CONTRIBUTED TO MORE THAN 80% OF THE TOTAL EUTROPHICATION POTENTIAL. THE COST ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT LABOR AND MAINTENANCE COST (19%) FOR WASTEWATER COLLECTION, AND ELECTRICITY COST (13%) FOR DRINKING WATER DISTRIBUTION WERE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS. ELECTRICITY PURCHASED BY THE UTILITY WAS THE DRIVER FOR THE MAJORITY OF IMPACT CATEGORIES ASSESSED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EUTROPHICATION, BLUE WATER USE, AND METAL DEPLETION. INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS HAD A NEGLIGIBLE INFLUENCE ON IMPACT RESULTS, CONTRIBUTING LESS THAN 3% TO MOST CATEGORIES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF METAL DEPLETION WHERE IT LED TO 68% OF TOTAL BURDENS. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE LIFE CYCLE ENVIRONMENTAL RESULTS WERE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE CHOICE OF THE ELECTRICITY MIXES AND ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION THAN THE REST OF INPUT PARAMETERS SUCH AS CHEMICAL DOSAGES, AND INFRASTRUCTURE LIFE TIME.

WHILE PHYSICAL BARRIERS SUCH AS ULTRAFILTRATION MEMBRANES EFFECTIVELY PREVENT THE PASSAGE OF BACTERIA, AND CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL TREATMENTS CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE THE CARBON CONTENT OF THE TREATED WATER, THERE EXISTS A KNOWLEDGE GAP REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF ANTI-BACTERIAL STRATEGIES TO PREVENT THE GROWTH OF HARMFUL BACTERIA FOLLOWING TREATMENT. IN THIS STUDY, THE EFFLUENT WATER FROM A HOUSEHOLD-SCALE GREYWATER TREATMENT SYSTEM WAS FED TO SEVEN PARALLEL EXPERIMENTAL POST-TREATMENT TANKS: THREE RECEIVING DIRECT CHLORINATION WITH FREE CHLORINE RESIDUALS OF 0.2, 1 OR 5 MG CL2/L, THREE WITH CHLORINE PRODUCED THROUGH ELECTROLYSIS AT THE SAME RESIDUAL CONCENTRATIONS, AND ONE CONTROL WITH NO CHLORINE ADDED. FOR INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF DIRECT CHLORINATION, THE MEDIAN TOTAL CELL COUNT (TCC) VALUES WERE 9 104, 2.9 104 AND 1.8 103 CELLS/ML, RESPECTIVELY. ELECTROLYSIS TREATMENT PRODUCED VERY SIMILAR TCC CONCENTRATIONS, 8.8 104, 1.1 104 AND 2.3 103 CELLS/ML. THE TCC CONCENTRATIONS WERE LOWER THAN THE CONCENTRATION OF THE WATER ENTERING EACH TANK (3 105 CELLS/ML). INTACT CELL COUNT (ICC) MEASUREMENTS INDICATED THAT THE VIABLE CELL CONCENTRATIONS, WERE LESS THAN 10% OF THE TCC VALUES. THOUGH ELECTROLYSIS TREATMENT CAN PRODUCE POWERFUL OXIDANTS, SUCH AS HYDROXYL RADICAL, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT ELECTROLYSIS IN THIS SYSTEM PROVIDED ADDITIONAL BENEFITS BEYOND CHLORINE PRODUCTION FOR CONTROL OF TOTAL OR INTACT CELL COUNTS. OXIDATION OF BACTERIA BY CHLORINE WAS THE DOMINANT ANTI-BACTERIAL MECHANISM IN OUR SYSTEM. MONITORING OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON (DOC) AND ASSIMILABLE ORGANIC CARBON (AOC) DID NOT SUGGEST THAT CARBON-LIMITATION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED CELL COUNTS WHEN CHLORINATION OR ELECTROLYSIS TREATMENT WAS APPLIED.

WE RECOMMEND SELECTING CHLORINE RESIDUAL TARGETS SUCH THAT A CHLORINE RESIDUAL IS MAINTAINED DURING PERIODS OF CHALLENGING OPERATING CONDITIONS.

THE CHALLENGES FACING URBAN WATER SYSTEMS CAN NO LONGER BE SUSTAINABLY SOLVED BY TRADITIONAL SILOED WATER MANAGEMENT APPROACHES. A CENTRAL PREMISE OF CONTEMPORARY URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT PARADIGMS IS THAT IN ORDER FOR URBAN WATER SYSTEMS TO BE MORE SUSTAINABLE AND ECONOMICAL, AN IMPROVEMENT IN RESOURCE USE EFFICIENCY AT SYSTEM LEVEL MUST BE ACHIEVED. THIS STUDY PROVIDES A QUANTIFICATION OF THE TOTAL RESOURCE USE OF A TYPICAL URBAN WATER SYSTEM EXEMPLIFIED IN GREATER CINCINNATI REGION FROM RAW WATER EXTRACTION FOR DRINKING WATER TO WASTEWATER TREATMENT AND DISCHARGE, PROVIDING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF RESOURCE EXPENDITURE DISTRIBUTIONS WITHIN THE SYSTEM AND A NECESSARY BENCHMARK TO WHICH FUTURE SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE COMPARED. THE EMERGY METHODOLOGY WAS USED SO THAT THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENTAL WORK REQUIRED TO PRODUCE DISPARATE SYSTEM INPUTS COULD BE EXPRESSED USING A COMMON UNIT. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED TO THE CONCURRING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) AND LIFE CYCLE COSTING (LCC) RESULTS OF THE SAME SYSTEM. EMERGY RESULTS HIGHLIGHT DRINKING WATER TREATMENT AND DRINKING WATER DISTRIBUTION AS TWO RESOURCE-INTENSIVE STAGES, WITH ENERGY FOR PUMPING AND CHEMICALS FOR CONDITIONING REPRESENTING THE GREATEST INPUTS TO THE FORMER AND ENERGY FOR PUMPING AND METALS FOR PIPING REPRESENTING THE GREATEST INPUTS TO THE LATTER. FOR WASTEWATER COLLECTION AND TREATMENT STAGES, AERATION AND SLUDGE HANDLING WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE HIGHEST EMERGY UNIT PROCESSES, MOSTLY DUE TO ENERGY USE. COMPARISON WITH LCA RESULTS SUBSTANTIATE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY USE IN THE DRINKING WATER TREATMENT AND DISTRIBUTION STAGES BUT INDICATE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL BURDENS ASSOCIATED WITH INFRASTRUCTURE ARE MORE DEPENDENT UPON UPSTREAM RESOURCE USE RATHER THAN DOWNSTREAM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.

THE CULTURABLE FECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA (FIB) WERE USED TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT HOUSEHOLD WATER STORAGE CONDITIONS (E.G., TYPE OF CONTAINER AND OPEN VS. CLOSED CONTAINER) AND INTERVENTIONS (E.G., WATER STORAGE DAYS, CLEANED ON THE LAST DAY OF USE, AND HYGIENE PRACTICES). ONLY THE AMOUNT OF DAYS THE WATER WAS STORED SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERED (P-VALUE < 0.05), WHICH SHOWED THAT POTENTIAL HEALTH RISKS INCREASED WHEN WATER WAS STORED FOR MORE THAN 3 DAYS. THE HIGHER ABUNDANCE OF MOLECULAR FIB IN BIOFILM THAN HOUSEHOLD WATER SUGGESTED THAT OMNIPRESENT BIOFILM IN HOUSEHOLD WATER COULD POTENTIAL HEALTH RISK. THE HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING REVEALED THAT THE MOST ABUNDANT PHYLUM WAS PROTEOBACTERIA, FOLLOWED BY ACTINOBACTERIA AND BACTEROIDETES IN BOTH THE WATER AND THE BIOFILM SAMPLES. BACTERIAL GENERA SEEN IN BIOFILM BACTERIA, SUCH AS PSEUDOMONAS, ACINETOBACTER AND COMAMONAS. ACINETOBACTER, CHRYSEOBACTERIUM, STENOTROPHOMONAS AND CORYNEBACTERIUM, WERE RELATIVELY MORE ABUNDANT IN THE BIOFILM THAN IN THE WATER. POTENTIAL BACTERIAL PATHOGENS INCLUDING ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII, CITROBACTER FREUNDII, STENOTROPHOMONAS MALTOPHILIA AND HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZA, WERE DETECTED IN HOUSEHOLD WATER AND BIOFILM. THE MICROBIAL QUALITY MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY WATER-STORAGE TIME AND HOUSEHOLDS REPEATEDLY USING THE SAME WATER STORAGE CONTAINERS WITHOUT PROPER SANITIZATION, TRIGGERING MICROBIAL REGROWTH AND BIOFILM FORMATION ON WATER CONTAINERS. HIGHER BACTERIAL DIVERSITY AND POTENTIALLY PATHOGENIC BACTERIA FOUND IN THE BIOFILM SAMPLES OF A HOUSEHOLD WATER SUPPLY ARE UNHEALTHY FOR THE HOUSE'S INHABITANTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT PREVENTING THE FORMATION OF THESE DANGEROUS BIOFILMS IN A COMMUNAL WATER SUPPLY. 2019 THE AUTHORS","BIOFILM; DEVELOPING COUNTRY; DRINKING WATER; HOUSEHOLD WATER; METAGENOMICS","BACTERIA; BIOFILMS; CONTAINERS; DEVELOPING COUNTRIES; HEALTH; HEALTH RISKS; POTABLE WATER; RISK ASSESSMENT; WATER POLLUTION; WATER QUALITY; WATER SUPPLY; FECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA; HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZA; HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING; HOUSEHOLD WATER; METAGENOMICS; MICROBIAL WATER QUALITY; POTENTIAL HEALTH RISKS; STENOTROPHOMONAS MALTOPHILIA; RURAL AREAS; DRINKING WATER; RNA 16S; TAP WATER; ABUNDANCE; BACTERIUM; BIOFILM; DEVELOPING WORLD; DRINKING WATER; GENOMICS; HEALTH RISK; REGROWTH; RURAL AREA; WATER QUALITY; WATER STORAGE; WATER SUPPLY; ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII; ACTINOBACTERIA; ALPHA HEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCUS; ARTICLE; BACTEROIDETES; CHRYSEOBACTERIUM; CITROBACTER FREUNDII; COLIFORM BACTERIUM; COMAMONAS; CONTROLLED STUDY; CORYNEBACTERIUM; DEVELOPING COUNTRY; GENE SEQUENCE; HAEMOPHILUS; HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE; HEALTH HAZARD; HIGH THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING; HOUSEHOLD; METAGENOMICS; MICROBIAL COMMUNITY; MICROBIAL DIVERSITY; NONHUMAN; PHYLUM; PRIORITY JOURNAL; PROTEOBACTERIA; PSEUDOMONAS; PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA; STAPHYLOCOCCUS EPIDERMIDIS; STENOTROPHOMONAS; STENOTROPHOMONAS MALTOPHILIA; WATER QUALITY; WATER SUPPLY; CAMEROON; ACINETOBACTER; ACINETOBACTER BAUMANNII; ACTINOBACTERIA; BACTERIA (MICROORGANISMS); BACTEROIDETES; CHRYSEOBACTERIUM; CITROBACTER FREUNDII; COMAMONAS; CORYNEBACTERIUM; HAEMOPHILUS INFLUENZAE; PROTEOBACTERIA; PSEUDOMONAS; STENOTROPHOMONAS; STENOTROPHOMONAS MALTOPHILIA","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF SINGAPORE, 1 ENGINEERING DRIVE 2, SINGAPORE, 117576, SINGAPORE; DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL, ARCHITECTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING, THE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN, 301E.

TO RETAIN ITS INFERENTIAL POWER, USER-INTRODUCED TECHNICAL VARIABILITY MUST BE REDUCED AND ACCOUNTED FOR. SELECTING A SET OF STABLY EXPRESSED INTERNAL CONTROL GENES (ICG), VALIDATED FOR EACH EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION/SAMPLE SET, IS WIDELY ACCEPTED AS A RELIABLE WAY TO NORMALIZE RT-QPCR DATA AND ACCOUNT FOR SAID VARIABILITY. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS IN ESTABLISHING STANDARDIZED AND RESOURCE-EFFICIENT NORMALIZATION APPROACHES, NUMEROUS RECENT REPORTS HAVE UNDERLINED DEFICIENCIES IN THE STATE OF RT-QPCR NORMALIZATION. LIVESTOCK SCIENCE HAS BENEFITTED TREMENDOUSLY FROM THE USE OF RT-QPCR, HOWEVER, THE ISSUE OF LACK OF PROPER NORMALIZATION LIKELY AFFECTS THIS DISCIPLINE AS WELL. WE THUS DECIDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS TRUE, AND TO WHICH EXTENT. WE CONDUCTED AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF ALL (225) RT-QPCR ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN THE SIX MOST PROMINENT LIVESTOCK JOURNALS IN THE FIELD FROM 2013 TO 2017. A QUANTITATIVE SCALE WAS CONSTRUCTED, AND VALUES WERE ASSIGNED TO EACH ARTICLE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF ICG USED, THE USE OF A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ALGORITHM TO ASSESS THE RELIABILITY OF ICG, AND THE REPORTING OF PERTINENT INFORMATION RELATED TO ICG (RANGES FROM 0=TOTAL NONCOMPLIANCE - TO 100=TOTAL COMPLIANCE). OUT OF THE SURVEYED GROUP, ONLY 10.7% OF THE PUBLICATIONS OBTAINED A SCORE OF 100, WHILE THE LARGEST GROUP (N=158) WAS REPRESENTED BY ARTICLES THAT SCORED 0. SUBDIVIDING ARTICLES BASED ON WHETHER AN ALGORITHM TO VALIDATE ICG WAS USED (YAL) OR NOT (NAL) REVEALED THE USE OF A LARGER NUMBER OF ICG TO NORMALIZE RT-QPCR IN THE YAL GROUP COMPARED TO NAL (1.4-FOLD MORE, 95% C.I.: 1.111.84) AND WAS CLOSER TO THE GOLD STANDARD OF THREE ICG. USING AN ALGORITHM ALSO INCREASED THE DIVERSITY OF ICG AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE USE OF RNA18S, WHOSE SUITABILITY AS ICG HAS BEEN THOROUGHLY DEBATED.

THE ANALYSIS IS CONDUCTED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS BY USING THE MEASURED ENERGY CONSUMPTIONS AND LOADS FOR AN EXISTING SYSTEM WITH R404A. EXCEPT FOR THE REFRIGERATION SYSTEM COMPARISON, A MODEL FOR THE PREDICTION OF THE HOURLY REFRIGERATION LOADS OF THE EXISTING SUPERMARKET IS DEVELOPED USING EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS. THIS MODEL IS APPLIED FOR THE YEARLY EVALUATION OF THE PROPOSED CO2 REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS. THE EXAMINED CO2 SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS INCLUDE A SIMPLE BOOSTER SYSTEM, A SYSTEM WITH PARALLEL COMPRESSION, A SYSTEM WITH PARALLEL COMPRESSION AND OVERFED EVAPORATORS IN THE MEDIUM TEMPERATURE, A SYSTEM WITH PARALLEL COMPRESSION AND OVERFED EVAPORATORS IN BOTH MEDIUM AND LOW TEMPERATURE, A SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THE LAST ONE WITH THE ADDITION OF AN INTERCOOLER AFTER THE LOW TEMPERATURE COMPRESSORS, AND ALL THE AFOREMENTIONED SYSTEMS WITH THE ADDITION OF A MECHANICAL SUBCOOLING CYCLE AFTER THE GAS COOLER. ACCORDING TO THE FINAL RESULTS, THE MOST PROMISING CONFIGURATION IS THE ONE WITH PARALLEL COMPRESSION, OVERFED EVAPORATORS IN MEDIUM AND LOW TEMPERATURE, INTERCOOLER AND MECHANICAL SUBCOOLING, WHICH LEADS TO 8.53% YEARLY ELECTRICITY SAVINGS COMPARED TO THE CONVENTIONAL R404A SYSTEM. MOREOVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO STATE THAT THE SIMPLE BOOSTER CO2 SYSTEM IS FOUND TO BE LESS EFFICIENT THAN THE CONVENTIONAL R404A SYSTEM WITH 15.23% HIGHER YEARLY ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION. 2019","CO2 REFRIGERANT; COP; LOAD PREDICTION; PERFORMANCE COMPARISON; SUPERMARKET REFRIGERATION","CARBON DIOXIDE; EVAPORATORS; FLUOROCARBONS; LAWS AND LEGISLATION; REFRIGERANTS; RETAIL STORES; TEMPERATURE; CO2 REFRIGERANT; CONVENTIONAL SYSTEMS; ELECTRICITY-CONSUMPTION; LOAD PREDICTIONS; PERFORMANCE COMPARISON; REFRIGERATION SYSTEM; SUPERMARKET REFRIGERATION; SYSTEM CONFIGURATIONS; REFRIGERATION","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",2,"THERMAL DEPARTMENT, SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS, ATHENS, GREECE; ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT, HEAD DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENT, METRO S.A, ATHENS, GREECE","10.1016/J.ECMX.2019.100006","100006","BELLOS, E., THERMAL DEPARTMENT, SCHOOL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENSGREECE, EMAIL: BELLOSECENTRAL.NTUA.GR",NA,NA,"25901745",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","1",2019,"none","NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS;ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT","NATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENSGREECE",NA,"MITSOPOULOS G, 2019, ENERGY CONVERS MANAGE X","MITSOPOULOS G, 2019, ENERGY CONVERS MANAGE X"

HOWEVER, AT THE SAME TIME INTRINSIC BRITTLENESS HAS BEEN THEIR MAIN DRAWBACK, WHICH SEVERELY RESTRICTS MANY APPLICATIONS. DESPITE MUCH PROGRESS, A BREAKTHROUGH IN DEVELOPING ULTRA-DAMAGE-RESISTANT AND DUCTILE OXIDE GLASSES STILL NEEDS TO BE MADE. HERE, A CRITICAL ADVANCEMENT TOWARD SUCH OXIDE GLASSES IS PRESENTED. IN DETAIL, A BULK OXIDE GLASS WITH A RECORD-HIGH CRACK RESISTANCE IS OBTAINED BY SUBJECTING A CAESIUM ALUMINOBORATE GLASS TO SURFACE AGING UNDER HUMID CONDITIONS, ENABLING IT TO SUSTAIN SHARP CONTACT DEFORMATIONS UNDER LOADS OF 500 N WITHOUT FORMING ANY STRENGTH-LIMITING CRACKS. THIS ULTRA-HIGH CRACK RESISTANCE EXCEEDS THAT OF THE ANNEALED OXIDE GLASSES BY MORE THAN ONE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, MAKING THIS GLASS MICRO-DUCTILE. IN ADDITION, A REMARKABLE INDENTATION BEHAVIOR, I.E., A TIME-DEPENDENT SHRINKAGE OF THE INDENT CAVITY, IS DEMONSTRATED.

WE EVALUATED THE CONTRACEPTIVE EFFICACY DURING THE THIRD, FOURTH AND FIFTH YEAR, AND ASSESSED ADDITIONAL PHARMACOKINETICS (PK), SAFETY, AND ACCEPTABILITY ENDPOINTS. STUDY DESIGN: WE ENROLLED A COHORT OF 255 CURRENT SINO-IMPLANT (II) USERS ENTERING THEIR THIRD YEAR AND A SECOND COHORT OF 243 USERS ENTERING THEIR FOURTH YEAR. WE FOLLOWED THESE TWO COHORTS FOR 12 AND 24 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. TO CHARACTERIZE PK ENDPOINTS (I.E. LEVONORGESTREL (LNG), SEX HORMONE BINDING GLOBULIN AND FREE LNG INDEX) OVER 5 YEARS, WE COLLECTED BLOOD SAMPLES IN A SUBSET OF 50 PARTICIPANTS WE FOLLOWED DURING THE THIRD, FOURTH AND FIFTH YEAR. WE ALSO ENROLLED SMALL COHORTS (N=20) OF SINO-IMPLANT (II) USERS ENTERING THEIR SIXTH MONTH AND SECOND YEAR AND FOLLOWED THEM EACH FOR UP TO 6 MONTHS. OUR PRIMARY EFFICACY MEASURES WERE THE PREGNANCY PEARL INDICES DURING YEAR 3 AND 4. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES INCLUDED ASSESSMENTS OF PK, SAFETY, ACCEPTABILITY AND EFFICACY IN THE FIFTH YEAR.

HERE, WE CONDUCTED A LONG-TERM MESOCOSM EXPERIMENT WHERE THE EFFECTS OF PLANTS AND HYDROLOGIC CONDITIONS ON THE DISSIPATION AND DEGRADATION OF UR AND SRB WAS SEPARATELY INVESTIGATED. MASS BALANCES WERE COMBINED WITH EXCITATION EMISSION MATRIX (EEM) FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY TO CHARACTERIZE MICROBIALLY-DERIVED ORGANIC MATTER. RESULTS REVEALED THAT MOST OF SRB ACCUMULATED IN THE SAND WHILE UR WAS MAINLY FOUND IN THE PORE WATER. THE ESTIMATED DEGRADATION OF UR AND SRB WAS GREATER IN THE TREATMENTS WITH PLANTS AND UNDER UNSATURATED CONDITIONS. OVERALL, UR EXHIBITED HIGHER PRESUMABLE DEGRADATION THAN SRB. TWO COMPONENTS WERE IDENTIFIED BY PARALLEL FACTOR ANALYSIS OF THE EEMS IN ADDITION TO THE UR-RELATED COMPONENT (U), ONE HUMIC-LIKE OF HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM TERRESTRIAL OR SOIL ORGANIC MATTER SOURCES (A + C) AND A SECOND HUMIC-LIKE OF LOWER MOLECULAR WEIGHT RELATED TO RECENT MICROBIAL ACTIVITY (M). A HIGH POSITIVE CORRELATION (SPEARMAN'S RHO=0.74, P < 0.001) BETWEEN M AND U SUGGESTED A POSSIBLE LINK, IN WHICH THE PRESENCE OF UR FOSTERED MICROBIAL PROCESSES, THUS SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS OF BIODEGRADATION OF UR, WHICH SEEMED INDEPENDENT OF THE PRESENCE OF PLANTS, WHEREAS IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO POINT OUT SUCH A CORRELATION FOR SRB.

WE PRESENT A DAILY VARIATION OF LONG-TERM (20122015) RECORD OF RAIN ISOTOPE FROM PORT BLAIR TO UNDERSTAND THE MOISTURE DYNAMICS ON A SUB-SEASONAL TIMESCALE. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE PORT BLAIR RAINWATER OXYGEN ISOTOPE RATIOS (18O) MAINTAIN A TEMPORALLY DEPENDENT CORRELATION WITH THE AVERAGE RAINFALL OVER THE CORE MONSOON ZONE (CMZ) OF INDIA, THOUGH THE SEASONAL RAINFALL OVER THESE TWO REGIONS APPEARS TO BE MUTUALLY INDEPENDENT.

METHODS: WE ANALYZED DATA FROM A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF SEXUALLY ACTIVE WOMEN IN HANOI, VIETNAM, NOT DESIRING PREGNANCY. WE USED LINEAR AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO EVALUATE CONTRACEPTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF USERS OF THE INTRAUTERINE DEVICE (IUD), COMBINATION ORAL CONTRACEPTION (COC) AND MALE CONDOMS. WE MEASURED CONTRACEPTIVE KNOWLEDGE WITH SEVEN QUESTIONS ON RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF METHODS, REVERSIBILITY, COVERT USE, CONTRAINDICATIONS AND SIDE EFFECTS. RESULTS: RESPONDENTS USED IUD (N=128), COC (N=126) OR CONDOMS (N=167). SUMMARY KNOWLEDGE SCORES DID NOT DIFFER BY CURRENT TYPE OF METHOD USED. ONLY ONE KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN, CONTRACEPTIVE EFFECTIVENESS, VARIED BY METHOD. COMPARED TO CONDOM USERS, IUD USERS HAD HIGHER ODDS OF CORRECTLY IDENTIFYING THE IUD AS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN COC, CONDOMS AND WITHDRAWAL (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO [AOR], 4.8, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 2.78.3). HIGHER PROPORTIONS OF CONDOM USERS (49.7%) MISTAKENLY IDENTIFIED CONDOMS AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE OF LISTED METHODS COMPARED TO IUD (20.3%) AND COC USERS (23.0%). ON THE OTHER HAND, IUD AND COC USERS HAD LOWER ODDS (AOR, 0.5, 95% CI, 0.21.0 AND AOR, 0.3, 95% CI, 0.10.6, RESPECTIVELY) OF IDENTIFYING CONSISTENT CONDOM USE AS BETTER FOR PREGNANCY PREVENTION THAN OTHER PRACTICES (E.G., WITHDRAWAL AND POSTCOITAL DOUCHING). CONCLUSIONS: IUD USERS MORE OFTEN RECOGNIZED THAT THE IUD IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE WHILE CONDOM USERS APPEARED TO OVERESTIMATE CONDOM EFFECTIVENESS. CONTRACEPTIVE COUNSELING SHOULD ENSURE THAT WOMEN UNDERSTAND THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF METHODS. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE THAT OTHER TYPES OF CONTRACEPTIVE KNOWLEDGE DIFFERED BY TYPE OF METHOD USED.

X","OBJECTIVES: IN APPROXIMATELY 15% OF CASES OF SPONTANEOUS SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE (SAH), AN OBVIOUS SOURCE OF BLEEDING CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED BY ANGIOGRAPHY, THESE ARE CONSIDERED CASES OF SAH OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY. A RARE CASE OF CISTERNAL PILOCYTIC ASTROCYTOMA (PA) PRESENTING WITH SAH IS REPORTED. THE USEFULNESS OF THE BALANCED STEADY-STATE FREE PRECESSION (BSSFP) SEQUENCE FOR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) TO DETECT SMALL CISTERNAL LESIONS IS DISCUSSED. CASE DESCRIPTION: THE CASE OF A 73-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO DEVELOPED REPEATED SAHS OWING TO A CISTERNAL PA IS PRESENTED. SHE EXPERIENCED SUDDEN ONSET OF HEADACHE AND VOMITING, AND BRAIN COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SHOWED DIFFUSE SAH, WHEREAS ANGIOGRAPHY DEMONSTRATED NORMAL VASCULATURE. FOLLOW-UP IMAGING, INCLUDING T1-WEIGHTED, T2-WEIGHTED, T1-WEIGHTED CONTRAST-ENHANCED, AND DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED MRI, DID NOT SHOW ANY PARENCHYMAL OR CISTERNAL LESIONS, ALTHOUGH COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY AND FLUID-ATTENUATED INVERSION RECOVERY MRI SHOWED SAH IN THE SAME REGION.

STUDY DESIGN: PROGRAM DIRECTORS FROM ALL IDENTIFIED PRIMARY CARE TRAINING PROGRAMS (N=51) WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ONLINE SURVEY TO ASSESS THE SRH DIDACTIC AND CLINICAL OFFERINGS BASED ON COMPETENCIES DEVELOPED BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND ADAPTED FOR THE US ACROSS 15 DOMAINS AND 15 RELATED PROCEDURES. RESULTS: TWENTY-TWO (43%) SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED. THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE VARIATION IN OFFERINGS, WITH NO SINGLE DOMAIN REQUIRED BY ALL PROGRAMS, NOR ANY PROGRAM REQUIRING TRAINEES TO COMPLETE DIDACTIC AND CLINICAL OFFERINGS IN ALL DOMAINS. ON AVERAGE, PROGRAMS REQUIRED DIDACTIC AND CLINICAL TRAINING FOR APPROXIMATELY A THIRD OF THE COMPETENCIES IN THE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT CANCERS DOMAIN (THE MOST REQUIRED DOMAIN) AND FOR APPROXIMATELY A QUARTER OF THE COMPETENCIES IN THE CONTRACEPTIVE DOMAIN. INFERTILITY/FERTILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH WERE THE LEAST COMMONLY REQUIRED DOMAINS.

STUDY DESIGN: WE ANALYZED A SAMPLE OF 1096 HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES (AGED 1826) FROM THE NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF ADOLESCENT TO ADULT HEALTH ROMANTIC PAIR SUBSAMPLE. WE COMPARED MALE AND FEMALE PARTNER REPORTS OF HORMONAL/LONG-ACTING METHOD USE USING CLASS OF METHOD (HORMONAL/LONG-ACTING) RATHER THAN TYPE (E.G., INTRAUTERINE DEVICE). REGRESSION ANALYSES LINKED MEN'S REPORTS OF INDIVIDUAL AND RELATIONSHIP CHARACTERISTICS WITH ALIGNMENT OF REPORTING. RESULTS: SIXTEEN PERCENT OF YOUNG MEN REPORTED HORMONAL/LONG-ACTING METHOD USE AT LAST SEX DIFFERENTLY THAN THEIR FEMALE PARTNER, THAT IS, HAD A MISMATCHED REPORT. MEN WHO HAD FEWER LIFETIME SEXUAL PARTNERS, HAD GREATER RELATIONSHIP SATISFACTION, BELIEVED THEIR PARTNER WAS MONOGAMOUS AND HAD A MATCHED REPORT OF CONDOM USE AT LAST SEX WERE MORE LIKELY TO MATCH THEIR PARTNER'S REPORT OF HORMONAL/LONG-ACTING CONTRACEPTIVE USE. MEN LIVING WITH CHILDREN (FROM EITHER PARTNER) WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A MATCHED REPORT. HISPANIC MEN WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A MATCHED REPORT THAN BLACK MEN. CONCLUSIONS: MEN ARE AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PART OF PREGNANCY PREVENTION EFFORTS. PREGNANCY PREVENTION AND HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP PROGRAMS THAT INCORPORATE COMMUNICATION SKILLS MAY ALSO INDIRECTLY IMPROVE YOUNG MEN'S KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR PARTNER'S CONTRACEPTIVE USE AND ENGAGEMENT IN CONTRACEPTIVE DECISION MAKING. IMPLICATIONS: ANALYSES SHOWED THAT NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE 16% OF YOUNG MEN THAT DID NOT ACCURATELY REPORT THEIR PARTNER'S HORMONAL/LONG-ACTING METHOD USE AT LAST SEX UNDERREPORT METHOD USE.

X","BACKGROUND: HEMIFACIAL SPASM (HFS) IS A BENIGN DISEASE CAUSED BY THE HYPER EXCITEMENT OF FACIAL NERVES OWING TO VESSEL COMPRESSION. THE OFFENDING VESSELS ARE USUALLY ARTERIES, SUCH AS ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR INFERIOR CEREBELLAR OR VERTEBRAL ARTERIES, BUT THERE ARE FEW REPORTS OF VEIN INVOLVEMENT CASES. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE VEINS AS OFFENDING VESSELS IN PATIENTS WITH HFS CONFIRMED BY ABNORMAL MUSCLE RESPONSE (AMR). METHODS: WE ANALYZED 5 PATIENTS WITH HFS CAUSED BY VEINS AMONG 78 PATIENTS WITH HFS OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS. ALL PATIENTS UNDERWENT MICROVASCULAR DECOMPRESSION (MVD) WITH AMR MONITORING, WHEREAS 3 OF THEM UNDERWENT A SECOND MVD. THE MEAN FOLLOW-UP TIME WAS 97 MONTHS. RESULTS: ARTERIES WERE THOROUGHLY DECOMPRESSED IN 3 PATIENTS WITH A FAILED FIRST MVD SURGERY WHO RECEIVED A SECOND SURGERY, DURING WHICH VEINS AT THE ROOT EXIT POINT (REXP) WERE DECOMPRESSED WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OR A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE AMPLITUDE OF AMR. TWO PATIENTS SHOWED SPASM RESOLUTION AFTER THE FIRST SURGERY WHEN VEINS WERE DECOMPRESSED TOGETHER WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE OF AMR. THE LOCATION OF VEINS WAS REXP AND THE CISTERNAL PORTION. ALL PATIENTS HAD EXCELLENT OUTCOMES WITHIN 3 MONTHS, AND NO COMPLICATIONS WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: VEINS CAN BE OFFENDING VESSELS IN HFS PATIENTS. AMR IS USEFUL TO DETERMINE THE ENDPOINT IN THESE CASES. ONCE ARTERIES ARE DECOMPRESSED THOROUGHLY WITH RESIDUAL AMR, SURROUNDING VEINS AT UNUSUAL SITES, SUCH AS THE REXP OR THE CISTERNAL PORTION, MUST BE CHECKED TO PREVENT PERSISTENT HFS.

ENVIRON. X","AMBIENT POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS IN PARIS, FRANCE ARE ROUTINELY MEASURED BY THE LOCAL SURFACE-MONITOR NETWORK OF THE AIRPARIF AGENCY. SUCH NETWORKS, HOWEVER DENSE, HAVE A LIMITED SPATIAL REPRESENTATIVENESS AROUND THE MONITORING-SITE AND ARE NOT CAPABLE TO REPRESENT THE STRONG HORIZONTAL GRADIENTS OF POLLUTANT CONCENTRATIONS OVER URBAN AREAS. HIGH RESOLUTION MODELS SIMULATE 3D POLLUTANT CONCENTRATION FIELDS AT A SPATIAL RESOLUTION AS FINE AS A FEW METERS OVER THE URBAN AREA BY INTEGRATING THE UNDERLYING EMISSION SOURCES AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE EFFECT OF BUILDINGS ON THE DISPERSION PATTERNS. THESE MODELS, PROVIDE A GOOD SPATIAL VARIABILITY OVER THE URBAN AREA BUT SUFFER FROM UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THE EMISSION INVENTORIES, METEOROLOGICAL FIELDS AND PARAMETRIZATIONS OF THE PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL PROCESSES. IN THIS PAPER, SIMULATIONS CONDUCTED BY ARIA TECHNOLOGIES WITH THE PARALLEL MICRO-SWIFT-SPRAY (PMSS) MODEL (HTTPS://URLDEFENSE.PROOFPOINT.COM/V2/URL?U=HTTP-3A__WWW.ARIA.FR_PROJETS_AIRCITY&D=DWIGAQ&C=SJ6XIWYX-ZLMB3EPKVCNVG&R=HPRQO-QHQXHD8P9F43MEZW&M=5YGBN-CHJRK5Z0UQS3LYMJWATJDFIN15CLNA7HNK9FC&S=JX7ZKQF9SKD9YCMU0BYKNKOFA3BOONIIMNYA6AJTZPG&E= ) ARE USED TO ASSESS NOX AND PM10 REPRESENTATIVENESS AREAS AROUND FIVE URBAN BACKGROUND AND FIVE TRAFFIC-ORIENTED MONITORING-SITES OF THE AIRPARIF NETWORK DURING TEN DAYS IN MARCH 2016. COMMONLY, THE SPATIAL REPRESENTATIVENESS OF A MONITOR SITE IS DEFINED THROUGH HOMOGENEITY AREAS, NAMELY THE AREA AROUND A MONITORING-SITE WHERE POLLUTANT CONCENTRATION IS ABOVE 20% OF THE CONCENTRATION AT THE LOCATION OF THE MONITORING-SITE. HERE, WE PROPOSE A NOVEL APPROACH THAT USES SIMILARITY AREAS TO DEFINE THE SPATIAL REPRESENTATION OF MONITOR SITES. SIMILARITY AREAS INTEGRATE POINTS THAT RESPECT THE ADDITIONAL CONDITION TO BE HIGHLY CORRELATED IN TIME WITH THE CONCENTRATION AT THE MONITOR STATION. THUS, THE CRITERION TO SELECT SIMILARITY AREAS IS A COMBINATION OF A HIGH VALUE OF THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT AND A SMALL VALUE OF THE NORMALIZED ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERROR WITH REGARDS TO THE CONCENTRATION AT THE GRID-CELL CORRESPONDING TO THE LOCATION OF THE MONITOR. CRITERIA THRESHOLDS ARE DETERMINED THROUGH AN ITERATIVE ANALYSIS AND A REPRESENTATIVE AREA IS DEFINED THROUGH IMAGE PROCESSING THAT SELECTS ALL THE CONNECTED PIXELS THAT SATISFY CRITERIA THRESHOLDS AND INCORPORATE THE GRID-CELL OF THE MONITOR. DAILY SIMILARITY AREAS ESTIMATED AROUND EACH MONITOR ARE COMPARED AGAINST HOMOGENEITY AREAS WITH REGARDS TO THEIR SHAPE, SPATIAL EXTENT, AND URBAN SPECIFIC CHARACTERIZATION. AROUND URBAN BACKGROUND SITES THEY ARE OF THE SAME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, WHEREAS AROUND TRAFFIC SITES SIMILARITY AREAS ARE GENERALLY LARGER THAN HOMOGENEITY AREAS. PM10 REPRESENTATIVENESS AREAS ARE FOUND TO BE 2.2 TIMES LARGER THAN THE NOX ONES. URBAN BACKGROUND AREAS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BROAD NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND THE MONITORING-SITE, WHEREAS TRAFFIC-ORIENTED MONITORING-SITES ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF SPECIFIC URBAN FEATURES SUCH AS SECTIONS OF ROADS AND SIDEWALKS ALONG THE ROAD. AVERAGED OVER THE 10 DAYS OF THE STUDY AND ACROSS ALL MONITORING-SITES, REPRESENTATIVENESS AREAS FOR URBAN BACKGROUND MONITORING-SITES ARE ABOUT 8 TIMES LARGER THAN TRAFFIC REPRESENTATIVENESS AREAS (0.6 KM2 VS. 0.07 KM2). 2019 THE AUTHORS","HIGH RESOLUTION MODELING; SPATIAL REPRESENTATIVENESS; SURFACE MONITORING NETWORKS; URBAN AIR POLLUTION","AIR POLLUTION; IMAGE PROCESSING; MEAN SQUARE ERROR; MONITORING; POLLUTION DETECTION; CORRELATION COEFFICIENT; HIGH-RESOLUTION MODELS; POLLUTANT CONCENTRATION; ROOT MEAN SQUARE ERRORS; SPATIAL REPRESENTATIONS; SPATIAL REPRESENTATIVENESS; SURFACE MONITORING; URBAN AIR POLLUTION; URBAN GROWTH; AMBIENT AIR; ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION; BACKGROUND LEVEL; CONCENTRATION (COMPOSITION); IMAGE PROCESSING; NITROGEN OXIDES; NUMERICAL MODEL; PARTICULATE MATTER; POLLUTANT SOURCE; POLLUTION MONITORING; SPATIAL ANALYSIS; URBAN POLLUTION; AEROSOL; AIR POLLUTION; ARTICLE; CHEMICAL REACTION; CORRELATION COEFFICIENT; FRANCE; GRID CELL; HUMAN; HUMAN CELL; IMAGE PROCESSING; MONITORING; NEIGHBORHOOD; POLLUTANT; SIMULATION; UNCERTAINTY; URBAN AREA; FRANCE; ILE DE FRANCE; PARIS; VILLE DE PARIS","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",1,"LATMOS/IPSL, SORBONNE UNIVERSIT, UVSQ, CNRS, PARIS, FRANCE; LMD, ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE, PALAISEAU, FRANCE","10.1016/J.AEAOA.2019.100010","100010","RODRIGUEZ, D., LATMOS/IPSL, SORBONNE UNIVERSIT, UVSQ, CNRSFRANCE, EMAIL: DELPHY.RODRIGUEZLATMOS.IPSL.FR",NA,NA,"25901621",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","1",2019,"none","SORBONNE UNIVERSIT;ECOLE POLYTECHNIQUE","SORBONNE UNIVERSIT",NA,"RODRIGUEZ D, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X","RODRIGUEZ D, 2019, ATMOS ENVIRON X-a"

THESE RESTORATION MEASURES HAVE POTENTIAL TO ALTER STORMFLOW RESPONSES AND CONTRIBUTE TO NATURAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT, BUT THEIR IMPACTS ON STORM HYDROGRAPHS ARE POORLY QUANTIFIED. THIS PAPER REPORTS A BEFORE-AFTER-CONTROL-INTERVENTION (BACI) STUDY FROM THREE EXPERIMENTAL HEADWATER MICRO-CATCHMENTS IN THE SOUTH PENNINES (UK) REPRESENTING THE FIRST RIGOROUS EXPERIMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF BLANKET PEAT RESTORATION ON CATCHMENT RUNOFF. WE EVALUATE THE HYDROLOGICAL IMPACTS OF TWO STANDARD RESTORATION INTERVENTIONS, REVEGETATION OF BARE PEAT, AND REVEGETATION OF BARE PEAT WITH ADDITIONAL GULLY BLOCKING. FOLLOWING REVEGETATION THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEPTH TO WATER TABLE AND AN INCREASE IN THE PREVALENCE OF HILLSLOPE OVERLAND FLOW PRODUCTION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STORM RUNOFF COEFFICIENT FOLLOWING EITHER RESTORATION TREATMENT. STORM HYDROGRAPHS FOLLOWING REVEGETATION HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER LAG TIMES (106% INCREASE RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL), REDUCED PEAK FLOWS (27% DECREASE RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL), AND ATTENUATED HYDROGRAPH SHAPES. WITH THE ADDITION OF GULLY BLOCKING THE EFFECT IS ALMOST DOUBLED. LAG TIMES INCREASED BY A FURTHER 94% AND PEAK FLOWS REDUCED BY AN ADDITIONAL 24% RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL. WE ARGUE THAT THE PRIMARY PROCESS CONTROLLING THE OBSERVED CHANGES IN STORM HYDROGRAPH BEHAVIOUR IS RETARDATION OF OVERLAND STORMFLOW DUE TO INCREASED SURFACE ROUGHNESS. THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO LAG TIMES AND PEAK FLOW PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE RESTORATION OF DEGRADED HEADWATER PEATLANDS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO NATURAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT AND THE REDUCTION OF DOWNSTREAM FLOOD RISK, SUBJECT TO WIDER CATCHMENT SCALE EFFECTS AND SUB-CATCHMENT STORM HYDROGRAPH SYNCHRONICITY. 2018 THE AUTHORS","FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT; GULLY BLOCKING; NATURAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT; PEATLAND HYDROLOGY; RE-VEGETATION; WATER TABLES","CATCHMENTS; FLOOD CONTROL; GROUNDWATER; PEAT; RESTORATION; REVEGETATION; RISK MANAGEMENT; RUNOFF; SOIL CONSERVATION; STORMS; SURFACE ROUGHNESS; WETLANDS; FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT; GULLY BLOCKING; NATURAL FLOOD; PEATLAND; WATER TABLES; FLOODS; CATCHMENT; FLOOD; FLOOD CONTROL; HEADWATER; HILLSLOPE; HYDROLOGY; OVERLAND FLOW; PEAK DISCHARGE; PEAK FLOW; PEATLAND; REVEGETATION; RUNOFF; SNOWSTORM; STORM; WATER TABLE; ENGLAND; PENNINES; UNITED KINGDOM","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",1,"UPLAND ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF GEOGRAPHY, SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENT, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT, UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTERM13 9PL, UNITED KINGDOM; MOORS FOR THE FUTURE PARTNERSHIP, MOORLAND CENTRE, FIELDHEAD, HOPE VALLEY, S33 7ZA, UNITED KINGDOM; NATURAL RESOURCES WALES, YNYSLAS, BORTHSY24 5JZ, UNITED KINGDOM; SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, NE1 7RU, UNITED KINGDOM","10.1016/J.HYDROA.2018.100006","100006","SHUTTLEWORTH, E.L., UPLAND ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH UNIT, DEPARTMENT OF GEOGRAPHY, SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENT, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT, UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTERUNITED KINGDOM, EMAIL: EMMA.SHUTTLEWORTHMANCHESTER.AC.UK",NA,NA,"25899155",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","2",2019,"none","SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENT;MOORLAND CENTRE;NATURAL RESOURCES WALES;NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY","UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTERUNITED KINGDOM",NA,"SHUTTLEWORTH EL, 2019, JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X","SHUTTLEWORTH EL, 2019, JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X"

THEN, THE OPTIMIZED 32-STEP ELEMENTAL REACTION WAS COMBINED WITH CFD SOFTWARE. AN EDDY-DISSIPATION CONCEPT MODEL CONSIDERING DETAILED CHEMICAL REACTIONS WAS USED TO SIMULATE THE TRANSFORMATION BEHAVIOR OF SODIUM-CONTAINING SUBSTANCES. THE COMBUSTION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 660 MW FACE-FIRED BOILER UNDER VARIOUS LOADS WERE ALSO SIMULATED. THE FIELD DISTRIBUTION IN THE FURNACE AND THE MIGRATION PATH OF SODIUM ALONG THE TRACK OF PULVERIZED COAL PARTICLES WERE OBTAINED. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE INTERFERENCE BETWEEN EACH BURNER IN THE FURNACE IS SMALL AT THE BMCR LOAD, AND THE PHENOMENON OF WIND WRAPPING FIRE IS DISTINCTLY CLEAR. THE TEMPERATURE AT FURNACE OUTLET IS APPROXIMATELY 970.98 C. AT A LOW LOAD, THE COMBUSTION IN THE FURNACE IS STABLE, AND THE TEMPERATURE AT THE FURNACE OUTLET REACHES THE DESIGN VALUE. THE SODIUM PRESENT IN ZD COAL IS INVOLVED IN THE REACTION AFTER IT IS RELEASED IN THE FORM OF NA AND NACL. SODIUM IS PRESENT IN DIFFERENT FORMS IN THE MAIN BURNER ZONE, MAINLY NACL (67%), NAOH (12%), NA (9%), AND NA2SO4 (7%). THE FORMS OF SODIUM AT THE FURNACE OUTLET ARE NACL (50%), NA2SO4 (37%), NA2CL2 (9%) AND NAHSO4 (4%). A SMALL AMOUNT OF NA2SO4 IS FORMED BY NAHSO4 REACTION IN THE MAIN BURNER ZONE. IT THEN REACTS TO FORM NASO4, WHEREIN NAHSO4 IS FORMED BY PATH 2. NA2SO4 IS MAINLY GENERATED IN THE BURNOUT ZONE THROUGH PATH 1, AND PATHS 2, 3, AND 4 ARE HARDLY OBSERVED.

THE EXTRACTION METHODS TESTED WERE ULTRASONIC AGITATION AND MECHANICAL SHAKING, WHILE THE SUBSTRATES WERE CELLULOSE FIBRE (CF) AND GLASS FIBRE (GF). TESTS WERE CARRIED ON SUBSTRATES SPIKED WITH KNOWN AMOUNTS OF IODIDE AND IODATE AND ON A PAIR OF AMBIENT AEROSOL SAMPLES COLLECTED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA ON BOTH SUBSTRATES OVER THE SAME TIME PERIOD. THE COMBINATION OF ULTRASONIC AGITATION AND CF SUBSTRATES (WHICH HAS BEEN USED IN MANY PUBLISHED STUDIES OF AEROSOL IODINE SPECIATION) WAS SHOWN TO LEAD TO VARIABLE RECOVERY OF IODINE SPECIES AND CHANGES IN SPECIATION OVER EXTRACTION TIME. MECHANICAL SHAKING OF GF SUBSTRATES GAVE GOOD RECOVERIES OF IODIDE AND IODATE FROM SPIKED EXPERIMENTS AND STABLE SPECIATION WITH TIME FOR THE AMBIENT AEROSOL SAMPLE. THIS COMBINATION IS RECOMMENDED FOR FUTURE USE IN THE DETERMINATION OF AEROSOL IODINE SPECIATION.

CONSIDERED MOUNTAIN-BY-MOUNTAIN, PROXIMITY TO SOURCES DETERMINES THE CONCENTRATIONS OF PCBS: GROUSE MOUNTAIN, IMMEDIATELY TO THE NORTH OF VANCOUVER, HAD THE HIGHEST PCB CONCENTRATIONS IN BOTH ATMOSPHERIC GAS PHASE AND SOIL, WHILE THREE OTHER MOUNTAINS IN SOUTHERN BC HAD LEVELS APPROXIMATELY A FACTOR OF THREE LOWER. PCB CONCENTRATIONS ALONG THE CHILKOOT TRAIL IN REMOTE NORTHERN BC WERE MORE THAN AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LOWER. WHILE GROUSE MOUNTAIN ALSO HAD THE HIGHEST PAH CONCENTRATIONS, GAS PHASE CONCENTRATIONS OF PAHS ELSEWHERE WERE ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER AND VARIED LITTLE BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT MOUNTAINS. SOIL CONCENTRATIONS OF PAHS WERE HIGHLY ELEVATED ON URBAN GROUSE MOUNTAIN AND LOWEST ON BLUE GROUSE MOUNTAIN, WHICH STANDS OUT BY HAVING THE DRIEST CLIMATE. ON A SITE-BY-SITE BASIS, PCB CONCENTRATIONS IN THE ATMOSPHERIC GAS PHASE DECREASED WITH INCREASING ELEVATION BUT SHOW INDICATION OF UPSLOPE ENRICHMENT IN THE SOILS OF THREE OF THE MOUNTAINS.

STRUCT. BIOL. X","PREFERRED PARTICLE ORIENTATION PRESENTS A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR MANY SINGLE PARTICLE CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY (CRYO-EM) SAMPLES. ORIENTATION BIAS LIMITS THE ANGULAR INFORMATION USED TO GENERATE THREE-DIMENSIONAL MAPS AND THUS AFFECTS THE RELIABILITY AND INTERPRETABILITY OF THE STRUCTURAL MODELS. THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF PREFERRED ORIENTATION IS PRESUMED TO BE DUE TO ADSORPTION OF THE PARTICLES AT THE AIR/WATER INTERFACE DURING CRYO-EM GRID PREPARATION. TO AMELIORATE THIS PROBLEM, DETERGENTS ARE OFTEN ADDED TO CRYO-EM SAMPLES TO ALTER THE PROPERTIES OF THE AIR/WATER INTERFACE. WE HAVE FOUND THAT MANY BACTERIAL TRANSCRIPTION COMPLEXES SUFFER SEVERE ORIENTATION BIAS WHEN EXAMINED BY CRYO-EM. THE ADDITION OF NON-IONIC DETERGENTS, SUCH AS NP-40, DOES NOT REMOVE THE ORIENTATION BIAS BUT THE ZWITTER-IONIC DETERGENT CHAPSO SIGNIFICANTLY BROADENS THE PARTICLE ORIENTATION DISTRIBUTIONS, YIELDING ISOTROPICALLY UNIFORM MAPS. WE USED CRYO-ELECTRON TOMOGRAPHY TO EXAMINE THE PARTICLE DISTRIBUTION WITHIN THE ICE LAYER OF CRYO-EM GRID PREPARATIONS OF ESCHERICHIA COLI 6S RNA/RNA POLYMERASE HOLOENZYME PARTICLES. IN THE ABSENCE OF CHAPSO, ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE PARTICLES ARE LOCATED AT THE ICE SURFACES. CHAPSO AT THE CRITICAL MICELLE CONCENTRATION COATS THE AIR/WATER INTERFACE AND ELIMINATES PARTICLE ABSORPTION THERE, ALLOWING PARTICLES TO RANDOMLY ORIENT WITHIN THE VITREOUS ICE LAYER. WE FIND THAT CHAPSO REDUCES ORIENTATION BIAS FOR A NUMBER OF BACTERIAL TRANSCRIPTION COMPLEXES CONTAINING E. COLI OR MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS RNA POLYMERASES. FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY CONFIRM THE PRESUMED BASIS FOR HOW DETERGENTS CAN HELP REMOVE ORIENTATION BIAS IN CRYO-EM SAMPLES AND ESTABLISHES CHAPSO AS A USEFUL TOOL TO FACILITATE CRYO-EM STUDIES OF BACTERIAL TRANSCRIPTION COMPLEXES. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S)","BACTERIAL TRANSCRIPTION COMPLEXES; CHAPSO; CRYO-ELECTRON MICROSCOPY; CRYO-ELECTRON TOMOGRAPHY","3 [(3 CHOLAMIDOPROPYL)DIMETHYLAMMONIO] 2 HYDROXY 1 PROPANESULFONIC ACID; BACTERIAL RNA; RNA 16S; RNA POLYMERASE; ADSORPTION; ARTICLE; CONCENTRATION (PARAMETER); CRITICAL MICELLE CONCENTRATION; CRYOELECTRON MICROSCOPY; ELECTRON TOMOGRAPHY; ESCHERICHIA COLI; MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS; NONHUMAN; PARTICLE SIZE; PRIORITY JOURNAL; RETROSPECTIVE STUDY","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",2,"LABORATORY OF MOLECULAR BIOPHYSICS, THE ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK, NY 10065, UNITED STATES; NATIONAL RESOURCE FOR AUTOMATED MOLECULAR MICROSCOPY, SIMONS ELECTRON MICROSCOPY CENTER, NEW YORK STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY CENTER, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES","10.1016/J.YJSBX.2019.100005","100005","DARST, S.A., THE ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY, 1230 YORK AVENUE, UNITED STATES, EMAIL: DARSTROCKEFELLER.EDU",NA,NA,"25901524",NA,NA,"ACADEMIC PRESS INC.",NA,"SCOPUS","1",2019,"none","THE ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY;SIMONS ELECTRON MICROSCOPY CENTER","THE ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY",NA,"CHEN J, 2019, J STRUCT BIOL X","CHEN J, 2019, J STRUCT BIOL X"

IN THIS STUDY, WE PRESENT A NOVEL REPORTER SYSTEM FOR IMPROVED MONITORING OF TRANSCRIPTION IN E. COLI BASED ON -GALACTOSIDASE -COMPLEMENTATION. IN THIS REPORTER SYSTEM, THE -GALACTOSIDASE ACTIVITY RESULTING FROM THE ASSEMBLY OF A REPORTER LACZ AND AN EXISTING -ACCEPTOR IN ADVANCE SERVES AS A MEASURE OF TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY IN VIVO. TO VALIDATE THE POTENTIAL OF THE LACZ-DERIVED REPORTER SYSTEM, A SERIES OF ARTIFICIAL OPERONS WERE CONSTRUCTED, AND THE MODERATELY STRONG LAC PROMOTER, ARA PROMOTER, AND WEAK PBR PROMOTER WERE CHOSEN AS THE DETECTION PROMOTERS. THE RESPONSE PROFILES OF LACZ WAS SIMILAR TO THAT OF WILD TYPE LACZ IN ARTIFICIAL LAC OPERONS. DUE TO ITS SMALL SIZE AND EFFICIENT EXPRESSION PROFILE, THE DETECTION SENSITIVITY OF A LACZ-DERIVED REPORTER SYSTEM WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE TRADITIONAL FULL-LENGTH -GALACTOSIDASE AND THE FLUORESCENT PROTEIN MCHERRY REPORTER SYSTEM IN ARTIFICIAL ARA OPERONS. AS EXPECTED, THE RESPONSE SENSITIVITY OF THE LACZ-DERIVED REPORTER SYSTEM WAS ALSO DEMONSTRATED TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE -GALACTOSIDASE AND MCHERRY REPORTER SYSTEMS IN LEAD-SENSITIVE ARTIFICIAL PBR OPERONS.

A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM OF EXPERTS WAS ASSEMBLED THAT WORKED IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER WITH COLLEAGUES IN MYANMAR, FIRST TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMS RELATED TO MANAGING SNAKEBITE AND THEN DEVELOP INTERVENTIONS AIMED TO IMPROVE SELECTED PROBLEM AREAS. A BROAD APPROACH WAS ADOPTED, COVERING ANTIVENOM PRODUCTION, ANTIVENOM DISTRIBUTION AND HEALTH SYSTEM MANAGEMENT OF SNAKEBITE. PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED IN ANTIVENOM PRODUCTION INCLUDED POOR SNAKE HUSBANDRY RESULTING IN POOR SURVIVAL OF CAPTIVE SPECIMENS, LACK OF GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY, POOR HORSE HUSBANDRY, RESULTING IN HIGH MORTALITY, INADEQUATE STOCK ACQUISITION PROTOCOLS AND DATA COLLECTION, AND INAPPROPRIATE IMMUNISATION AND BLEEDING TECHNIQUES, AND INADEQUATE PRODUCTION CAPACITY FOR FREEZE DRIED ANTIVENOMS AND QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEMS. THESE PROBLEMS WERE ADDRESSED IN VARIOUS WAYS, RESULTING IN SOME SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS. ANTIVENOM DISTRIBUTION IS BEING REORGANISED TO ACHIEVE BETTER AVAILABILITY AND UTILISATION OF STOCK.

WATER SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER BASIN INCLUDING FROM THE MISSISSIPPI AND RED RIVERS AS WELL AS BASIN SWAMP WATERS DURING APRIL AND NOVEMBER 2010, AND JUNE 2011, WHICH REPRESENT TYPICAL HIGH AND LOW, AND UNUSUAL HIGH RIVER DISCHARGES, RESPECTIVELY. WITHIN THE TOTAL DISSOLVED (<0.45 M) POOL, MOST OF THE TES WERE MAINLY PARTITIONED TO THE <0.02 M DISSOLVED PHASE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CR, CS, FE, PB AND ZN WHICH WERE DOMINANTLY IN THE COLLOIDAL (0.020.45 M) PHASE. IN THE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER, SEASONAL CONCENTRATION VARIATIONS IN NUTRIENTS, DOC AND MOST TES WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER, REFLECTING A MAJOR CONTRIBUTION OF WATER FROM THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE RED RIVER TO THE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER'S DOC AND NUTRIENTS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE 135%, SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS ESTIMATES FOR THIS SYSTEM. THE RED RIVER CONTRIBUTION TO THE FLUXES OF CO, CR, CS, FE, MN, PB, RB, AND ZN WAS GENERALLY DISPROPORTIONALLY HIGH (>20%), EXCEEDING ITS HYDROLOGICAL CONTRIBUTION (10%) TO THE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER, DUE TO GREATLY ENRICHED CONCENTRATIONS OF THESE ELEMENTS IN THE RED RIVER. THE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER BASIN WETLAND/FLOODPLAIN CONTRIBUTION TO CHEMICAL CONSTITUENTS WAS NOTICEABLE, ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN A 20% DECREASE OF SOME ELEMENTS (CD, CS, CR, CU, FE, MO, P, U, AND ZN). MN WAS THE ONLY ELEMENT WITH PERSISTENT ADDITION DURING ALL SAMPLING CAMPAIGNS. HOWEVER, THE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE RED RIVER WERE GREATER THAN THE WETLAND/FLOODPLAIN CONTRIBUTIONS FOR DOC, NUTRIENTS AND MOST OF TES (EXCEPT MN), SUGGESTING THAT THE RED RIVER PLAYS A DISPROPORTIONATE ROLE IN REGULATING WATER QUALITY IN THE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER. OVERALL, THE ATCHAFALAYA RIVER WITH ITS CHEMICAL MODIFICATION OF MISSISSIPPI RIVER WATER VIA CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE RED RIVER AND INTERACTIONS WITH FLOODPLAIN WETLANDS, PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN CHEMICAL DISTRIBUTIONS ON THE LOUISIANA SHELF IN THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE DENITRIFICATION DECOMPOSITION MODEL (DNDC), WHICH UTILIZES SIMPLIFIED HYDROLOGIC PROCESSES, TO A MORE COMPREHENSIVE WATER FLOW MODEL, THE ROOT ZONE WATER QUALITY MODEL (RZWQM2), TO DETERMINE WHICH PROCESSES ARE SUFFICIENT FOR SIMULATING WATER AND NITROGEN DYNAMICS AND RECOMMEND IMPROVEMENTS.

SOYBEAN AND CORN YIELD, AND CORN BIOMASS OVER THE GROWING SEASON WERE WELL SIMULATED BY BOTH MODELS (NRMSE < 25%). SOYBEAN YIELDS WERE ALSO VERY WELL SIMULATED BY BOTH MODELS (NRMSE < 20%), HOWEVER, SOYBEAN BIOMASS WAS OVER-PREDICTED BY RZWQM2 IN THE VALIDATION TREATMENTS. THE MAGNITUDE OF WINTER RYE BIOMASS AND N UPTAKE WAS WELL SIMULATED BUT THE TIMING OF GROWTH INITIATION IN THE SPRING WAS INACCURATE AT TIMES.

DNDC OVERESTIMATED SOIL WATER CONTENT NEAR THE SOIL SURFACE AND UNDERESTIMATED IT IN THE DEEPER PROFILE.

THEREFORE, SECTOR COUPLING, FOR EXAMPLE BY USING HEAT PUMP SYSTEMS, IS MANDATORY. INTEGRATED HOMES USE PHOTOVOLTAIC ENERGY FOR SPACE HEATING AND DOMESTIC HOT WATER TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DECARBONIZATION OF THE HEATING SECTOR. THE ECONOMICS ARE A KEY TO INCREASING THE MARKET PENETRATION OF INTEGRATED HOMES. COMBINED OPERATION STRATEGIES FOR THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR AS WELL AS FOR THE HEATING SECTOR CAN ENHANCE THE ECONOMICS OF THESE SYSTEMS. THIS PAPER ANALYSES DIFFERENT OPERATION STRATEGIES FOR BOTH ELECTRICAL AND THERMAL SYSTEMS AND EXAMINES THE GAIN IN EFFICIENCY BY COMBINED STRATEGIES. FURTHERMORE, THE DIMENSIONING OF THE DIFFERENT SYSTEM COMPONENTS HEAVILY INFLUENCES THE ECONOMICS OF THE INTEGRATED HOME. CAPITAL-INTENSIVE COMPONENTS, SUCH AS PHOTOVOLTAIC GENERATORS, BATTERY STORAGE SYSTEMS, HEAT PUMPS, AND THERMAL STORAGE UNITS, PLAY A MAJOR ROLE FOR THE PROFITABILITY. THEREFORE, THE OPTIMIZATION OF COMPONENT SIZING IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THE ECONOMICS OF THE SYSTEM.

THE IMPACT OF THE OPTIMIZATION ON THE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY IS HIGHER COMPARED TO THE INFLUENCE OF ADVANCED COMBINED OPERATION STRATEGIES. THE OPTIMIZATION INDICATES THAT RELATIVELY SMALL STORAGE UNITS ARE MORE ECONOMICAL.

THE LIFETIME COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF FF/UMEC/VI VERSUS BUD/FOR, BASED ON FULFIL DATA, IS REPORTED HERE. METHODS: A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED GALAXY-COPD LINKED-RISK EQUATION MODEL WAS USED TO ASSESS THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF FF/UMEC/VI FROM THE UK NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE (NHS) PERSPECTIVE. BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFICACY RESULTS FROM FULFIL AND UK NHS REFERENCE COST DATA (2017) WERE INCLUDED AS INPUTS. EXACERBATION RATES (UNDISCOUNTED), COSTS, LIFE YEARS (LYS, UNDISCOUNTED) AND QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (QALYS), AND THE INCREMENTAL COST-EFFECTIVENESS RATIO (ICER) WERE CALCULATED OVER A LIFETIME HORIZON. COSTS AND QALYS WERE DISCOUNTED AT 3.5% PER YEAR, BEYOND ONE YEAR, IN ACCORDANCE WITH NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND CARE EXCELLENCE (NICE) GUIDELINES. DETERMINISTIC AND PROBABILISTIC SENSITIVITY ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED TO EVALUATE THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE RESULTS. RESULTS: PREDICTED CUMULATIVE EXACERBATIONS PER PATIENT OVER A LIFETIME WERE 8.393 WITH FF/UMEC/VI AND 10.456 WITH BUD/FOR. PATIENTS RECEIVING FF/UMEC/VI GAINED AN ADDITIONAL 0.764 LYS AND 0.492 QALYS, AT AN ADDITIONAL MEAN COST OF 1,652, RESULTING IN AN ICER OF 3,357 PER QALY GAINED (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 1,816, 5,194) COMPARED WITH BUD/FOR. THE ICER REMAINED BELOW 6,000 IN ALL BUT ONE OF THE SCENARIO AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES. CONCLUSIONS: COMPARED WITH BUD/FOR, TREATMENT WITH FF/UMEC/VI WAS PREDICTED TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AT AN ADDITIONAL COST THAT SUGGESTS IT WOULD BE COST-EFFECTIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD IN THE UK. 2019 THE AUTHORS","CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; ECONOMIC EVALUATION; INHALED CORTICOSTEROID; LONG-ACTING MUSCARINIC ANTAGONIST; LONG-ACTING 2-AGONIST",NA,"ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC., 980 GREAT WEST ROAD, LONDON, TW8 9GS, UNITED KINGDOM; ICON PLC., SUITE 1000, 10TH FLOOR, 589 5TH AVENUE, NEW YORK, NY 10017, UNITED STATES; ICON PLC., 4 INNOVATION DRIVE, DUNDAS, ONTARIO, CANADA; GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC., STOCKLEY PARK, IRON BRIDGE ROAD N, WEST DRAYTON, UXBRIDGE, UB11 1BT, UNITED KINGDOM; GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC., 1250 SOUTH COLLEGEVILLE RD, COLLEGEVILLEPA 19426-0989, UNITED STATES; HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, INSTITUTE OF HEALTH & WELLBEING, UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW, 1 LILYBANK GARDENS, GLASGOW, G12 8RZ, UNITED KINGDOM; DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH RESEARCH METHODS, EVIDENCE AND IMPACT, MCMASTER UNIVERSITY, 1280, MAIN ST W, HAMILTON, ON L8S 4L8, CANADA","10.1016/J.YRMEX.2019.100008","100008","ISMAILA, A.S., GLAXOSMITHKLINE PLC., 1250 SOUTH COLLEGEVILLE ROAD, COLLEGEVILLE, UNITED STATES, EMAIL: AFISI.S.ISMAILAGSK.COM",NA,NA,"25901435",NA,NA,"W.B.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE POOR RECORD OF O3 AND SOLAR RADIATION MEASUREMENT IN WHEAT REGIONS, A REASONABLE ESTIMATE CAN BE MADE YIELD LOSSES AROUND 2010. FROM AN AVERAGE OF THE MORE CREDIBLE STUDIES, THIS IS AROUND 30% COMPARED TO THE YIELD WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED WITH 1970 SOLAR RADIATION AND O3 ASSUMED TO BE &LT,40 PPB (PARTS PER BILLION BY VOLUME). THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT O3 CAUSES TWO-THIRDS OF THE LOSS AND REDUCED TOTAL SOLAR RADIATION DUE TO AEROSOLS (BUT CORRECTED FOR INCREASED DIFFUSE RADIATION) ONE-THIRD. OZONE, IN PARTICULAR, APPEARS TO BE STILL INCREASING. IT IS LIKELY THAT INCREASED STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE (E.G. DUE TO MORE IRRIGATION (97% OF PRODUCTION NOW IRRIGATED) AND THE UNWITTING CONSEQUENCE OF BREEDING FOR INCREASED POTENTIAL YIELD) HAS ADDED TO CURRENT O3 LOSSES. MUCH IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGY OF O3 DAMAGE IN THE WHEAT LEAF AND PLANT. WHAT IS LACKING IS A THOROUGH SEARCH FOR GENETIC TOLERANCE INDEPENDENT OF STOMATAL CONDUCTANCE AND POTENTIAL YIELD PENALTIES, AND THIS REQUIRES, AT LEAST INITIALLY, MANY CHAMBER AND/OR FACE (FREE-AIR CO2 ENHANCEMENT) EXPERIMENTS UNDER TYPICAL INDIAN FIELD CONDITIONS. GENETIC ENGINEERING COULD OFFER A SOLUTION FOR O3 BUT ONLY IN THE LONG TERM. OTHER SOLUTIONS TO POLLUTION DAMAGE ARE VERY LIMITED, BUT EARLIER PLANTING SHOULD HELP WHEAT ESCAPE THE RISING O3 LEVEL IN THE SPRING. THE 40 MILLION TONNES OF WHEAT CURRENTLY FOREGONE ANNUALLY BY INDIA DUE TO THESE TWO POLLUTANTS, EVEN IF AN OVERESTIMATE, FAR EXCEEDS ESTIMATES OF WHEAT YIELD LOSS TO DATE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND DEMANDS CONCERTED ACTION TO REDUCE THE SOURCES OF THIS POLLUTION, BRINGING ADDED DIRECT ADVANTAGES FOR OTHER CROPS AND FOR HUMAN HEALTH.

A NEW CLASS OF HYBRID MODELS AIMS TO COMBINE THE INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS, I.E., COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND LOCAL ACCURACY ON THE MICRO SCALE, OF MODELS OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONALITY. WE PROPOSE, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME, A FULLY COUPLED MODEL CONCEPT THAT INVOLVES A (NAVIER-) STOKES MODEL FOR THE FREE FLOW AND A PORE-NETWORK MODEL FOR THE POROUS DOMAIN. AS A FIRST STEP, WE CONSIDER ISOTHERMAL SINGLE-PHASE FLOW WITH AND WITHOUT COMPONENT TRANSPORT, BUT THE MODEL IS OPEN FOR EXTENSION FOR MORE COMPLEX PHYSICS. APPROPRIATE COUPLING CONDITIONS GUARANTEE THE CONTINUITY OF MASS AND MOMENTUM FLUXES ACROSS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE TWO DOMAINS. THE COUPLED MODEL IS IMPLEMENTED IN DUMU(FIGURE PRESENTED.), AN OPEN-SOURCE TOOLBOX FOR THE SIMULATION OF FLOW IN POROUS MEDIA. WE USE A MONOLITHIC APPROACH, I.E., ALL BALANCE EQUATIONS ARE ASSEMBLED INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM MATRIX AND NO COUPLING ITERATIONS BETWEEN THE SUBMODELS ARE REQUIRED. NEWTON'S METHOD IS APPLIED TO SOLVE THE POTENTIALLY NON-LINEAR SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS. THE MODEL IS ABLE TO HANDLE BOTH STRUCTURED AND UNSTRUCTURED, RANDOMLY-GENERATED NETWORKS. FOR THE STRUCTURED POROUS DOMAINS, THE SIMULATION RESULTS OF THE COUPLED MODEL WERE COMPARED TO NUMERICAL REFERENCE SOLUTIONS WHERE EXCELLENT AGREEMENT WAS FOUND, BOTH FOR REYNOLDS NUMBERS BELOW ONE AND AROUND 400 IN THE FREE-FLOW CHANNEL. WHEN APPLIED TO A GEOMETRICALLY COMPLEX UNSTRUCTURED NETWORK AND CONSIDERING COMPOSITIONAL FLOW, CLEAR PATHS OF PREFERENTIAL FLOW COULD BE IDENTIFIED WHICH ALSO LOCALLY AFFECT THE ADJACENT REGION OF FREE FLOW AT THE RESPECTIVE INTERFACE.

THE ROLE OF CE-DOPING TO LA1.0-CO0.5TI0.5O3 MATERIAL CATALYTIC PERFORMANCES WAS ALSO INVESTIGATED. AMONG ALL THE CATALYSTS, CATALYST COMPOSITION OF LA0.8CE0.2-CO0.5TI0.5O3 DISPLAYED A STABLE TOLUENE CONVERSION OF AROUND 90% AT 700 C AND S/C OF 2 FOR A PERIOD OF 22 H TESTED IN TOLUENE REFORMING REACTION. ADDITIONALLY, LA0.8CE0.2-CO0.5TI0.5O3 CATALYST DISPLAYED STABLE SRT PERFORMANCE IN THE PRESENCE OF 500 PPM OF NOX. ON THE OTHER HAND, BY INTRODUCING 50 PPM OF H2S DURING SRT REACTION AT 750 C, ALL THE CATALYSTS SHOWED DEACTIVATION BEHAVIOUR.

THIS GRADIENT REFLECTS DIFFERENCES IN FLEET COMPOSITION ESPECIALLY GASOLINE POWERED VEHICLES IN PARIS WITH A LARGER PROPORTION OF TWO-WHEELERS (15% IN 2012). THIS GRADIENT IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE INTER-ANNUAL INCREASE OF TEX-TO-BENZENE RATIOS ALONG WITH THE DOUBLING OF TWO-WHEELERS USE AND THE DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PASSENGER CARS.

THE MECHANISM WHEREBY THESE SUPERCHARGED [M + ZH]Z+ IONS ARE FORMED UNDER UNFOLDED CONDITIONS REMAINS UNCLEAR. HERE WE EMPLOYED A COMBINATION OF MASS SPECTROMETRY (MS), ION MOBILITY SPECTROMETRY (IMS), AND MOLECULAR DYNAMICS (MD) SIMULATIONS FOR PROBING THE ESI MECHANISM UNDER DENATURED SUPERCHARGING CONDITIONS.

THE ELECTROSTATICALLY STRETCHED CONFORMATIONS PREDICTED BY THESE SIMULATIONS WERE IN AGREEMENT WITH IMS EXPERIMENTS. THE CEM INVOLVES PARTITIONING OF MOBILE H+ BETWEEN THE DROPLET AND THE DEPARTING PROTEIN. OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT SUPERCHARGING OF UNFOLDED PROTEINS IS CAUSED BY RESIDUAL SULFOLANE THAT STABILIZES PROTONATED SITES ON THE PROTRUDING CHAINS, THEREBY PROMOTING H+ RETENTION ON THE PROTEIN. THE STABILIZATION OF CHARGED SITES IS DUE TO CHARGE-DIPOLE INTERACTIONS MEDIATED BY THE LARGE DIPOLE MOMENT AND THE LOW VOLATILITY OF SULFOLANE.

GEOPHYS. RES. SOLID EARTH","OUTGASSING OF VOLCANIC SYSTEMS IS A UBIQUITOUS PHENOMENON. YET THE MECHANISMS FACILITATING GAS ESCAPE FROM VESICULATING MAGMAS AND LAVAS REMAIN POORLY UNDERSTOOD. PERVASIVE OUTGASSING IS THOUGHT TO DEPEND ON THE EFFICIENT AND ABUNDANT FORMATION OF PERMEABLE PATHWAYS. HERE WE PRESENT RESULTS FROM EXPERIMENTS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY THE CONDITIONS AND MECHANISMS NEEDED TO FORM SUCH PERMEABLE PATHWAYS. WE USE A FOAMED SILICATE MELT (FOAMGLAS) IN OUR EXPERIMENTS AS A PROXY FOR NATURAL VESICULAR MELTS. FOAMGLAS CORES ARE COMPRESSED UNDER A RANGE OF TEMPERATURES AND STRAIN RATES, AND RESULTS ARE EVALUATED AGAINST THE STATE OF MELT RELAXATION (PARAMETERIZED USING THE DEBORAH NUMBER). WE FIND THAT FOAM MICROSTRUCTURE AND RHEOLOGICAL AND OUTGASSING BEHAVIORS EVOLVE WITH STRAIN AND AS A FUNCTION OF MELT RELAXATION STATE. RELAXED MELT FOAMS HARDEN DURING DEFORMATION BUT REMAIN IMPERMEABLE. AS FOAMS BECOME LESS RELAXED AT HIGHER STRAIN RATE AND/OR MELT VISCOSITY, THEY SHOW COMPLEX RESPONSES TO DEFORMATION (STRAIN WEAKENING AND HARDENING) YET REMAIN IMPERMEABLE. STRAIN LOCALIZATION AND FORMATION OF HIGH-PERMEABILITY BANDS OCCUR ONLY IN HIGHLY STRAINED, UNRELAXED FOAMS. HOWEVER, THESE BANDS ARE THIN AND ORIENTED PERPENDICULAR TO THE PRINCIPAL STRESS, RESULTING IN LIMITED OUTGASSING. PERMEABLE PATHWAYS DO NOT READILY FORM IN FOAMS, RATHER, HIGH-POROSITY MELTS ARE PERSISTENTLY IMPERMEABLE. OUR RESULTS IMPLY THAT VESICULAR SILICIC LAVAS MAY NOT OUTGAS AS EFFICIENTLY AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. INSTEAD, SUSTAINED IMPERMEABILITY ALLOWS THE LAVA TO MAINTAIN LOW EFFECTIVE VISCOSITIES, AND TO FLOW EXTENDED DISTANCES. IN ADDITION, PORE PRESSURES MAY RISE IN DEFORMING IMPERMEABLE LAVAS, PERHAPS PRIMING THE LAVA FOR LATER EXPLOSIVE BEHAVIOR. 2019. AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION.

CHEM. PHYS.","ELECTRON TRANSFER IS THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL REACTION IN CHEMISTRY, YET ITS EXACT MECHANISTIC DETAILS ARE OFTEN COMPLEX. LACCASES ARE IMPORTANT ELECTRON-TRANSFER ENZYMES OF SUBSTANTIAL UTILITY IN BLEACHING, BIOREMEDIATION, CATALYTIC SYNTHESIS, AND ENZYMATIC FUEL CELLS. THESE MULTI-COPPER OXIDASES CATALYZE THE ONE-ELECTRON OXIDATION OF SUBSTRATES BY OUTER-SPHERE ELECTRON TRANSFER TO A COPPER T1 SITE, AND SUBSEQUENT INTRAMOLECULAR ELECTRON TRANSFER TO A TRI-NUCLEAR COPPER SITE WHERE O2 IS REDUCED TO WATER. UNDERSTANDING THE MOLECULAR MECHANISM OF THE FIRST, SUPPOSEDLY RATE-DETERMINING PURE ELECTRON TRANSFER STEP IS OF MAJOR FUNDAMENTAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL INTEREST. IT IS WIDELY THOUGHT THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE HALF POTENTIALS OF THE SUBSTRATE AND THE T1 COPPER ENABLES THE POWERFUL ELECTRON ABSTRACTION FROM NEARBY SUBSTRATES. HOWEVER, THE REORGANIZATION ENERGY DURING ELECTRON TRANSFER COULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO CATALYTIC TURNOVER. TO EXPLORE THIS, WE COMPUTED THE SELF-EXCHANGE REORGANIZATION ENERGIES OF 54 SUBSTRATES WITH EXPERIMENTALLY KNOWN ACTIVITY OR KCAT DATA USING DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY. WE SHOW THAT THE ENERGY COSTS OF CHANGING THE SUBSTRATE GEOMETRIES DURING ELECTRON REMOVAL CORRELATE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH EXPERIMENTAL ACTIVITY DATA WITH A PHYSICALLY MEANINGFUL DIRECTION OF CORRELATION. THIS MEANS THAT SUBSTRATE ELECTRONIC REORGANIZATION, RATHER THAN ONLY POTENTIAL DIFFERENCES, PLAYS A ROLE IN THE ACTIVITY OF ELECTRON TRANSFER PROTEINS SUCH AS LACCASES.

THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF METHANOLIC LEAF EXTRACT OF BAUHINIA MONANDRA AS A POTENTIAL ANTIDOTE FOR TREATING HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA (HIT). A TOTAL OF 30 MICE WERE USED FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. THE MICE WERE DIVIDED INTO FIVE GROUPS (I-V) OF SIX MICE EACH. GROUP I (NORMAL CONTROL) WAS GIVEN DISTILLED WATER ONLY, AND GROUP II (POSITIVE CONTROL) WAS GIVEN HEPARIN ONLY. GROUPS III, IV, AND V (TREATMENT GROUPS) WERE GIVEN HEPARIN AND METHANOLIC LEAF EXTRACT OF B. MONANDRA AT A DOSE OF 100, 200, AND 400 MG/KG BODY WEIGHT (B. WT), RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED TO DETERMINE THE BLOOD PLATELET COUNT. BLEEDING TIME AND CLOTTING TIME WERE ALSO DETERMINED. THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT THE MICE IN THE GROUP TREATED WITH METHANOLIC LEAF EXTRACT OF B. MONANDRA AT A DOSE OF 400 MG/KG B.

MED. X","BACKGROUND: MANY PATIENTS WITH COPD ARE VENTILATORY LIMITED AND UNABLE TO TOLERATE EFFECTIVE LEVELS OF AEROBIC TRAINING. A SCOOTER COULD BE AN ENTICING TRAINING MODALITY IF MUSCLE ACTIVITY IS PARTITIONED AND DISTAL LEG MUSCLE ACTIVITY IS EMPHASIZED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SCOOTING MIGHT EMPHASIZE LEG HEAVINESS (DESIRED MUSCLE BURDEN), RELATIVE TO THE BREATHING HEAVINESS, WHEN COMPARED WITH WALKING. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED TWO ENDURANCE TESTS, WALKING AND SCOOTING. THE INTENSITY FOR EACH TARGETED SIMILAR TOLERABLE EXERCISE TIMES (T LIMIT ) SIMULATING COMPARABLE TRAINING SESSION EXPOSURE. PARTICIPANTS SCORED (BORG 0-10 ) LEG AND BREATHING HEAVINESS THROUGHOUT EACH TEST AND THE SLOPE CALCULATED. ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO QUANTIFY LEG MUSCLE ACTIVITY. RESULTS: 15 PARTICIPANTS WITH COPD (MEAN[SD]: AGE=64[11]Y, FEV 1=52[17]%PREDICTED, FEV 1 /FVC=50[10]%) COMPLETED THE STUDY. SUCCESSFUL MATCHING OF INTENSITY BETWEEN MODALITIES WAS DEMONSTRATED BY SIMILAR T LIMIT (DIFFERENCE [95%CI]=-0.3[-2.8 TO 2.1]MIN). SCOOTING RESULTED IN MORE (60[24 TO 95]%) ACTIVITY OF THE GASTROCNEMIUS IN THE PROPULSION AND LESS (82[-91 TO 72]%) IN THE SUPPORT LEG. RECTUS FEMORIS ACTIVITY WAS REDUCED (68[-95 TO 41]%) AND INCREASED (117[49 TO 184]%) IN THE PROPULSION AND SUPPORT LEG, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (0.1[-0.1 TO 0.2]) IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BREATHING AND LEG HEAVINESS WHEN SCOOTING WAS COMPARED TO WALKING. CONCLUSIONS: SCOOTING IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED ACTIVITY OF THE DISTAL MUSCLES OF PROPULSION OF THE SCOOTING LEG. HOWEVER, THIS IS OFFSET BY THE INCREASED ACTIVITY OF THE SUPPORT LEG AS IT RESISTS THE ROTATIONAL FORCE OF PROPULSION, SUCH THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BREATHING AND LEG HEAVINESS IS NOT ALTERED. 2019","EXERCISE; HUMAN; LUNG DISEASES; MUSCLE; OBSTRUCTIVE; PHYSICAL CONDITIONING; PULMONARY REHABILITATION; SKELETAL","ADULT; AEROBIC EXERCISE; ARTICLE; BREATHING; CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE; CLINICAL ARTICLE; COMPARATIVE STUDY; CONTROLLED STUDY; CROSSOVER PROCEDURE; ELECTROMYOGRAPHY; ENDURANCE TRAINING; FEMALE; FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME; FORCED VITAL CAPACITY; GASTROCNEMIUS MUSCLE; HUMAN; LEG MOVEMENT; LEG MUSCLE; MALE; MUSCLE CONTRACTION; PHYSICAL ACTIVITY; PRIORITY JOURNAL; PULMONARY REHABILITATION; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL; RECTUS FEMORIS MUSCLE; SCOOTING; WALKING; WALKING SPEED","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"DEPARTMENT OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE, WEST PARK HEALTHCARE CENTRE, TORONTO, ONTARIO M6M 2J5, CANADA; RESPIRATORY REHABILITATION, WEST PARK HEALTHCARE CENTRE, TORONTO, ONTARIO M6M 2J5, CANADA; RESPIRATORY DIAGNOSTIC & EVALUATION SERVICES, WEST PARK HEALTHCARE CENTRE, TORONTO, ONTARIO M6M 2J5, CANADA; DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL THERAPY, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 1A1, CANADA; DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTOONTARIO M5S 1A1, CANADA","10.1016/J.YRMEX.2019.100005","100005","DOLMAGE, T.E.82 BUTTONWOOD AVENUE, CANADA, EMAIL: TOM.DOLMAGEWESTPARK.ORG",NA,NA,"25901435",NA,NA,"W.B.

IN COLD CLIMATES, FARMERS HAVE LIMITED OPPORTUNITY TO BALANCE FIELD ACTIVITIES AND MANURE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS WHILE LIMITING NUTRIENT LOSSES. A REVISED DENITRIFICATION DECOMPOSITION (DNDC) MODEL FOR SIMULATING TILE DRAINAGE WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE FERTILIZER SCENARIOS WHEN APPLYING DAIRY SLURRY OR UREA ON SILAGE CORN (ZEAMAYSL.) TO EXAMINE N LOSSES OVER A MULTIDECADAL HORIZON AT LOCATIONS IN EASTERN CANADA AND THE US MIDWEST. MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS INCLUDED TIMING (SPRING, FALL, SPLIT, AND SIDEDRESS) AND METHOD OF APPLICATION (INJECTED [10 CM], INCORPORATED [5 CM], AND BROADCAST). REACTIVE N LOSSES (NO3 FROM DRAINAGE AND RUNOFF, N2O, AND NH3) WERE GREATEST FROM BROADCAST, FOLLOWED BY INCORPORATED AND THEN INJECTED APPLICATIONS. AMONG THE FERTILIZER TIMING SCENARIOS, FALL MANURE APPLICATION RESULTED IN THE GREATEST N LOSS, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED N LEACHING IN NON-GROWING-SEASON PERIODS, WITH 58% MORE N LOSS PER METRIC TON OF SILAGE THAN SPRING APPLICATION. SPLIT AND SIDEDRESS MINERAL FERTILIZER HAD THE LOWEST N LOSSES, WITH AVERAGE REDUCTIONS OF 9.5 AND 4.9%, RESPECTIVELY, RELATIVE TO A SINGLE APPLICATION. SPLIT APPLICATION MITIGATED LOSSES MORE SO THAN SIDEDRESS BY REDUCING THE SOIL PH SHIFT DUE TO UREA HYDROLYSIS AND NH3 VOLATILIZATION DURING THE WARMER JUNE PERIOD. THIS ASSESSMENT HELPS TO DISTINGUISH WHICH FERTILIZER PRACTICES ARE MORE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING N LOSS OVER A LONG-TERM TIME HORIZON. REACTIVE N LOSS IS RANKED ACROSS 18 FERTILIZER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, WHICH COULD ASSIST FARMERS IN WEIGHING THE TRADEOFFS BETWEEN FIELD TRAFFICABILITY, MANURE STORAGE CAPACITY, AND EXPECTED N LOSS. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S) AND HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF CANADA, AS REPRESENTED BY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE & AGRI-FOOD CANADA.

HOWEVER, WHETHER A DIFFERENT LIFE COURSE OF WEIGHT IN MEN AND WOMEN MAY EXPLAIN GENDER DIFFERENCES IN ASTHMA INCIDENCE, HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED. OBJECTIVES: USING DATA FROM THE SWISS COHORT STUDY ON AIR POLLUTION AND LUNG AND HEART DISEASES IN ADULTS, WE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY AS MEASURED BY BODY SILHOUETTES AT DIFFERENT LIFE STAGES IN MEN AND WOMEN FOR ASTHMA INCIDENCE. METHODS: OUR ANALYSIS INCLUDED 5417 SUBJECTS WHO WERE ASTHMA FREE AT AGE 8, FOLLOWED UP TO 2011, AND HAD COMPLETE COVARIATE INFORMATION. THE MAIN PREDICTOR OF INTEREST WAS SELF-REPORTED BODY SILHOUETTES AT AGE 8, MENARCHE, 30, 45, MENOPAUSE, AND 60, AND ADDITIONALLY CHANGES IN BODY SILHOUETTE NUMBER ACROSS THESE DIFFERENT TIME POINTS. ASTHMA INCIDENCE WAS DEFINED AS NEWLY REPORTED DOCTOR-DIAGNOSED ASTHMA AFTER THE BODY SILHOUETTE TIME POINT. ASTHMA INCIDENCE AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH BODY SILHOUETTES WAS ANALYSED USING SEX STRATIFIED LOGISTIC REGRESSION, ADJUSTING FOR AGE, ATOPY, URBANITY, SMOKING, PARENTAL ASTHMA, EDUCATION AND STUDY AREA. RESULTS: MEN AT AGE 60 HAD AN INCREASED RISK OF ASTHMA INCIDENCE PER UNIT INCREASE IN BODY SILHOUETTE NUMBER (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.133.30). THIS ASSOCIATION WAS STRONGER IN WOMEN AT AGE 60 (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.495.18) AND OBSERVED ALSO AT MENOPAUSE (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.031.78), AS WELL AS PER UNIT CHANGE IN BODY SILHOUETTE NUMBER BETWEEN AGE 45 MENOPAUSE (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.152.63).

WE APPLIED THE CFS METHOD IN THE BIG CYPRESS NATIONAL PRESERVE, WHERE WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT SURFACE CONNECTIVITY EPISODES CONTROL WATER AND SOLUTE FLUX, WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR EXPORTED CARBONATE WEATHERING PRODUCTS AND THUS FOR KARST LANDFORM EVOLUTION.

ONE PARTICULAR FORMULATION OF QUANTUM DYNAMICS ADVOCATED HERE IS IN THE FORM OF A MACHINE LEARNING SIMULATOR OF THE SCHRDINGER EQUATION. IF COMBINED WITH THE BAYESIAN STATISTICS, SUCH A SIMULATOR ALLOWS ONE TO OBTAIN NOT ONLY THE QUANTUM PREDICTIONS BUT ALSO THE ERROR BARS OF THE DYNAMICAL RESULTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNCERTAINTIES OF INPUTS (SUCH AS THE POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACE OR NON-ADIABATIC COUPLINGS) INTO THE NUCLEAR SCHRDINGER EQUATION. INSTEAD OF VIEWING ATOMS AS UNDERGOING DYNAMICS ON A GIVEN POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACE, BAYESIAN MACHINE LEARNING ALLOWS ONE TO FORMULATE THE PROBLEM AS THE SCHRDINGER EQUATION WITH A NON-PARAMETRIC DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIAL ENERGY SURFACES THAT BECOMES CONDITIONED BY THE DESIRED DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES (SUCH AS THE EXPERIMENTAL MEASUREMENTS). MACHINE LEARNING MODELS OF THE SCHRDINGER EQUATION SOLUTIONS CAN IDENTIFY THE SENSITIVITY OF THE DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE POTENTIAL SURFACE, THE COLLISION ENERGY, ANGULAR MOMENTUM, EXTERNAL FIELD PARAMETERS AND BASIS SETS USED FOR THE CALCULATIONS.

MED. X","BACKGROUND: THERE ARE SIMILAR RISK FACTORS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) AND LUNG CANCER. IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT COPD IS COMMON IN PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER. HOWEVER, THE PREVALENCE OF LUNG CANCER IN THE COPD POPULATION REMAINS UNCLEAR. WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE PREVALENCE OF LUNG CANCER IN COPD. METHODS: FOUR DATABASES (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PUBMED, CINAHL) EXAMINING THE PREVALENCE OF LUNG CANCER IN COPD WERE SEARCHED FOR STUDIES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1997 AND 2018. META-ANALYSIS WITH A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL WAS USED TO CALCULATE POOLED PREVALENCE FOR THE INCLUDED STUDIES. A SUB-GROUP ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED FOR STUDIES OF SIMILAR POPULATION AND DESIGN. ODDS RATIOS WERE CALCULATED FOR CASE-CONTROL STUDIES. RESULTS: TWENTY-ONE STUDIES THAT EXAMINED THE PREVALENCE OF LUNG CANCER IN A POPULATION OF 1,682,908 INDIVIDUALS WITH COPD WERE INCLUDED. THE POOLED PREVALENCE FOR LUNG CANCER IN COPD WAS 2.79% (95% CI: 1.883.88). RESULTS ARE CONFOUNDED BY SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY AMONG STUDIES (Q=12,622, I 2=100%), PARTICULARLY RELATED TO THE LARGE VARIATION IN SAMPLE SIZE AND STUDY DESIGN. SEVEN STUDIES COMPARED LUNG CANCER PREVALENCE IN COPD TO CONTROLS WITHOUT COPD WITH AN ODDS RATIO OF 6.35 (95% CI: 3.9810.15). CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH THE PREVALENCE OF LUNG CANCER IN INDIVIDUALS WITH COPD IS LOW, IT IS GREATER THAN THE PREVALENCE OF LUNG CANCER IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. KNOWLEDGE OF THE CO-OCCURRENCE OF LUNG CANCER IN COPD WILL INFORM THE SCREENING OF LUNG CANCER FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE COPD. 2019","COPD; LUNG CANCER; PREVALENCE","CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE; CYTOLOGY; DISEASE EXACERBATION; HUMAN; LUNG CANCER; META ANALYSIS; NON SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER; PRIORITY JOURNAL; REVIEW; SPIROMETRY; SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","ENGLISH","REVIEW","ARTICLE",1,"DEPARTMENT OF RESPIRATORY MEDICINE, WEST PARK HEALTHCARE CENTRE WEST PARK HEALTHCARE CENTRE, 82 BUTTONWOOD AVENUE, TORONTO, ONTARIO M6M 2J5, CANADA; DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL THERAPY, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, 27 KING'S COLLEGE CIRCLE, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3H7, CANADA; DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, 27 KING'S COLLEGE CIRCLE, TORONTO, ONTARIO M5S 3H7, CANADA","10.1016/J.YRMEX.2019.100003","100003","BUTLER, S.J., UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO, 500 UNIVERSITY AVENUE, CANADA, EMAIL: STACEY.BUTLERUTORONTO.CA",NA,NA,"25901435",NA,NA,"W.B.

THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO IDENTIFY MEDICAL NEEDS AT AN EARLY STAGE OF THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND TO QUANTIFY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ENGINEERING CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENT RESEARCH FIELDS THAT CATER TO SPECIFIC IMPLANT REQUIREMENTS. THE METHOD IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE PERFORMANCE OF A SURVEY-BASED CONJOINT ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS INTEGRATED INTO A QUALITY FUNCTION DEPLOYMENT APPROACH. TWENTY-SEVEN MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND 29 BIOMATERIAL SCIENTISTS ASSESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF IDENTIFIED MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS, WHEREBY THE CONTROL OF MECHANICAL INTEGRITY AND DEGRADATION ALONG WITH NONTOXICITY AND NONIMMUNOGENICITY SHOWED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PREFERENCES. THE EVALUATION OF IMPLANT OPTIONS BY 31 EXPERTS INDICATED THAT THE ENGINEERING CHARACTERISTIC WITH THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE WAS THE CONDITION AND STERILIZATION OF THE SURFACE.

BY VARYING SUPERNATANT WATER LEVEL, EITHER FE(II) OR FE(III) IN THE FORM OF HYDROUS FERRIC OXIDES (HFO) COULD BE STIMULATED TO ENTER THE FILTER BED AT ALKALINE GROUNDWATER PH (7.6). THE EXPERIMENTAL PILOT COLUMN FILTERS SHOWED THAT ONCE THE AS(III) OXIDATION STABILISED IN THE TOP LAYER OF THE FILTER SAND, AS REMOVAL REACHED ITS MAXIMUM (75% AT 120 CM SUPERNATANT LEVEL AND 1.5 M/H FILTRATION VELOCITY). THE INCREASE IN SUPERNATANT LEVEL FROM 5 TO 120 CM RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL HFO PRODUCTION PRIOR TO RAPID FILTRATION (1.5, 5 AND 10 M/H), I.E. HOMOGENEOUS FE(II) OXIDATION AND FLOCCULATION, AND SUBSEQUENTLY, HFO ENDING UP DEEPER INTO THE FILTER BED (120 CM FILTER DEPTH). AT A LOW SUPERNATANT WATER LEVEL OF 5 CM, FE(II) OXIDISED HETEROGENEOUSLY AND WAS REMOVED WITHIN THE TOP 20 CM OF THE FILTER BED. CONSEQUENTLY, FILTERS WITH HIGH SUPERNATANT LEVELS REMOVED AS TO LOWER LEVELS (BY 20%) THAN IN FILTERS WITH LOW SUPERNATANT WATER LEVELS. THE BENEFITS OF FE(II) OXIDATION PRIOR TO FILTRATION FOR AS REMOVAL WAS CONFIRMED BY COMPARING FE(III) TO FE(II) ADDITIONS IN THE SUPERNATANT WATER OR IN THE FILTER BED. OVERALL IT IS CONCLUDED THAT IN BIOLOGICAL GROUNDWATER FILTERS, THE COMBINATION OF A HIGHER SUPERNATANT LEVEL AND/OR FE(III) ADDITION WITH BIOLOGICAL AS(III) OXIDATION IN THE TOP OF THE FILTER BED PROMOTES AS REMOVAL. 2018 THE AUTHORS","ARSENIC REMOVAL; FE(II)/FE(III) ADDITIONS; RAPID SAND FILTRATION; SUPERNATANT WATER LEVEL","ALKALINITY; AMMONIA; BIOLOGICAL FILTER BEDS; GROUNDWATER; IRON OXIDES; OXIDATION; POLLUTION CONTROL; SAND; WATER FILTRATION; WATER LEVELS; ARSENIC REMOVAL; AS OXIDATION(III); FE OXIDATION STATE; FILTRATION VELOCITY; GROUNDWATER TREATMENT; HYDROUS FERRIC OXIDES; RAPID SAND FILTERS; RAPID SAND FILTRATION; CHEMICALS REMOVAL (WATER TREATMENT); ARSENIC; FERRIC OXIDE; FERROUS ION; GROUND WATER; IRON; MANGANESE; METALLOID; AERATION; ARSENIC; BIOLOGICAL METHOD; CONCENTRATION (COMPOSITION); EXPERIMENTAL STUDY; FILTER; FILTRATION; OXIDATION; POLLUTANT REMOVAL; WATER LEVEL; WATER TREATMENT; ALKALINITY; ARTICLE; COMPARATIVE STUDY; CONCENTRATION (PARAMETER); CONTROLLED STUDY; FILTRATION; FLOCCULATION; METAL RECOVERY; OXIDATION; PORE VOLUME; PRIORITY JOURNAL; SAND; SUPERNATANT; WASTE WATER MANAGEMENT; WATER QUALITY","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",2,"DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, STEVINWEG 1, DELFT, CN 2628, NETHERLANDS; PIDPA WATER COMPANY, DESGUINLEI 246, ANTWERP, 2018, BELGIUM","10.1016/J.WROA.2018.100013","100013","GUDE, J.C.J., DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, STEVINWEG 1, NETHERLANDS, EMAIL: JINKTHALESWATER.NL",NA,NA,"25899147",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","1",2018,"none","DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY","DELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY",NA,"GUDE JCJ, 2018, WATER RES","GUDE JCJ, 2018, WATER RES"

IN THIS PAPER IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT MN-REDUCING BACTERIA PRESENT IN A BIOFILM ON THE FILTER MEDIA MAY BE A FACTOR IN THIS MN-RELEASE PHENOMENON. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF MN-REDUCING MICROORGANISMS IN THE RELEASE OF SOLUBLE MN FROM MNOX(S)-COATED FILTER MEDIA FOLLOWING INTERRUPTION OF PRE-FILTRATION CHLORINATION. BENCH-SCALE FILTER COLUMN STUDIES WERE INOCULATED WITH SHEWANELLA ONEIDENSIS MR-1 TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACTS OF A KNOWN MN-REDUCING BACTERIUM ON RELEASE OF SOLUBLE MN FROM MNOX(S) COATINGS. IN SITU VIAL ASSAYS WERE DEVELOPED TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO THE IMPACTS OF MNOX(S) AGE ON BIOAVAILABILITY TO MN-REDUCING MICROORGANISMS AND A QUANTITATIVE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (QPCR) METHOD WAS DEVELOPED TO QUANTIFY GENE COPIES OF THE MTRB GENE, WHICH IS INVOLVED IN MN-REDUCTION.

TYPHIMURIUM IN QUARTZ SAND WERE MONITORED IN MODEL POREWATER SOLUTIONS OF TWO DIFFERENT IONIC STRENGTHS (IS: 10 AND 100 MM KCL) AND TWO DIFFERENT HUMIC ACID (HA) CONCENTRATIONS (1 AND 5 MG/L). INCREASING NUMBERS OF FT CYCLES WERE FOUND TO DECREASE THE DEPOSITION OF S. TYPHIMURIUM ONTO QUARTZ SAND AND INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF DETACHED CELLS IN SAND-PACKED COLUMN EXPERIMENTS. BASED ON THE CALCULATED BACTERIAL ATTACHMENT EFFICIENCIES, THE PREDICTED MINIMUM SETBACK DISTANCES BETWEEN THE LOCATION OF WATER SUPPLY WELLS AND MANURE SPREADING ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHER WHEN THE EFFECTS OF FT ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. WHILE FT TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED CELL VIABILITY (IN THE PRESENCE OF HA), MOST CELLS WERE IN A VIABLE BUT NON-CULTURABLE (VBNC) STATE WITH COMPROMISED ABILITY TO FORM BIOFILM. THIS INVESTIGATION DEMONSTRATES THE EFFECTS OF SPRING TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS IN UPPER SOIL LAYERS ON S. TYPHIMURIUM PROPERTIES AND THE POTENTIAL INCREASED RISK OF BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION IN REPRESENTATIVE AQUIFER ENVIRONMENTS IN COLD CLIMATE REGIONS. 2018 THE AUTHOR(S)","BACTERIA TRANSPORT; CLIMATE CHANGE; FREEZE-THAW; GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION; PUBLIC HEALTH RISK; SALMONELLA","AQUIFERS; BIOFILMS; CHLORINE COMPOUNDS; CLIMATE CHANGE; CONTAMINATION; FERTILIZERS; FREEZING; GROUNDWATER RESOURCES; HEALTH RISKS; IONIC STRENGTH; MANURES; POTABLE WATER; POTASSIUM COMPOUNDS; PUBLIC HEALTH; QUARTZ; SALMONELLA; SAND; SOILS; TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION; THAWING; WATER SUPPLY; BACTERIA TRANSPORT; BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION; FREEZE-THAW; GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION; GROUNDWATER ENVIRONMENT; TEMPERATURE FLUCTUATION; TRANSPORT CHARACTERISTICS; VIABLE BUT NON-CULTURABLE; GROUNDWATER POLLUTION; DRINKING WATER; GROUND WATER; SURFACE WATER; BACTERIUM; BIOFILM; CLIMATE CHANGE; CONCENTRATION (COMPOSITION); FREEZE-THAW CYCLE; GROUNDWATER POLLUTION; GROWTH; POLLUTANT TRANSPORT; POREWATER; PUBLIC HEALTH; RISK ASSESSMENT; SURFACE WATER; TEMPERATURE EFFECT; ABSORPTION LAG TIME; ACCLIMATIZATION; AQUIFER; ARTICLE; BACTERIAL GROWTH; BACTERIUM CONTAMINATION; BIOFILM; CANADA; CELL CULTURE; CELL VIABILITY; CLIMATE; CLIMATE CHANGE; COLD; ELECTROPHORETIC MOBILITY; FREEZE THAWING; GROWTH RATE; IONIC STRENGTH; LONG TERM EXPOSURE; MANURE; NONHUMAN; PORE VOLUME; PRIORITY JOURNAL; PUBLIC HEALTH; SALMONELLA ENTERICA SEROVAR TYPHIMURIUM; SPRING; STRESS; WATER CONTAMINATION; WATER SUPPLY; WATER TABLE; WATER TEMPERATURE; WINTER; ANIMALIA; BACTERIA (MICROORGANISMS); SALMONELLA; SALMONELLA TYPHIMURIUM","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",1,"DEPARTMENT OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, MCGILL UNIVERSITY, MONTREAL, QUEBEC H3A 0C5, CANADA; DEPARTMENT OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, MCGILL UNIVERSITY, MONTREAL, QUEBEC H3A 0C3, CANADA","10.1016/J.WROA.2018.10.002","100005","TUFENKJI, N., DEPARTMENT OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING, MCGILL UNIVERSITYCANADA, EMAIL: NATHALIE.TUFENKJIMCGILL.CA",NA,NA,"25899147",NA,NA,"ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","1",2018,"none","MCGILL UNIVERSITY;MCGILL UNIVERSITY","MCGILL UNIVERSITYCANADA",NA,"ROCARD JM, 2018, WATER RES","ROCARD JM, 2018, WATER RES"

AMINO ACIDS ARE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS IN TARGETED FOODS FOR PAA TREATMENT AND UBIQUITOUS IN NATURAL WATERBODIES AND WASTEWATER EFFLUENTS AS THE PRIMARY FORM OF DISSOLVED ORGANIC NITROGEN. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE POSSIBLE REACTIONS, THIS WORK INVESTIGATED THE REACTION KINETICS AND TRANSFORMATION PATHWAYS OF SELECTED AMINO ACIDS TOWARDS PAA. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT MOST AMINO ACIDS SHOWED SLUGGISH REACTIVITY TO PAA EXCEPT CYSTEINE (CYS), METHIONINE (MET), AND HISTIDINE (HIS). CYS SHOWED THE HIGHEST REACTIVITY WITH A VERY RAPID REACTION RATE. REACTIONS OF MET AND HIS WITH PAA FOLLOWED SECOND-ORDER KINETICS WITH RATE CONSTANTS OF 4.6 0.2, AND 1.8 0.1 M1S1 AT PH 7, RESPECTIVELY. THE REACTIONS WERE FASTER AT PH 5 AND 7 THAN AT PH 9 DUE TO PAA SPECIATION. LOW CONCENTRATIONS OF H2O2 COEXISTENT WITH PAA CONTRIBUTED LITTLE TO THE OXIDATION OF AMINO ACIDS. THE PRIMARY OXIDATION PRODUCTS OF AMINO ACIDS WITH PAA WERE [O] ADDITION COMPOUNDS ON THE REACTIVE SITES AT THIOL, THIOETHER AND IMIDAZOLE GROUPS. THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS WERE APPLIED TO PREDICT THE REACTIVITY AND REGIOSELECTIVITY OF PAA ELECTROPHILIC ATTACKS ON AMINO ACIDS AND IMPROVED MECHANISTIC UNDERSTANDING. AS AN OXIDATIVE DISINFECTANT, THE REACTION OF PAA WITH ORGANICS TO FORM BYPRODUCTS IS INEVITABLE, HOWEVER, THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT PAA EXHIBITS LOWER AND MORE SELECTIVE REACTIVITY TOWARDS BIOMOLECULES SUCH AS AMINO ACIDS THAN OTHER COMMON DISINFECTANTS, CAUSING LESS CONCERN OF TOXIC DISINFECTION BYPRODUCTS.

RES.","CHEMICAL CLEANING IS ROUTINELY PERFORMED IN REVERSE OSMOSIS (RO) PLANTS FOR THE REGENERATION OF RO MEMBRANES THAT SUFFER FROM BIOFOULING PROBLEMS. THE POTENTIAL OF UREA AS A CHAOTROPIC AGENT TO ENHANCE THE SOLUBILIZATION OF BIOFILM PROTEINS HAS BEEN REPORTED BRIEFLY IN THE LITERATURE. IN THIS PAPER THE EFFICIENCY OF UREA CLEANING FOR RO MEMBRANE SYSTEMS HAS BEEN COMPARED TO CONVENTIONALLY APPLIED ACID/ALKALI TREATMENT. PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT CONFIRMED THAT UREA DID NOT DAMAGE THE RO POLYAMIDE MEMBRANES AND THAT THE MEMBRANE CLEANING EFFICIENCY INCREASED WITH INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF UREA AND TEMPERATURE. ACCELERATED BIOFILM FORMATION WAS CARRIED OUT IN MEMBRANE FOULING SIMULATORS WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CLEANED WITH (I) 0.01M SODIUM HYDROXIDE (NAOH) AND 0.1M HYDROCHLORIC ACID (HCL) (TYPICALLY APPLIED IN INDUSTRY), (II) UREA (CO(NH2)2) AND HYDROCHLORIC ACID, OR (III) UREA ONLY (1340 G/LWATER). THE PRESSURE DROP OVER THE FLOW CHANNEL WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE APPLIED CHEMICAL CLEANINGS. BIOMASS REMOVAL WAS EVALUATED BY MEASURING CHEMICAL OXYGEN DEMAND (COD), ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE (ATP), PROTEIN, AND CARBOHYDRATE CONTENT FROM THE MEMBRANE AND SPACER SURFACES AFTER CLEANING. IN ADDITION TO PROTEIN AND CARBOHYDRATE QUANTIFICATION OF THE EXTRACELLULAR POLYMERIC SUBSTANCES (EPS), FLUORESCENCE EXCITATIONEMISSION MATRIX (FEEM) SPECTROSCOPY WAS USED TO DISTINGUISH THE DIFFERENCE IN ORGANIC MATTER OF THE REMAINING BIOMASS TO ASSESS BIOFILM SOLUBILIZATION EFFICACY OF THE DIFFERENT CLEANING AGENTS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT TWO-STAGE CO(NH2)2/HCL CLEANING WAS AS EFFECTIVE AS CLEANING WITH NAOH/HCL IN TERMS OF RESTORING THE FEED CHANNEL PRESSURE DROP (&GT,70% PRESSURE DROP DECREASE). ONE-STAGE CLEANING WITH UREA ONLY WAS NOT AS EFFECTIVE INDICATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SECOND-STAGE LOW PH ACID CLEANING IN WEAKENING THE BIOFILM MATRIX. ALL THREE CHEMICAL CLEANING PROTOCOLS WERE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE CONCENTRATION OF PREDOMINANT EPS COMPONENTS PROTEIN AND CARBOHYDRATE (&GT,50% REDUCTION IN CONCENTRATIONS). HOWEVER, UREA-BASED CLEANING STRATEGIES WERE MORE EFFECTIVE IN SOLUBILIZING PROTEIN-LIKE MATTER AND TYROSINE-CONTAINING PROTEINS. FURTHERMORE, ATP MEASUREMENTS SHOWED THAT BIOMASS INACTIVATION WAS UP TO TWO-FOLD GREATER AFTER TREATMENT WITH UREA-BASED CHEMICAL CLEANINGS COMPARED TO THE CONVENTIONAL ACID/ALKALI TREATMENT.

RES.","VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF BLACK PEPPER ESSENTIAL OIL (BPEO) IN HUMAN CELLS. THEREFORE, IN THE CURRENT STUDY, WE EXAMINED THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF BPEO IN CYTOKINE-STIMULATED HUMAN DERMAL FIBROBLASTS BY ANALYZING THE LEVELS OF 17 IMPORTANT PROTEIN BIOMARKERS PERTINENT TO INFLAMMATION AND TISSUE REMODELING. BPEO EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT ANTIPROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY IN THESE SKIN CELLS AND SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED THE PRODUCTION OF COLLAGEN I, COLLAGEN III, AND PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR INHIBITOR 1. IN ADDITION, WE STUDIED THE EFFECT OF BPEO ON THE REGULATION OF GENOME-WIDE EXPRESSION AND FOUND THAT BPEO DIVERSELY MODULATED GLOBAL GENE EXPRESSION. FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT BPEO AFFECTED MANY IMPORTANT GENES AND SIGNALING PATHWAYS CLOSELY RELATED TO METABOLISM, INFLAMMATION, TISSUE REMODELING, AND CANCER SIGNALING. THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF BPEO IN HUMAN DERMAL FIBROBLASTS. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT BPEO POSSESSES PROMISING POTENTIAL TO MODULATE THE BIOLOGICAL PROCESSES OF TISSUE REMODELING, WOUND HEALING, AND METABOLISM. ALTHOUGH FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED, BPEO APPEARS TO BE A GOOD THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATE FOR A VARIETY OF HEALTH CONDITIONS INCLUDING WOUND CARE AND METABOLIC DISEASES.

MOREOVER, RESEARCH USING VARIOUS ANIMAL MODELS HAS FURTHER DEMONSTRATED THERAPEUTIC POTENTIALS OF NARINGENIN IN THE TREATMENT OF SEVERAL INFLAMMATION-RELATED DISORDERS, SUCH AS SEPSIS, FULMINANT HEPATITIS, FIBROSIS AND CANCER. THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF NARINGENIN IS NOT COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD BUT RECENT MECHANISTIC STUDIES REVEALED THAT NARINGENIN SUPPRESSES INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE PRODUCTION THROUGH BOTH TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL MECHANISMS.

THE POSSIBLE APPLICATION OF O. VULGARE EXTRACTS IN FISH WAS ASSESSED BY USING GILTHEAD SEABREAM (SPARUS AURATA) AS A MARINE FISH MODEL DUE TO ITS IMPORTANCE IN AQUACULTURE. THE IN VITRO EFFECTS OF AQUEOUS AND ETHANOLIC LEAF EXTRACTS OF O. VULGARE WERE TESTED IN ORDER TO OBSERVE ANY IMMUNOSTIMULANT, CYTOTOXIC, BACTERICIDAL OR ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES.

THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO DELINEATE THE PROFILE OF ACUTE-EXERCISE-INDUCED ISOPS LEVELS IN YOUNG AND OLDER ENDURANCE-TRAINED SUBJECTS. METHODS ALL INCLUDED SUBJECTS WERE MALE, YOUNG (N=6, 29 YRS 5.7) OR OLDER (N=6, 63.7 YRS 2.3), AND COMPETITORS. THE KINETICS OF F2-ISOPS IN BLOOD-SERA WAS ASSESSED AT REST, FOR THE MAXIMAL AEROBIC EXERCISE POWER (MAP) CORRESPONDING TO THE CARDIO-RESPIRATORY FITNESS INDEX AND AFTER A 30-MIN RECOVERY PERIOD. RESULTS NO SIGNIFICANT TIME EFFECT ON F2-ISOPS KINETICS WAS IDENTIFIED IN YOUNG SUBJECTS. HOWEVER, IN OLDER ATHLETES, F2-ISOPS BLOOD-CONCENTRATIONS AT THE MAP WERE HIGHER THAN AT REST, WHEREAS THESE BLOOD-CONCENTRATIONS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN REST AND AFTER THE 30-MIN RECOVERY PERIOD. CONCLUSION BECAUSE PLASMA GLUTATHIONE (GSH) PROMOTES THE FORMATION OF SOME F2-ISOPS, WE SUGGEST THAT THE SURPRISING DECREASE IN F2-ISOPS LEVELS IN OLDER SUBJECTS WOULD BE CAUSED BY DECREASED GSH UNDER MAJOR ROS PRODUCTION IN OLDER SUBJECTS.

THE VIRAL GAGPOL POLYPROTEIN PRECURSOR, AND THE HUMAN MITOCHONDRIAL LYSYL-TRNA SYNTHETASE (MLYSRS) FROM THE HOST CELL, HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PACKAGING PROCESS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE CATALYTIC DOMAIN OF MLYSRS IS SUPPOSED TO INTERACT WITH THE TRANSFRAME (TF OR P6) AND INTEGRASE (IN) DOMAINS OF THE POL REGION OF THE GAGPOL POLYPROTEIN. RESULTS: IN THIS WORK, WE REPORT A QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PROTEIN:PROTEIN INTERACTIONS BETWEEN MLYSRS AND ITS VIRAL PARTNERS, THE POL POLYPROTEIN, AND THE ISOLATED INTEGRASE AND TRANSFRAME DOMAINS OF POL. A DISSOCIATION CONSTANT OF 1.3 0.2 NM WAS DETERMINED FOR THE POL:MLYSRS INTERACTION, WHICH EXEMPLIFIES THE ROBUSTNESS OF THIS ASSOCIATION. THE PROTEASE AND REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE DOMAINS OF GAGPOL ARE DISPENSABLE IN THIS ASSOCIATION, BUT THE TF AND IN DOMAINS HAVE TO BE CONNECTED BY A LINKER POLYPEPTIDE TO RECAPITULATE A HIGH AFFINITY PARTNER FOR MLYSRS.

CONCLUSIONS: THESE DATA SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE COMPLEX FORMED BETWEEN GAGPOL, MLYSRS AND TRNA3 LYS, WHICH INVOLVES DIRECT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE IN AND TF DOMAINS OF POL WITH MLYSRS, IS MORE ROBUST THAN SUGGESTED BY THE PREVIOUS MODELS SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED IN THE PACKAGING OF TRNA3 LYS INTO HIV-1 PARTICLES. 2018 THE AUTHOR(S).","); BINDING AFFINITY; HIV-1; INTEGRASE; MITOCHONDRIAL LYSYL-TRNA SYNTHETASE; TRANSFRAME (TF OR P6; TRNA3 LYS PACKAGING","GAG PROTEIN; INTEGRASE; LYSINE TRANSFER RNA LIGASE; POL PROTEIN; PROTEINASE; RNA DIRECTED DNA POLYMERASE; TRANSFER RNA; VIRUS RNA; LYSINE TRANSFER RNA; LYSINE TRANSFER RNA LIGASE; POL PROTEIN; PROTEIN BINDING; ANIMAL CELL; ARTICLE; BINDING AFFINITY; ENZYME ANALYSIS; HUMAN; HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS 1; INSECT CELL; NONHUMAN; PROTEIN DOMAIN; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; PROTEIN PROTEIN INTERACTION; QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS; ANIMAL; ENZYME ACTIVE SITE; ENZYMOLOGY; GENETICS; HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS 1; METABOLISM; MITOCHONDRION; PHYSIOLOGY; PROTEIN PROCESSING; VIRUS ASSEMBLY; ANIMALS; CATALYTIC DOMAIN; HIV-1; HUMANS; LYSINE-TRNA LIGASE; MITOCHONDRIA; POL GENE PRODUCTS; HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS; PROTEIN BINDING; PROTEIN PROCESSING; POST-TRANSLATIONAL; RNA; TRANSFER; LYS; VIRUS ASSEMBLY","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",0,"INSTITUTE FOR INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY OF THE CELL (I2BC), CEA, CNRS, UNIV.

TO CIRCUMVENT THE USE OF EXPENSIVE AND INEFFICIENT PT CATALYSTS, MULTICOPPER OXIDASES (MCOS) HAVE BEEN ENVISIONED BECAUSE THEY PROVIDE EFFICIENT O 2 REDUCTION WITH ALMOST NO OVERPOTENTIAL. MCOS HAVE BEEN USED TO ELABORATE ENZYMATIC BIOFUEL CELLS (EBFCS), A SUBCLASS OF FUEL CELLS IN WHICH ENZYMES REPLACE THE CONVENTIONAL CATALYSTS. A GLUCOSE/O2 EBFC, WITH A GLUCOSE OXIDIZING ANODE AND A O 2 REDUCING MCO CATHODE, COULD BECOME THE IN VIVO SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY THAT WOULD POWER SOMETIMES IN THE FUTURE INTEGRATED MEDICAL DEVICES. THIS REVIEW COVERS THE CHALLENGES AND ADVANCES IN THE ELECTROCHEMISTRY OF MCOS AND THEIR USE IN EBFCS WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE LAST 6 YEARS. FIRST BASIC FEATURES OF MCOS AND EBFCS ARE PRESENTED. CLUES PROVIDED BY ELECTROCHEMISTRY TO UNDERSTAND THESE ENZYMES AND HOW THEY BEHAVE ONCE CONNECTED AT ELECTRODES ARE DESCRIBED.

THER.","HYPOXIA, THE MOST COMMONLY OBSERVED CHARACTERISTIC IN CANCERS, IS IMPLICATED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE NICHE. RECENT STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT EXTRACELLULAR VESICLE (EV)-MEDIATED CANCER-STROMA INTERACTIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE REGULATION OF VARIOUS CELLULAR BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, WITH PHENOTYPIC CONSEQUENCES IN RECIPIENT CELLS. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EVS AND HYPOXIA DURING CANCER PROGRESSION REMAIN LARGELY UNKNOWN. IN THIS STUDY, WE FOUND THAT EVS DERIVED FROM HYPOXIC LUNG CANCERS INCREASED M2-TYPE POLARIZATION BY MIR-103A TRANSFER. DECREASED PTEN LEVELS CAUSED BY HYPOXIC CANCER-CELL-DERIVED EV MIR-103A INCREASED ACTIVATION OF AKT AND STAT3 AS WELL AS EXPRESSION OF SEVERAL IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AND PRO-ANGIOGENEIC FACTORS. IN CONTRAST, INHIBITION OF MIR-103A BY AN MIRNA INHIBITOR EFFECTIVELY DECREASED HYPOXIC CANCER-MEDIATED M2-TYPE POLARIZATION, IMPROVING THE CYTOKINE PROLIFE OF TUMOR INFILTRATION MACROPHAGES. MACROPHAGES RECEIVED CANCER-CELL-DERIVED EV MIR-103A FEEDBACK TO FURTHER ENHANCE CANCER PROGRESSION AND TUMOR ANGIOGENESIS. FINALLY, CIRCULATING EV MIR-103A LEVELS WERE HIGHER IN PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER AND CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE M2 POLARIZATION. IN CONCLUSION, OUR RESULTS DELINEATE A NOVEL MECHANISM BY WHICH LUNG CANCER CELLS INDUCE IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AND PRO-TUMORAL MACROPHAGES THROUGH EVS AND INSPIRE FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF EV INHIBITION OR PTEN RESTORATION FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY.

ORIGANUM ELONGATUM PRODUCES AN EOS YIELDING AFTER HYDRODISTILLATION FROM 0.81% TO 3.12% BASED ON THE DRY WEIGHT OF THE ORIGINAL BIOMASS. 28 COMPOUNDS WERE IDENTIFIED, WITH A MAJORITY OF OXYGENATED MONOTERPENES AMONG THEM CARVACROL, THYMOL AND P-CYMENE CONSTITUTE THE MOST REPRESENTED COMPOUNDS. MOREOVER, A GREAT AMOUNT OF -TERPINENE, LIMONENE, THYMOQUINONE AND THYMOHYDROQUINONE WERE REPORTED IN SOME SAMPLES. FOUR CHEMICAL GROUPS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, NAMELY, CARVACROL, CARVACROL/THYMOL, CARVACROL/P-CYMENE AND THYMOL. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS OF THESE CHEMOTYPES APPEAR TO VARY SINCE THE CARVACROL CHEMOTYPE WAS THE MOST DISTRIBUTED, WHILE THE THYMOL WAS FOUND MORE ABUNDANTLY IN POPULATIONS FROM RIF.

SEPSIS PATHOGENESIS INVOLVES A DYSREGULATED INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE WITH CONSEQUENT PRODUCTION OF INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS AND REACTIVE SPECIES. THE PRODUCTION AND EXCESSIVE RELEASE OF THESE SUBSTANCES INTO THE SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION TRIGGER VARIOUS CELLULAR AND METABOLIC ALTERATIONS THAT ARE OBSERVED DURING THE DISEASE EVOLUTION. THUS, MORE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF PLANTS SUCH AS MORUS NIGRA L., POPULARLY KNOWN AS BLACK MULBERRY. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PLANTS BELONGING TO THE MORUS GENUS ARE RICH IN SECONDARY METABOLITES SUCH AS FLAVONOIDS WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPORTANT BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES AS ANTIOXIDANT AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIONS. BASED ON THIS CONTEXT, THE OBJECTIVE OF OUR STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTIOXIDANT PROPERTIES OF MORUS NIGRA L. IN A SEPSIS MODEL INDUCED BY LPS. MALE C57BL/6 MICE WERE DISTRIBUTED IN FOUR GROUPS: CONTROL, SEPSIS, SEPSIS TREATED WITH LEAF EXTRACT OF MULBERRY, AND SEPSIS TREATED WITH MULBERRY PULP. THE ANIMALS WERE TREATED WITH 100 L OF THEIR RESPECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR TWENTY-ONE DAYS. SEPSIS WAS INDUCED AT THE 21ST DAY WITH LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE (LPS) BY INTRAPERITONEAL INJECTION. THE ANIMALS WERE EUTHANIZED 24 HOURS AFTER RECEIVING THE LPS INJECTION. THE DATA OBTAINED WERE ANALYZED IN GRAPHPAD PRISM 6.0 SOFTWARE. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT TREATMENT WITH EITHER EXTRACT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED THE NUMBER OF LEUKOCYTES IN THE BRONCHOALVEOLAR LAVAGE FLUID AND SERUM LEVELS OF TNF IN SEPTIC ANIMALS.

ACTIVITIES OF THE ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, CATALASE, ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE, AND GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE, MONODEHYDROASCORBATE REDUCTASE, DEHYDROASCORBATE REDUCTASE, AND OTHER ENZYMATIC ACTIVITIES OF ASCORBATE-GLUTATHIONE CYCLE WERE ENHANCED FOLLOWING THE APPLICATION OF NO, AS COMPARED WITH THOSE IN UNTREATED SEEDLINGS UNDER CONTROL AND CADMIUM STRESS CONDITIONS. NO INCREASED THE FLAVONOID AND TOTAL PHENOL CONTENT IN CD-STRESSED TOMATO PLANTS. MOREOVER, NO APPLICATION RESTRICTED THE UPTAKE OF CADMIUM AND ENHANCED THE ACCUMULATION OF NUTRIENTS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF TOMATO PLANTS. ON THE BASIS OF THE FINDINGS OF THE PRESENT STUDY, WE PROPOSE THAT NO HAS A POTENTIAL ROLE AS A GROWTH PROMOTER FOR TOMATO UNDER CADMIUM STRESS. 2017, SPRINGER-VERLAG GMBH AUSTRIA.","ANTIOXIDANT; ASCORBATE-GLUTATHIONE CYCLE; CADMIUM; NITRIC OXIDE; OSMOLYTE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; TOMATO","ANTIOXIDANT; ASCORBIC ACID; CADMIUM; GLUTATHIONE; NITRIC OXIDE; CHEMISTRY; METABOLISM; OXIDATIVE STRESS; TOMATO; ANTIOXIDANTS; ASCORBIC ACID; CADMIUM; GLUTATHIONE; LYCOPERSICON ESCULENTUM; NITRIC OXIDE; OXIDATIVE STRESS","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",20,"DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY AND MICROBIOLOGY, FACULTY OF SCIENCE, KING SAUD UNIVERSITY, RIYADH, 11451, SAUDI ARABIA; DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY, S.P.

THEIR MAIN CONSTITUENTS ARE TERPENES AND PHENYLPROPANOIDS, WHICH ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR BIOLOGICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL PROPERTIES, SUCH AS INSECTICIDAL, PARASITICIDAL, ANTIMICROBIAL, ANTIOXIDANT, ANTI-INFLAMMATORY, ANALGESIC, ANTINOCICEPTIVE, ANTICARCINOGENIC, AND ANTITUMOR PROPERTIES. CANCER IS A COMPLEX GENETIC DISEASE CONSIDERED AS A SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM WORLDWIDE, ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 8 MILLION DEATHS ANNUALLY. OBJECTIVE: THE ACTIVITIES OF PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER AND THE MEDICINAL POTENTIAL OF ESSENTIAL OILS ARE ADDRESSED IN THIS REVIEW. CONCLUSION: SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED ANTI-CARCINOGENIC AND ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY FOR MANY ESSENTIAL OILS OBTAINED FROM VARIOUS PLANT SPECIES. THEY MAY BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTION TO OR IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL ANTI-CANCER THERAPY.

CELL. LONGEVITY","MODERN TECHNOLOGIES RELYING ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS HAVE BROUGHT INCREASING LEVELS OF ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD (EMF) EXPOSURE. THIS INCREASED RESEARCH INTEREST IN THE EFFECTS OF THESE RADIATIONS ON HUMAN HEALTH. THERE IS COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT EMFS AFFECT CELL PHYSIOLOGY BY ALTERING REDOX-RELATED PROCESSES. CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANCE OF REDOX MILIEU IN THE BIOLOGICAL COMPETENCE OF OOCYTE AND SPERM, WE REVIEWED THE EXISTING LITERATURE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF EMFS ON REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS. GIVEN THE ROLE OF MITOCHONDRIA AS THE MAIN SOURCE OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS), WE FOCUSED ON THE HYPOTHESIS OF A MITOCHONDRIAL BASIS OF EMF-INDUCED REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY. MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, AND SCOPUS DATABASE WERE EXAMINED FOR PEER-REVIEWED ORIGINAL ARTICLES BY SEARCHING FOR THE FOLLOWING KEYWORDS: EXTREMELY LOW FREQUENCY ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS (ELF-EMFS), RADIOFREQUENCY (RF), MICROWAVES, WI-FI, MOBILE PHONE, OXIDATIVE STRESS, MITOCHONDRIA, FERTILITY, SPERM, TESTIS, OOCYTE, OVARIAN FOLLICLE, AND EMBRYO. THESE KEYWORDS WERE COMBINED WITH OTHER SEARCH PHRASES RELEVANT TO THE TOPIC. ALTHOUGH WE REPORTED CONTRADICTORY DATA DUE TO LACK OF UNIFORMITY IN THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS, A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EMF EXPOSURE DURING SPERMATOGENESIS INDUCES INCREASED ROS PRODUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED ROS SCAVENGING ACTIVITY. NUMEROUS STUDIES REVEALED THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF EMFS FROM MOBILE PHONES, LAPTOPS, AND OTHER ELECTRIC DEVICES ON SPERM QUALITY AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR EXTENSIVE ELECTRON LEAKAGE FROM THE MITOCHONDRIAL ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN AS THE MAIN CAUSE OF EMF DAMAGE. IN FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS, THE CONTRIBUTION OF OXIDATIVE STRESS TO EMF-INDUCED DAMAGES AND THE EVIDENCE OF MITOCHONDRIAL ORIGIN OF ROS OVERPRODUCTION ARE REPORTED, AS WELL. IN CONCLUSION, MITOCHONDRIA SEEM TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS SOURCE OF ROS IN BOTH MALE AND FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS UNDER EMF EXPOSURE. FUTURE AND MORE STANDARDIZED STUDIES ARE REQUIRED FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF MOLECULAR MECHANISMS UNDERLYING EMF POTENTIAL CHALLENGE TO OUR REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PREVENTIVE STRATEGIES.

AN IMPORTANT POINT TO CONSIDER IS THAT ASCRIBING A SPECIFIC FUNCTION TO EVS IN GENERAL, OR TO SUBTYPES OF EVS, REQUIRES REPORTING OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION BEYOND MERE DESCRIPTION OF FUNCTION IN A CRUDE, POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED, AND HETEROGENEOUS PREPARATION. FOR EXAMPLE, CLAIMS THAT EXOSOMES ARE ENDOWED WITH EXQUISITE AND SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES REMAIN DIFFICULT TO SUPPORT EXPERIMENTALLY, GIVEN OUR STILL LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR SPECIFIC MOLECULAR MACHINERIES OF BIOGENESIS AND RELEASE, AS COMPARED WITH OTHER BIOPHYSICALLY SIMILAR EVS. THE MISEV2018 GUIDELINES INCLUDE TABLES AND OUTLINES OF SUGGESTED PROTOCOLS AND STEPS TO FOLLOW TO DOCUMENT SPECIFIC EV-ASSOCIATED FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES. FINALLY, A CHECKLIST IS PROVIDED WITH SUMMARIES OF KEY POINTS. 2018, 2018 THE AUTHOR(S). PUBLISHED BY INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES.","ECTOSOMES; EXOSOMES; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; GUIDELINES; MICROPARTICLES;

IN THE CURRENT STUDY, WE PRIMARILY EXPLORED THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF 10 ESSENTIAL OILS (NINE SINGLE AND ONE BLEND) IN A PRE-INFLAMED HUMAN DERMAL FIBROBLAST SYSTEM THAT SIMULATED CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. WE MEASURED LEVELS OF PROTEINS CRITICAL FOR INFLAMMATION, IMMUNE RESPONSES, AND TISSUE-REMODELING PROCESSES. THE NINE SINGLE OILS WERE DISTILLED FROM CITRUS BERGAMIA (BERGAMOT), CORIANDRUM SATIVUM (CILANTRO), PELARGONIUM GRAVEOLENS (GERANIUM), HELICHRYSUM ITALICUM (HELICHRYSUM), POGOSTEMON CABLIN (PATCHOULI), CITRUS AURANTIUM (PETITGRAIN), SANTALUM ALBUM (SANDALWOOD), NARDOSTACHYS JATAMANSI (SPIKENARD), AND CANANGA ODORATA (YLANG YLANG). THE ESSENTIAL OIL BLEND (COMMERCIAL NAME IMMORTELLE) IS COMPOSED OF OILS FROM FRANKINCENSE, HAWAIIAN SANDALWOOD, LAVENDER, MYRRH, HELICHRYSUM, AND ROSE. ALL THE STUDIED OILS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ANTI-PROLIFERATIVE AGAINST THESE CELLS. FURTHERMORE, BERGAMOT, CILANTRO, AND SPIKENARD ESSENTIAL OILS PRIMARILY INHIBITED PROTEIN MOLECULES RELATED TO INFLAMMATION, IMMUNE RESPONSES, AND TISSUE-REMODELING PROCESSES, SUGGESTING THEY HAVE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AND WOUND HEALING PROPERTIES. HELICHRYSUM AND YLANG YLANG ESSENTIAL OILS, AS WELL AS IMMORTELLE PRIMARILY INHIBITED TISSUE REMODELING-RELATED PROTEINS, SUGGESTING A WOUND HEALING PROPERTY. THE DATA ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE RESULTS OF EXISTING STUDIES EXAMINING THESE OILS IN OTHER MODELS AND SUGGEST THAT THE STUDIED OILS MAY BE PROMISING THERAPEUTIC CANDIDATES. FURTHER RESEARCH INTO THEIR BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF ACTION IS RECOMMENDED. THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF THESE ESSENTIAL OILS SUGGEST THAT THEY EXERT ACTIVITIES BY DIFFERENT MECHANISMS OR PATHWAYS, WARRANTING FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

RES.","OBJECTIVE: THE MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND 6 KINDS OF MEDICINAL COMPOSITION OF LEAVES IN ACER TRUNCATUM WERE ANALYZED TO PROVIDE THE REFERENCE FOR THE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DETECTION OF FLAVONOIDS AND PHENOLIC COMPOUNDS, DEVELOPMENT AND UTILIZATION OF LEAF TEA, AND SELECTION OF SUPERIOR CLONES IN A. TRUNCATUM. METHOD: THE MORPHOLOGICAL INDEXES OF THE LEAVES WERE DETERMINED BY CONVENTIONAL METHODS. THE MEDICINAL CONSTITUENTS OF THE LEAVES WERE DETECTED BY ULTRASONIC EXTRACTION AND HPLC. RESULT: THE VARIABILITY OF LEAF MORPHOLOGY WAS PETIOLE LENGTH &GT, LEAF LOBE WIDTH &GT, LEAF LOBE LENGTH &GT, LEAF LENGTH &GT, LEAF WIDTH &GT, LEAF BASE ANGLE. THE LEAF LOBE WIDTH WAS MOSTLY 2-3 CM. THE LEAF BASE-ANGLE WAS LESS THAN 180, EXCEPT FOR NO. 6-1. THE AVERAGE CONTENTS OF QUERCETIN, KAEMPFEROL, ISORHAMNETIN, CATECHIN, CHLOROGENIC ACID, AND CAFFEIC ACID IN LEAVES WERE 2 979.65, 1 474.92, 268.12, 1 380.18, 218.28 AND 8.13 GG -1 RESPECTIVELY. THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN THE PETIOLE LENGTH AND THE CHLOROGENIC ACID CONTENT IN THE LEAVES WAS -0.735 * . THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT OF TWO TESTED LEAF MEDICINAL MATERIALS BETWEEN MOTHER AND ITS ASEXUAL YOUNG PLANTS OF 'LUHONG NO.1' WAS 0.914 * . THE FLAVONOIDS CONTENT OF NO.6 SERIES WERE HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE OTHERS, WHILE THE PHENOLIC CONTENT OF NO. 1 SERIES WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE OTHERS. THERE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES OF MEDICINAL COMPONENT CONTENT AMONG DIFFERENT FAMILIES, EVEN DIFFERENT CLONES IN THE SAME FAMILY. CONCLUSION: THE INDIRECT SELECTION CAN BE USED FOR BREEDING LEAF SUPPLY LINES IN A. TRUNCATUM, FOR EXAMPLE, THE CHLOROGENIC ACID CONTENT OF LEAVES COULD BE IMPROVED BY SELECTION OF PETIOLE LENGTH. THE SELECTION OF HIGHER MEDICINAL CONTENT INDIVIDUALS AT YOUNG AGE IS FEASIBLE BECAUSE OF THE POSITIVE JUVENILE-MATURE CORRELATION OF LEAF MEDICINAL COMPONENT CONTENT. THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES OF THE LEAF MEDICINAL COMPOSITION AMONG CLONES IN THE SAME FAMILY REVEAL THAT INDIVIDUAL PLANT SELECTION IN THE FAMILY IS ALSO NECESSARY. THE LINE 'LUHONG NO.1' CAN BE CONSIDERED AS HIGH QUALITY STRAIN RESOURCE BOTH FOR MEDICINAL AND ORNAMENTAL USAGES DUE TO ITS LARGER LEAF, HIGHER CONTENT OF MEDICINAL MATERIALS, AND THE RED LEAF COLOR IN AUTUMN. 2017, CHINESE ACADEMY OF FORESTRY.

THE STRUCTURE OF THE MOCR REGULATORS IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE PRESENCE OF TWO DOMAINS: I) A N-TERMINAL DOMAIN, ABOUT 60 RESIDUE LONG, POSSESSING THE WINGED-HELIX-TURN-HELIX (WHTH) ARCHITECTURE WITH DNA RECOGNITION AND BINDING CAPABILITY, II) A C-TERMINAL DOMAIN (ABOUT 350 RESIDUE) FOLDED AS THE PYRIDOXAL 5-PHOSPHATE (PLP) DEPENDENT ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE (AAT) WITH DIMERIZATION AND EFFECTOR BINDING FUNCTIONS. THE TWO DOMAINS ARE LINKED TO EACH OTHER BY A PEPTIDE BRIDGE. ALTHOUGH STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION OF MOCRS IS PROCEEDING AT A FAST PACE, VIRTUALLY NOTHING IS KNOW ABOUT THE MOLECULAR CHANGES INDUCED BY THE EFFECTOR BINDING AND ON HOW THESE MODIFICATIONS INFLUENCE THE PROPERTIES OF THE REGULATOR.

HOWEVER, ITS OVERDOSE IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF ACUTE LIVER INJURY (ALI). MANY PREDISPOSING FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO SUSCEPTIBILITY TO APAP-INDUCED ALI. NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD), THE MAJOR CAUSE OF CHRONIC LIVER DISEASE, IS CONSIDERED AN IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF APAP-INDUCED ALI, ALTHOUGH THE EXACT MECHANISM CONTROVERSIAL. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS OF NAFLD ON APAP-INDUCED ALI. METHODS: TWO GROUPS OF MICE, NORMAL CHOW (NC) DIET-FED AND FAST FOOD (FF) DIET-FED MICE FOR 14WEEKS, WERE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO TWO SUBGROUPS: INTRAPERITONEALLY INJECTED WITH EITHER SALINE (NC-S AND FF-S GROUPS) OR APAP (NC-A AND FF-A GROUPS). BIOCHEMICAL TESTS, HISTOLOGICAL ANALYSIS, QUANTITATIVE PCR, AND WESTERN BLOTTING WERE CONDUCTED. RESULTS: ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE (ALT) LEVEL (199.039.0 VS. 63.87.4IU/L, P<0.05) AND NAFLD ACTIVITY SCORE (0 VS. 4.50.22) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN MICE IN FF-S GROUP THAN THOSE IN NC-S GROUP. ALI FEATURES SUCH AS ALT LEVEL (8447.81185.3 VS. 836.6185.1IU/L, P<0.001) AND CENTRIZONAL NECROSIS WERE PROMINENT AND MRNA LEVELS OF TRIB3 (RR, 1.81) WAS HIGH IN MICE IN THE NC-A GROUP. LEVELS OF CYP2E1 AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MOLECULES SUCH AS PPAR-, P62, AND NRF2 WERE HIGH IN MICE IN THE FF-A GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT WHILE THE FF DIET CLEARLY INDUCED NON-ALCOHOLIC STEATOHEPATITIS AND METABOLIC SYNDROME, NAFLD ALSO ATTENUATES APAP-INDUCED ALI BY INDUCING ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MOLECULES SUCH AS PPAR-. 2017 THE AUTHOR(S).","ACETAMINOPHEN; DRUG-INDUCED LIVER INJURY; NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE; PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR GAMMA","ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE; CYTOCHROME P450 2E1; MESSENGER RNA; PARACETAMOL; PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR ACTIVATED RECEPTOR GAMMA; SEQUESTOSOME 1; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NRF2; ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE; ANALGESIC AGENT; GAMMA INTERFERON; IMMUNOGLOBULIN ENHANCER BINDING PROTEIN; NFE2L2 PROTEIN; MOUSE; PARACETAMOL; PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR ACTIVATED RECEPTOR GAMMA; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NRF2; ALANINE AMINOTRANSFERASE BLOOD LEVEL; ANIMAL CELL; ANIMAL EXPERIMENT; ANIMAL MODEL; ARTICLE; BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS; CENTRIZONAL NECROSIS; CONTROLLED STUDY; DIET; DRUG INTOXICATION; FAST FOOD; GENE; HISTOLOGY; MALE; MOUSE; NECROSIS; NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER; NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE ACTIVITY SCORE; NONHUMAN; POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION; PROTEIN BLOOD LEVEL; QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS; TRIB3 GENE; WESTERN BLOTTING; ANIMAL; C57BL MOUSE; COMPLICATION; FAST FOOD; METABOLISM; NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PATHOLOGY; TOXIC HEPATITIS; ACETAMINOPHEN; ALANINE TRANSAMINASE; ANALGESICS; NON-NARCOTIC; ANIMALS; CHEMICAL AND DRUG INDUCED LIVER INJURY; FAST FOODS; INTERFERON-GAMMA; MALE; MICE; INBRED C57BL; NECROSIS; NF-E2-RELATED FACTOR 2; NF-KAPPA B; NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PPAR GAMMA","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",6,"KOREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE, SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA; KOREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LIFE SCIENCES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY, DIVISION OF LIFE SCIENCES, 145 ANAM-RO SEONGBUK-GU, SEOUL, 02841, SOUTH KOREA; KOREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF PATHOLOGY, SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA","10.1186/S12876-017-0680-Z","124","KOO, S.-H., KOREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LIFE SCIENCES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY, DIVISION OF LIFE SCIENCES, 145 ANAM-RO SEONGBUK-GU, SOUTH KOREA, EMAIL: KOOHOIKOREA.AC.KR",NA,NA,"1471230X","1",NA,"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD.","29179698","SCOPUS","17",2017,"none","KOREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE;KOREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LIFE SCIENCES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY;KOREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE","KOREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LIFE SCIENCES AND BIOTECHNOLOGY",NA,"KIM TH, 2017, BMC GASTROENTEROL","KIM TH, 2017, BMC GASTROENTEROL"

A DESIGN CRITERIA ARE ESTABLISHED, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE SIL MEMBRANES ARE PUNCHED TO AVOID COLLECTION OF FLUID UNDERNEATH. MANUAL PEEL TEST SHOWS THAT NATIVE SILICONE DOES NOT ATTACH TO THE FIBRIN/ALGINATE COMPONENT WHILE THE PLASMA POLYMERIZED SILICONE MEMBRANES ARE FIRMLY BOUND TO FIBRIN/ALGINATE. STRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION SHOWS THAT THE FIBRIN/ALGINATE MATRIX IS INTACT AFTER THE ADDITION OF THE SIL MEMBRANE.

HOWEVER, NOTHING IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS EFFECTS ON NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES, WHICH ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED OXIDATIVE STRESS LEADING TO LIPID PEROXIDATION AND THE FORMATION OF 7-KETOCHOLESTEROL (7KC) RESULTING FROM CHOLESTEROL AUTO-OXIDATION. AS 7KC INDUCES OXIDATIVE STRESS, INFLAMMATION AND CELL DEATH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY COMPOUNDS ABLE TO IMPAIR ITS HARMFUL EFFECTS. THESE COMPOUNDS MAY BE EITHER NATURAL OR SYNTHETIC MOLECULES OR MIXTURES OF MOLECULES SUCH AS OILS. IN THIS CONTEXT: (I) THE LIPID PROFILES OF DIETARY ARGAN OILS FROM BERKANE AND AGADIR (MOROCCO) IN FATTY ACIDS, PHYTOSTEROLS, TOCOPHEROLS AND POLYPHENOLS WERE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT CHROMATOGRAPHIC TECHNIQUES, AND (II) THEIR ANTI-OXIDANT AND CYTOPROTECTIVE EFFECTS IN 158N MURINE OLIGODENDROCYTES CULTURED WITH 7KC (25-50 M, 24 H) WITHOUT AND WITH ARGAN OIL (0.1% V/V) OR A-TOCOPHEROL (400 M, POSITIVE CONTROL) WERE EVALUATED WITH COMPLEMENTARY TECHNIQUES OF CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY. AMONG THE UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS PRESENT IN ARGAN OILS, OLEATE (C18:1 N-9) AND LINOLEATE (C18:1 N-6) WERE THE MOST ABUNDANT, THE HIGHEST QUANTITIES OF SATURATED FATTY ACIDS WERE PALMITATE (C16:0) AND STEARATE (C18:0). SEVERAL PHYTOSTEROLS WERE FOUND, MAINLY SCHOTTENOL AND SPINASTEROL (SPECIFIC TO ARGAN OIL), CYCLOARTENOL, -AMYRIN AND CITROSTADIENOL. - AND -TOCOPHEROLS WERE ALSO PRESENT. TYROSOL AND PROTOCATECHIC ACID WERE THE ONLY POLYPHENOLS DETECTED. ARGAN AND EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OILS HAVE MANY COMPOUNDS IN COMMON, PRINCIPALLY OLEATE AND LINOLEATE, AND TOCOPHEROLS. KIT RADICAUX LIBRES (KRL) AND FERRIC REDUCING ANTIOXIDANT POWER (FRAP) TESTS SHOWED THAT ARGAN AND EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OILS HAVE ANTI-OXIDANT PROPERTIES. ARGAN OILS WERE ABLE TO ATTENUATE THE CYTOTOXIC EFFECTS OF 7KC ON 158N CELLS: LOSS OF CELL ADHESION, CELL GROWTH INHIBITION, INCREASED PLASMA MEMBRANE PERMEABILITY, MITOCHONDRIAL, PEROXISOMAL AND LYSOSOMAL DYSFUNCTION, AND THE INDUCTION OF OXIAPOPTOPHAGY (OXIDATION + APOPTOSIS + AUTOPHAGY).

ANTICANCER THER.","INTRODUCTION: TAMOXIFEN, AS AN ESSENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TOOL IN THE TREATMENT OF ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-POSITIVE BREAST CANCER, HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR THE PAST THREE DECADES AND IS CURRENTLY BEING UTILIZED AS A CHEMO-PREVENTIVE AGENT FOR PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK FOR BREAST CARCINOMA. HOWEVER, THE INDUCTION OF CHEMO-RESISTANCE DURING THERAPY HAS INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE WITH REGARDS TO THIS AGENT. AREAS COVERED: THIS REVIEW ENUMERATES THE ROLE OF MUC1-C PROTO-ONCOGENE IN TAMOXIFEN RESISTANCE AND DESCRIBES A NUMBER OF SIGNALING PATHWAYS BY WHICH MUC1-C WOULD MEDIATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESISTANCE. FINALLY, RECENT CLINICAL STUDIES CONDUCTED ON THE MAGNITUDE OF MUC1 IN INDUCING TAMOXIFEN RESISTANCE ARE DESCRIBED. EXPERT COMMENTARY: MUCIN 1, OR MUC1, IS ABERRANTLY OVEREXPRESSED ON THE ENTIRE TUMOR CELL SURFACE OF MOST HUMAN CANCERS. THUS, IT MAY RESULT IN THE UPREGULATION OF SEVERAL SIGNALING PATHWAYS, SUCH AS GROWTH CASCADES RELATED TO RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES (RTK), -CATENIN AND E-CADHERIN, AS WELL AS PROMOTING GENE TRANSCRIPTION OF RAS-RELATED PROTEIN RAB-31 IN ORDER TO MEDIATE TUMOR GROWTH CONTROL IN RESPONSE TO TAMOXIFEN. ON THE CONTRARY, MUC1 SUPPRESSES APOPTOTIC EVENTS, WHICH IN TURN IMPRESSES UPON CELL FATE. ALSO, IT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THAT SILENCING MUC1-C PROTO-ONCOGENE IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO TAMOXIFEN-INDUCED GROWTH INHIBITORS. 2017 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP.","BREAST CANCER; CANCER PROGRESSION; ESTROGEN RECEPTOR; MUC1-C; MUCIN; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; TAMOXIFEN RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT","BETA CATENIN; CASPASE 3; EPIDERMAL GROWTH FACTOR RECEPTOR; ESTROGEN RECEPTOR ALPHA; MUCIN 1; NICOTINAMIDE ADENINE DINUCLEOTIDE ADENOSINE DIPHOSPHATE RIBOSYLTRANSFERASE; PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3 KINASE; PROTEIN BAD; PROTEIN BAX; PROTEIN KINASE B; PROTEIN TYROSINE KINASE; RAB PROTEIN; RAB31 PROTEIN; TAMOXIFEN; TRASTUZUMAB; UNCLASSIFIED DRUG; UVOMORULIN; ANTINEOPLASTIC HORMONE AGONISTS AND ANTAGONISTS; ESTROGEN RECEPTOR; MUCIN 1; TAMOXIFEN; APOPTOSIS; BREAST CARCINOMA; CANCER HORMONE THERAPY; CANCER RESISTANCE; CELL ADHESION; CELL FATE; CELL PROLIFERATION; ESTROGEN RECEPTOR POSITIVE BREAST CANCER; ESTROGEN RESPONSIVE ELEMENT; GENE OVEREXPRESSION; HUMAN; INTRADUCTAL CARCINOMA; MALE BREAST CANCER; PROTO ONCOGENE; REVIEW; SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION; WNT SIGNALING PATHWAY; BREAST NEOPLASMS; DRUG EFFECTS; DRUG RESISTANCE; FEMALE; GENE EXPRESSION REGULATION; GENETICS; METABOLISM; PATHOLOGY; ANTINEOPLASTIC AGENTS; HORMONAL; APOPTOSIS; BREAST NEOPLASMS; DRUG RESISTANCE; NEOPLASM; FEMALE; GENE EXPRESSION REGULATION; NEOPLASTIC; HUMANS; MUCIN-1; RECEPTORS; ESTROGEN; SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION; TAMOXIFEN","ENGLISH","REVIEW","ARTICLE",9,"RECOMBINANT PROTEINS DEPARTMENT, BREAST CANCER RESEARCH CENTER, MOTAMED CANCER INSTITUTE, ACECR, TEHRAN, IRAN; GENETICS DEPARTMENT, BREAST CANCER RESEARCH CENTER, MOTAMED CANCER INSTITUTE, ACECR, TEHRAN, IRAN","10.1080/14737140.2017.1340837",NA,"MAJIDZADEH-A, K., GENETICS DEPARTMENT, BREAST CANCER RESEARCH CENTER, MOTAMED CANCER INSTITUTE, ACECR, NO. 146, SOUTH GANDHI AVE., VANAK SQ., IRAN, EMAIL: KMAJIDZADEHRAZI.TUMS.AC.IR",NA,NA,"14737140","7","607-613","TAYLOR AND FRANCIS LTD","28597750","SCOPUS","17",2017,"none","MOTAMED CANCER INSTITUTE;MOTAMED CANCER INSTITUTE","MOTAMED CANCER INSTITUTE",NA,"MERIKHIAN P, 2017, EXPERT REV ANTICANCER THER","MERIKHIAN P, 2017, EXPERT REV ANTICANCER THER"

CHEM.","POLLUTION DUE TO HEAVY METAL(LOID)S HAS BECOME COMMON MENACE ACROSS THE GLOBE. THIS IS DUE TO UNPRECEDENTED FREQUENT GEOLOGICAL CHANGES COUPLED WITH INCREASING ANTHROPOGENIC ACTIVITIES, AND POPULATION GROWTH RATE. HEAVY METALS (HMS) PRESENCE IN THE SOIL CAUSES TOXICITY, AND HAMPERS PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. PLANTS BEING SESSILE ARE EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF STRESS AND/OR A NETWORK OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF STRESSES THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFE CYCLE. TO SENSE AND TRANSDUCE THESE STRESS SIGNAL, THE SIGNAL REACTIVE NITROGEN SPECIES (RNS) PARTICULARLY NITRIC OXIDE (NO) IS AN IMPORTANT SECONDARY MESSENGER NEXT TO ONLY REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES (ROS). NITRIC OXIDE, A REDOX ACTIVE MOLECULE, COLOURLESS SIMPLE GAS, AND BEING A FREE RADICAL (NO[RAD]) HAS THE POTENTIAL IN REGULATING MULTIPLE BIOLOGICAL SIGNALING RESPONSES IN A VARIETY OF PLANTS. NITRIC OXIDE CAN COUNTERACT HMS-INDUCED ROS, EITHER BY DIRECT SCAVENGING OR BY STIMULATING ANTIOXIDANTS DEFENSE TEAM, THEREFORE, IT IS ALSO KNOWN AS SECONDARY ANTIOXIDANT. THE IMBALANCE OR CROSS TALK OF/BETWEEN NO AND ROS CONCENTRATION ALONG WITH ANTIOXIDANT SYSTEM LEADS TO NITROSATIVE AND OXIDATIVE STRESS, OR COMBINATION OF BOTH I.E., NITRO-OXIDATIVE STRESS. ENDOGENOUS SYNTHESIS OF NO ALSO TAKES PLACE IN PLANTS IN THE PRESENCE OF HEAVY METALS. DURING HM STRESS THE DIFFERENT ORGANELLES OF PLANT CELLS CAN BIOSYNTHESIZE NO IN PARALLEL TO THE ROS, SUCH AS IN MITOCHONDRIA, CHLOROPLASTS, PEROXISOMES, CYTOPLASM, ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM AND APOPLASTS.

LETT.","BACKGROUND: THE WHEAT CYCLOPHILIN, TACYPA-1, SHOWS PEPTIDYL-PROLYL CIS-TRANS ISOMERASE (PPIASE) ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFERENT CYSTEINE RESIDUES IN REGULATION OF PPIASE ACTIVITY OF THIS PROTEIN HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. OBJECTIVES: THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT DISULPHIDE LINKAGES IN REDOX MECHANISMS THAT MODULATE THE PPIASE ACTIVITY OF TACYPA-1. METHOD: SITE-DIRECTED MUTANTS OF TACYPA-1 WERE GENERATED BY SUBSTITUTING CYSTEINE RESIDUES AT POSITIONS -40 AND -122 WITH SERINE AND -126 WITH PROLINE. THE RECOMBINANT PROTEINS WERE EXPRESSED IN ESCHERICHIA COLI AND PURIFIED. THE EFFECT OF CU2+ AND N-ETHYLMALEIMIDE WAS STUDIED ON PPIASE ACTIVITY OF THE PURIFIED RECOMBINANT CYCLOPHILINS FOR ANALYZING THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT CYSTEINE RESIDUES IN THE MODULATION OF ENZYME ACTIVITY. THE CHANGES IN SECONDARY STRUCTURE OF TACYPA-1 AND ITS MUTANTS WERE ANALYSED BY RECORDING FAR UV CD SPECTRA. THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT CYSTEINE SUBSTITUTIONS ON THERMOTOLERANCE OF E. COLI WAS STUDIED BY MONITORING THE CELL GROWTH AT 47 C AFTER 2 H, 3 H AND 5 H OF HEAT STRESS. RESULTS: THE CATALYTIC EFFICIENCIES (KCAT/KM) OF TACYPA-1C40S (0.37 X 106 M-1 S-1) AND TACYPA-1C122S (0.31 X 106 M-1 S-1) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AS COMPARED TO THE NATIVE TACYPA-1 (1.33 X 106 M-1 S-1), WHEREAS KCAT/KM OF THE DOUBLE MUTANT TACYPA-1C40S/C122S WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (2.36 X 106 M-1 S-1). COMPARED TO THE WILD-TYPE TACYPA-1, THE DIFFERENT MUTANTS ALSO SHOWED DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY TO CU2+. FURTHERMORE, THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ALSO REVEALED THAT DESPITE LACKING PPIASE ACTIVITY, THE MUTANT TACYPA-1C126P WAS ABLE TO CONFER PARTIAL PROTECTION AGAINST HEAT STRESS. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY REVEALED THAT MUTATION OF DIFFERENT CYSTEINE RESIDUES IN TACYPA-1 RESULTS IN DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT ON PPIASE ACTIVITY. IT WAS ALSO OBSERVED THAT OF THE TWO PAIRS OF CYSTEINE RESIDUES I.E. CYS40/CYS168 AND CYS122/CYS126, THE LATTER APPEARS TO PLAY MAJOR ROLE IN REDOX REGULATION OF TACYPA-1. THE MUTANT TACYPA-1C126P, THOUGH LACKING PPIASE ACTIVITY, WAS ABLE TO IMPART PARTIAL TOLERANCE TO HEAT STRESS IN E. COLI, SUGGESTING OTHER FUNCTIONS BESIDES CIS TO TRANS ISOMERISATION.

METFORMIN REDUCED DE NOVO LIPOGENESIS AND INCREASED THE EXPRESSION OF PROTEINS RELATED TO MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS, THEREBY INCREASING BETA-OXIDATION AND DECREASING LIPID PEROXIDATION. ALSO, METFORMIN UPREGULATED THE EXPRESSION AND ACTIVITY OF ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES, PROVIDING A DEFENSE AGAINST INCREASED REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES GENERATION. THEREFORE, A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN TRIGLYCERIDE ACCUMULATION IN THE LIVER, STEATOSIS AND LIPID PEROXIDATION WAS OBSERVED IN THE FM GROUP. IN CONCLUSION, FRUCTOSE INCREASES DE NOVO LIPOGENESIS, REDUCES THE ANTIOXIDANT DEFENSES, AND DIMINISHES MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS. AFTER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF FRUCTOSE INTAKE, METFORMIN TREATMENT, EVEN IN CONTINUING THE FRUCTOSE INTAKE, CAN REVERSE, AT LEAST PARTIALLY, THE LIVER INJURY AND PREVENTS NAFLD PROGRESSION TO MORE SEVERE STATES. 2017 THE AUTHORS","BETA-OXIDATION; LIPOGENESIS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; STEATOSIS; STEREOLOGY","ANTIOXIDANT; CHOLESTEROL; FRUCTOSE; INSULIN; MESSENGER RNA; METFORMIN; MOLECULAR MARKER; PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR ACTIVATED RECEPTOR ALPHA; PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR ACTIVATED RECEPTOR GAMMA; REACTIVE OXYGEN METABOLITE; STEROL REGULATORY ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN 1C; TRIACYLGLYCEROL; TRIPHENYLTETRAZOLIUM; ANIMAL EXPERIMENT; ANIMAL MODEL; ARTICLE; CALORIC INTAKE; CHOLESTEROL BLOOD LEVEL; CONTROLLED STUDY; ENZYME ACTIVITY; FATTY ACID OXIDATION; FATTY LIVER; FOOD INTAKE; INSULIN BLOOD LEVEL; INSULIN RESISTANCE; INSULIN SENSITIVITY; LIPID PEROXIDATION; LIPOGENESIS; LIVER INJURY; MALE; MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS; MOUSE; NONHUMAN; ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PRIORITY JOURNAL; WESTERN BLOTTING","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",12,"LABORATORY OF MORPHOMETRY, METABOLISM, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, BIOMEDICAL CENTER, INSTITUTE OF BIOLOGY, STATE UNIVERSITY OF RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL; LABORATORY OF MEMBRANE TRANSPORT, BIOMEDICAL CENTER, INSTITUTE OF BIOLOGY, STATE UNIVERSITY OF RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL; DOCTORAL PROGRAMING ON MORPHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSIDAD DE LA FRONTERA, TEMUCO, CHILE","10.1016/J.BIOPEN.2017.01.002",NA,"MANDARIM-DE-LACERDA, C.A., LABORATORIO DE MORFOMETRIA, METABOLISMO E DOENA CARDIOVASCULAR, CENTRO BIOMDICO, INSTITUTO DE BIOLOGIA, UNIVERSIDADE DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO, AV 28 DE SETEMBRO 87 FDS, BRAZIL, EMAIL: MANDARIM.CAGMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"22140085",NA,"19-30","ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","4",2017,"none","STATE UNIVERSITY OF RIO DE JANEIRO;STATE UNIVERSITY OF RIO DE JANEIRO;UNIVERSIDAD DE LA FRONTERA","UNIVERSIDADE DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO",NA,"KARISE I, 2017, BIOCHIM OPEN","KARISE I, 2017, BIOCHIM OPEN"

FOR THIS PURPOSE, 50 SPRAGUEDAWLEY MALE RATS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO 5 GROUPS: (1) CONTROL GROUP (CON, N=10), (2) SHAM (S, N=10), (3) ENDURANCE TRAINING (ET, N=10), (4) ENDURANCE TRAINING+VITAMIN E (ET+VE, N=10), (5) VITAMIN E (VE, N=10). ENDURANCE TRAINING PROTOCOL WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR 6 WEEKS, 6 DAYS PER WEEK, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OVERLOAD PRINCIPLE. TO MEASURE EXPRESSION CHANGES OF P53 AND PTEN GENES IN RATS' PROSTATE, REAL-TIME PCR METHOD WAS USED AND HPLC METHOD WAS USED TO MEASURE VITAMIN E IN THIS TISSUE. AFTER 6 WEEKS OF TAKING VITAMIN E, ITS LEVEL IN ALL GROUPS, EXCEPT FOR GROUP VE (P<0.000) DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE. AFTER IMPLEMENTING TRAINING PROTOCOL, P53 EXPRESSION REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY IN ET GROUP (P<0.026).

PROTEOMICS IS A HIGHLY USEFUL TECHNOLOGY FOR STUDYING PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND FOR DISCOVERING NOVEL PROTEINS IN UNSEQUENCED AND POORLY ANNOTATED ORGANISMS. CURRENT FUNGAL PROTEOMICS APPROACHES INVOLVE 2D SDS-PAGE AND EXTENSIVE, COMPLEX, PROTEIN EXTRACTION METHODOLOGIES. IN THIS WORK, A MODIFIED FOLCH EXTRACTION WAS APPLIED TO PROTEIN EXTRACTION TO PERFORM BOTH DE NOVO PEPTIDE SEQUENCING AND PEPTIDE FRAGMENTATION ANALYSIS/PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION OF THE PLANT AND HUMAN FUNGAL PATHOGEN LASIODIPLODIA THEOBROMAE. BOTH BIOINFORMATICS APPROACHES YIELDED NOVEL PEPTIDE SEQUENCES FROM PROTEINS PRODUCED BY L. THEOBROMAE IN THE PRESENCE OF EXOGENOUS TRIGLYCERIDES AND GLUCOSE. THESE PROTEINS AND THE FUNCTIONS THEY MAY POSSESS COULD BE TARGETED FOR FURTHER FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERIZATION AND VALIDATION EFFORTS, DUE TO THEIR POTENTIAL USES IN BIOTECHNOLOGY AND AS NEW PARADIGMS FOR UNDERSTANDING FUNGAL BIOCHEMISTRY, SUCH AS THE FINDING OF ALLERGENIC ENOLASES, AS WELL AS VARIOUS NOVEL PROTEASES, INCLUDING ZINC METALLOPROTEINASES HOMOLOGOUS TO THOSE FOUND IN SNAKE VENOM.

UNDER NACL STRESS, SEEDLINGS ARISING FROM NO-TREATED SEEDS SHOWED LOWER ACCUMULATION OF NA+ AND CL THAN THOSE SALINIZED SEEDLINGS ONLY, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH A BETTER GROWTH FOR ALL ANALYZED TIME POINTS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF CEO ON 17 PROTEIN BIOMARKERS THAT PLAY CRITICAL ROLES IN INFLAMMATION AND TISSUE REMODELLING IN A VALIDATED HUMAN DERMAL FIBROBLAST SYSTEM, WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO MODEL CHRONIC INFLAMMATION AND FIBROSIS. FOUR CONCENTRATIONS OF CEO (0.011, 0.0037, 0.0012, AND 0.00041%, V/V) WERE STUDIED. THE EFFECT OF 0.011% CEO ON GENOME-WIDE GENE EXPRESSION WAS ALSO EVALUATED. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: CEO AT A CONCENTRATION OF 0.011% SHOWED ROBUST ANTIPROLIFERATIVE EFFECTS ON HUMAN DERMAL FIBROBLASTS. IT SIGNIFICANTLY INHIBITED THE INCREASED PRODUCTION OF SEVERAL PROINFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS SUCH AS VASCULAR CELL ADHESION MOLECULE-1 (VCAM-1), INTERFERON -INDUCED PROTEIN 10 (IP-10), INTERFERON-INDUCIBLE T-CELL CHEMOATTRACTANT (I-TAC), AND MONOKINE INDUCED BY INTERFERON (MIG).

AMONG DIFFERENT COMPONENTS, GREEN TEA POLYPHENOLS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS MOLECULES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS SHOWED BY THE GREEN TEA AGAINST OXIDATIVE STRESS AND CELL INVASIVENESS. IN THIS STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF GREEN TEA POLYPHENOL EXTRACTS (GTPS) IN HUMAN GASTRIC MKN-28 CELL LINE. TO THIS AIM, WE HAVE FIRST EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF GTPS ON OXIDATIVE STRESS INDUCED CELL INJURY. THE PRE-TREATMENT WITH 104 M CATECHIN EQUIVALENTS OF GTPS EXERTS A PROTECTIVE EFFECT ON XANTHINEXANTHINE OXIDASE INDUCED CELL CYTOTOXICITY, THUS CONFIRMING THE ANTI-OXIDANT PROPERTIES OF GTPS. THE EFFECT OF GTPS WAS ALSO EXTENDED TO THE INVASIVE ABILITY OF MKN-28 CELLS STIMULATED WITH TNF- OR LPS, AS PRO-INFLAMMATORY FACTORS. MIGRATION AND MATRIGEL INVASION ASSAYS DEMONSTRATED THAT GTPS EXPOSURE (106 M) PREVENTS THE INCREASE IN CELL INVASIVENESS INDUCED BY TNF- OR LPS. FINALLY, WE HAVE ANALYZED THE EFFECT OF GTPS ON THE LEVELS OF MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES (MMP)-9/2, WHOSE EXPRESSION IS UP-REGULATED BY TNF- OR LPS. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE PRE-TREATMENT WITH GTPS WAS ABLE TO REDUCE MMP-9/2 EXPRESSION AT BOTH PROTEIN AND ENZYME ACTIVITY LEVELS IN THE CONDITIONED MEDIA OF TNF- OR LPS STIMULATED MKN-28 CELLS. IN CONCLUSION, OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT GREEN TEA POLYPHENOL EXTRACT REDUCES THE INVASIVENESS OF GASTRIC MKN-28 CANCER CELLS THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF TNF- OR LPS INDUCED MMP-9/2 UP-REGULATION.

HERE WE REPORT THE ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PORCINE NURR1 CDNA. THE NURR1 CDNA WAS RT-PCR CLONED USING NURR1-SPECIFIC OLIGONUCLEOTIDE PRIMERS DERIVED FROM IN SILICO SEQUENCES. THE PORCINE NURR1 CDNA ENCODES A POLYPEPTIDE OF 598 AMINO ACIDS, DISPLAYING A VERY HIGH SIMILARITY WITH BOVINE, HUMAN AND MOUSE (99%) NURR1 PROTEIN. EXPRESSION ANALYSIS REVEALED A DIFFERENTIAL NURR1 MRNA EXPRESSION IN VARIOUS ORGANS AND TISSUES. NURR1 TRANSCRIPTS COULD BE DETECTED AS EARLY AS AT 60 DAYS OF EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT IN DIFFERENT BRAIN TISSUES. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NURR1 TRANSCRIPT IN THE CEREBELLUM AND A DECREASE IN NURR1 TRANSCRIPT IN THE BASAL GANGLIA WAS OBSERVED DURING EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT. THE PORCINE NURR1 GENE WAS MAPPED TO CHROMOSOME 15. TWO MISSENSE MUTATIONS WERE FOUND IN EXON 3, THE FIRST CODING EXON OF NURR1. METHYLATION ANALYSIS OF THE PORCINE NURR1 GENE BODY REVEALED A HIGH METHYLATION DEGREE IN BRAIN TISSUE, WHEREAS METHYLATION OF THE PROMOTER WAS VERY LOW. A DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION IN A DISCRETE REGION OF THE NURR1 PROMOTER WAS OBSERVED IN PIG FRONTAL CORTEX DURING PIG EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT.

RHEOLOGICAL RESULTS SHOWED THAT INTEGRA (G=313.74 KPA) IS MECHANICALLY STRONGER THAN SMART MATRIX (G=8.26 KPA), DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE SILICONE BACKING LAYER IN INTEGRA. MICRO-PORES WERE OBSERVED ON BOTH DERMAL SCAFFOLDS, ALTHOUGH NANO-PORES AS WELL AS DENSELY PACKED NANO-FIBRES WERE ONLY OBSERVED FOR SMART MATRIX. AVERAGE SURFACE ROUGHNESS WAS HIGHER FOR SMART MATRIX (SA=114.776 NM) THAN FOR INTEGRA (SA=75.565 NM). BOTH SCAFFOLDS POSSESS A HIGHLY POROUS STRUCTURE (80-90%) AND DISPLAY A RANGE OF PORE MICRO-SIZES THAT REPRESENT THE ACTUAL IN VIVO SCENARIO.

OPEN","TOXIC HEAVY METALS SUCH AS CADMIUM (CD) AND COPPER (CU) ARE GLOBAL PROBLEMS THAT ARE A GROWING THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT. DESPITE SOME HEAVY METALS ARE REQUIRED FOR PLANT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, OTHERS ARE CONSIDERED TOXIC ELEMENTS AND DO NOT PLAY ANY KNOWN PHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE IN PLANT CELLS. ELEVATED DOSES OF CD OR CU CAUSE TOXICITY IN PLANTS AND GENERATE DAMAGES DUE TO THE STRESS CONDITION AND EVENTUALLY CAUSE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF CROP PLANTS. THE NITRIC OXIDE (NO) DONOR SODIUM NITROPRUSSIDE (SNP) IS REPORTED TO ALLEVIATE THE TOXICITY OF SOME HEAVY METALS LIKE CD AND CU. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, THE ROLE OF NO IN ALLEVIATING STRESSES OF CD AND CU WAS INVESTIGATED IN IN VITRO-GROWN TOBACCO (NICOTIANA TABACUM) BASED ON PLANT GROWTH, TOTAL CHLOROPHYLL CONTENTS, CONTENTS AND ACTIVITIES OF RUBISCO AND RUBISCO ACTIVASE. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY, THE GROWTH AND TOTAL CHLOROPHYLL CONTENTS OF CD/CU STRESSED PLANTS WERE HUGELY DECREASED IN THE ABSENCE OF SNP, WHILE THE SUPPLEMENTATION OF SNP RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF BOTH FRESH WEIGHT AND TOTAL CHLOROPHYLL CONTENTS. REMARKABLE REDUCTIONS OF RUBISCO AND RUBISCO ACTIVASE CONTENTS AND ACTIVITIES WERE OBSERVED IN CD AND CU-INDUCED PLANTS. SNP SUPPLEMENTATION SHOWED THE HIGHEST CONTENTS AND ACTIVITIES OF RUBISCO AND RUBISCO ACTIVASE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL AND CU/CD-STRESSED PLANTS. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SNP COULD PLAY A PROTECTIVE ROLE IN REGULATION OF PLANT RESPONSES TO ABIOTIC STRESSES SUCH AS CD AND CU BY ENHANCING RUBISCO AND RUBISCO ACTIVASE. 2016 THE AUTHORS.","CADMIUM; CHLOROPHYLL; NITRIC OXIDE; RUBISCO; RUBISCO ACTIVASE; SODIUM NITROPRUSSIDE","CADMIUM; CARBOXYLYASE; COPPER; NITRIC OXIDE; NITROPRUSSIDE SODIUM; RIBULOSEBISPHOSPHATE CARBOXYLASE; RUBISCO ACTIVASE; UNCLASSIFIED DRUG; ABIOTIC STRESS; ARTICLE; CHLOROPHYLL CONTENT; CONTROLLED STUDY; ENZYME ACTIVITY; FRESH WEIGHT; GROWTH INHIBITION; IN VITRO STUDY; NICOTIANA TABACUM; PLANT GROWTH; PLANT RESPONSE; PLANT STRESS; PRIORITY JOURNAL","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",14,"DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, KEIMYUNG UNIVERSITY, DAEGU, 42601, SOUTH KOREA; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE, GIMCHEON UNIVERSITY, GIMCHEON, 39528, SOUTH KOREA","10.1016/J.BIOPEN.2016.02.002",NA,"KHAIRY, A.I.H., DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, KEIMYUNG UNIVERSITYSOUTH KOREA, EMAIL: ALAIDRIS86GMAIL.COM",NA,NA,"22140085",NA,"41-51","ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","2",2016,"none","KEIMYUNG UNIVERSITY;GIMCHEON UNIVERSITY","KEIMYUNG UNIVERSITYSOUTH KOREA",NA,"KHAIRY AIH, 2016, BIOCHIM OPEN","KHAIRY AIH, 2016, BIOCHIM OPEN"

OPEN","COMPOSITE BIOMATERIALS MADE FROM SYNTHETIC AND PROTEIN-BASED POLYMERS ARE EXTENSIVELY RESEARCHED IN TISSUE ENGINEERING. TO SUCCESSFULLY FABRICATE A PROTEIN-POLYMER COMPOSITE, IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND HOW STRONGLY THE PROTEIN BINDS TO THE SYNTHETIC POLYMER, WHICH OCCURS THROUGH PROTEIN ADSORPTION. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO COST-EFFECTIVE AND SIMPLE METHOD FOR CHARACTERIZING THIS INTERFACIAL BINDING. TO CHARACTERIZE THIS INTERFACIAL BINDING, WE INTRODUCE A SIMPLE THREE-STEP METHOD THAT INVOLVES: 1) SYNTHETIC POLYMER SURFACE CHARACTERISATION, 2) A QUICK, INEXPENSIVE AND ROBUST NOVEL IMMUNO-BASED ASSAY THAT USES PROTEIN EXTRACTION COMPOUNDS TO CHARACTERIZE PROTEIN BINDING STRENGTH FOLLOWED BY 3) AN IN VITRO 2D MODEL OF CELL CULTURE TO CONFIRM THE RESULTS OF THE IMMUNO-BASED ASSAY. FIBRINOGEN, PRECURSOR OF FIBRIN, WAS ADSORBED (TEST PROTEIN) ON THREE DIFFERENT POLYMERIC SURFACES: SILICONE, POLY(ACRYLIC ACID)-COATED SILICONE AND POLY(ALLYLAMINE)-COATED SILICONE. POLYSTYRENE SURFACE WAS USED AS A REFERENCE. CHARACTERISATION OF THE DIFFERENT SURFACES REVEALED DIFFERENT CHEMISTRY AND ROUGHNESS. THE NOVEL IMMUNO-BASED ASSAY SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER BINDING OF FIBRINOGEN TO BOTH POLY(ACRYLIC ACID) AND POLY(ALLYLAMINE) COATED SILICONE. FINALLY, CELL STUDIES SHOWED THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE PROTEIN AND THE POLYMER HAD AN EFFECT ON CELL GROWTH. THIS NOVEL IMMUNO-BASED ASSAY IS A VALUABLE TOOL IN DEVELOPING COMPOSITE BIOMATERIALS OF SYNTHETIC AND PROTEIN-BASED POLYMERS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO BE APPLIED IN OTHER FIELDS OF RESEARCH WHERE PROTEIN ADSORPTION ONTO SURFACES PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE. 2015 THE AUTHORS","FIBRINOGEN; INTERFACIAL BINDING; POLYMERIC SURFACES; PROTEIN ADSORPTION","FIBRINOGEN; POLY(ALLYLAMINE); POLYACRYLIC ACID; POLYMER; POLYSORBATE 20; POLYSTYRENE; SILICONE; UNCLASSIFIED DRUG; ADSORPTION; ARTICLE; ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY; BINDING ASSAY; BINDING KINETICS; CELL CULTURE; CELL VIABILITY; CONFOCAL MICROSCOPY; CONTROLLED STUDY; EXTRACTION; HUMAN; HUMAN CELL; IMMUNOASSAY; IN VITRO STUDY; MATERIAL COATING; POLYMERIZATION; PRIORITY JOURNAL; PROTEIN BINDING; SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY; SKIN FIBROBLAST; SURFACE PROPERTY","ENGLISH","ARTICLE","ARTICLE",2,"RAFT INSTITUTE OF PLASTIC SURGERY, MOUNT VERNON HOSPITAL, NORTHWOODHA6 2RN, UNITED KINGDOM; INSTITUTE OF HEALTH AND BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION, QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, 60 MUSK AVENUE, KELVIN GROVEQLD 4059, AUSTRALIA; ALTRIKA LTD., THE INNOVATION CENTRE, 217 PORTOBELLO, SHEFFIELD, S1 4DP, UNITED KINGDOM; ADVANCED CENTRE FOR BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, GOWER STREET, LONDON, WC1E 6BT, UNITED KINGDOM","10.1016/J.BIOPEN.2015.10.001",NA,"GARCA-GARETA, E., RAFT INSTITUTE OF PLASTIC SURGERY, MOUNT VERNON HOSPITAL, NORTHWOOD, UNITED KINGDOM",NA,NA,"22140085",NA,"40-50","ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","1",2015,"none","RAFT INSTITUTE OF PLASTIC SURGERY;QUEENSLAND UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY;THE INNOVATION CENTRE;UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON","RAFT INSTITUTE OF PLASTIC SURGERY",NA,"SHARMA V, 2015, BIOCHIM OPEN","SHARMA V, 2015, BIOCHIM OPEN"

HOWEVER, THE FUNCTIONS OF CER ACCUMULATION IN NECROTIC CELL DEATH REMAIN UNKNOWN. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CLARIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CER ACCUMULATION WITH INHIBITION OF THE CONVERSION PATHWAY OF CER AND CONCOMITANT NECROTIC CELL DEATH. IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECT OF APOPTOSIS AGAINST NECROTIC CELL DEATH, A549 CELLS HAVING THE INHIBITING EFFECT OF CASPASE 9 BY SURVIVIN WERE USED IN THIS STUDY. CONSEQUENTLY, CER ACCUMULATION IN A549 CELLS WOULD LIKELY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A PATHWAY OTHER THAN THE MITOCHONDRIAL CASPASE-DEPENDENT PATHWAY OF APOPTOSIS. HERE, WE SHOWED THAT THE DUAL ADDITION OF A GLUCOSYL-CER SYNTHASE INHIBITOR AND A CERAMIDASE INHIBITOR TO A549 CELL CULTURE INDUCED PALMITOYL-CER ACCUMULATION WITH CER SYNTHASE 5 EXPRESSION AND NECROTIC CELL DEATH WITH LYSOSOMAL RUPTURE TOGETHER WITH LEAKAGE OF CATHEPSIN B/ALKALIZATION AFTER 2-3 H, ALTHOUGH IT IS UNKNOWN IN THIS STUDY WHETHER THE NECROTIC CELL DEATH WAS CAUSED BY THE LYSOSOMAL RUPTURE.

SALT CONCENTRATION AND THE CONTENT OF PHOSPHORUS, POTASSIUM, SODIUM AND CHLORIDE IN CULTIVARS OF G. WIGHTII (G. JAVANICA)","AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE","AUST. J. EXP. AGRIC.","ADAPTABILITY TO SALINITY STRESS WAS RELATED TO THE PRODUCTIVITY OF GLYCINE WIGHTII (G. JAVANICA) CULTIVARS BY THE TECHNIQUE OF COMPARING THE MULTIVARIATE CHARACTERISTICS OF RESPONSE FOR 22 ACCESSIONS THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WORLD CENTRES OF ORIGIN. ROOTS AND TOPS RESPONSES WERE COMPARED TO CLARIFY THE METABOLIC RELATIONS BETWEEN GLYCINES, AS SALINITY WAS INCREASED FROM THAT REQUIRED FOR NORMAL GROWTH AND METABOLISM TO LEVELS ALMOST CAUSING DEATH DUE TO EXCESS SODIUM CHLORIDE IN THE SUBSTRATE. THERE WAS A RANGE AND PATTERN OF RESPONSE THAT SUGGESTED GROUPING AMONG THE GLYCINES. ONE GROUP IN PARTICULAR WAS MORE RESISTANT TO SALINITY STRESS THAN OTHERS. THESE GLYCINES EXEMPLIFIED TO A GREATER DEGREE THAN OTHERS THE TENDENCY OF ALL TO EXCLUDE SODIUM AND TO A LESSER EXTENT CHLORIDE FROM THE PLANT TOPS. THESE WERE ALSO THE MORE VIGOROUSLY GROWING GLYCINES WITH A HIGHER POTASSIUM, PHOSPHORUS, AND NITROGEN CONTENT IN BOTH CONTROL AND SALINE TREATMENTS. IN THEM, VIGOUR OF GROWTH AND CONTROL OF ION CONTENT WERE ASSOCIATED, AND BOTH THESE FACTORS WERE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF TOLERANCE TO SALINITY STRESS. SODIUM APPEARED TO BE MORE TOXIC THAN CHLORIDE TO PLANT GROWTH. THESE ASPECTS OF GROWTH AND METABOLISM ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO DIFFERENCES IN PLOIDY BETWEEN THE GROUPS OF GLYCINES. THE TECHNIQUE USED SHED FURTHER LIGHT ON THE IMPORTANT AGRICULTURAL PROBLEM OF COMBINING ADAPTABILITY AND HIGH PRODUCTIVITY. 1970 CSIRO.
