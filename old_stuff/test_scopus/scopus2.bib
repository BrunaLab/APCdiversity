abstract={Packaging plays an important role in safely distributing products throughout today's society and supply chains. With a consumption of about 40% of plastics and 50% of paper in Europe, the packaging sector is a large user of materials. Packaging has a lot of environmental impacts, while it also represents a significant cost in the current supply system. Reusable packaging has been suggested as an option to significantly reduce environmental impacts. In this paper, we review the trends in reusable packaging and the literature on reusable packaging to generate insights into the current state-of-the-art knowledge and identify directions for research and development. This can help to better understand the key factors underlying the design and impacts of more sustainable packaging systems. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Aluminum water treatment residuals (Al-WTR), a waste product created during drinking water treatment, is generated in large quantities globally and typically landfilled; alternative, uses are desperately required. Inorganic phosphorus (P) is proven to be quickly and irreversibly sorbed by Al-WTR, rendering P unavailable for subsequent environmental use. However, little work has been done to characterize how Al-WTR interacts with organic P sources (e.g., wastewaters) to both sorb and later release P. Experiments characterized Al-WTR's ability sorb and subsequently desorb swine wastewater organic P, and to ascertain Al-WTR's potential for agricultural wastewater treatment and to return organic P to systems (e.g., soils) for beneficial use. Al-WTRs were shaken with swine wastewater (2.5:1;w/w) and solution total/inorganic/organic P were monitored over 21 days. The Al-WTR sorbed almost 100% (~ 16,500 mg kg−1) of swine wastewater organic P within a 1-h timeframe. X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy showed that P was primarily sorbed by Ca phases present in Al-WTR during the initial 1-h sorption phase. In a subsequent study, the newly generated organic P-laden Al-WTR was shaken in 0.01M KCl along with an anion membrane-probe to capture desorbed P. Approximately 17% (~ 3000 mg kg−1) of the organic P sorbed onto Al-WTR was desorbed. Findings suggest that Al-WTR can remove excessive organic P from agricultural waste streams, with the Al-WTR-organic P-containing material potentially having the ability to supplement agricultural soils with P for plant use. By following such an approach, this could provide municipalities with an alternative and beneficial utilization strategy as compared to landfilling. © 2020},

abstract={Rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS) are increasing in popularity because of their ability to alleviate water pressure on centralized systems, minimize or delay rainfall runoff, and fit relatively easily in both the centralized/decentralized infrastructure organization. Adequately sizing RWHS is critical to optimizing their operation because under-sizing results in systems that are unable to provide a sufficient, reliable source of water while oversizing increases the capital costs incurred with limited marginal benefits and poses potential water quality risks. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review to assess the state-of-art in the field of optimization of domestic rainwater harvesting systems. Sizing of storage is identified as the most important objective of optimization, yet sizing for cost is the most frequently implemented outcome of optimization. Optimizing for a local maximum is often favored over simulation-based optimization methods that produce global maxima. To derive more realistic sizing estimates, future optimization studies will have to take into account greater variation in water demands as well as various climate change scenarios, especially given that rainfall frequency and quantity are critical design variables of a rainwater harvesting system. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={The sharply increasing solid waste generation has raised the environmental concerns worldwide which currently have been escalated to a worrying level. Intending to eliminate the negative environmental impacts of solid waste and meanwhile promote sustainability on the energy- and resource-intensive construction and building sector, considerable efforts have been devoted to recycling solid waste for the possible use in sustainable construction material products. This paper reviews the existing studies on recycling municipal and construction solid waste for the manufacture of geopolymer composites. Special attention is paid to the predominate performance of these geopolymer composite products. The principal findings of this work reveal that municipal and construction solid waste could be successfully incorporated into geopolymer composites in the forms of precursor, aggregate, additive, reinforcement fiber, or filling material. Additionally, the results indicate that although the inclusion of such waste might depress some of the attributes of geopolymer composites, proper proportion design and suitable treatment technique could alleviate these detrimental effects and further smooth the recycling progress. Finally, a brief discussion is provided to identify the important needs in the future research and development for promoting the utilization of solid waste materials in the forthcoming sustainable geopolymer industry. In summary, this work offers guidance for the better ecological choice to municipal and construction solid waste through developing waste materials into highly environmental-friendly construction materials. © 2020},

abstract={Cascade use has been identified as a key concept towards the sustainable use of bio-based products aiming at the hierarchical utilization of biomass, first as materials; secondly recycled into new materials; and finally used energetically. This principle is plausible in theory. However, the quantification of economy-wide GHG savings due to the increased cascade use is scarce. Furthermore, another option to reduce GHG emissions – the extension of product lifetime – is not taken into consideration by this concept. This article aims at analyzing the potential of increasing the cascade use of wood products in Germany and contrasting the results with the extension of product lifetime. In doing so, we combine a disaggregated input–output model with a cumulative lifetime model. Results show that increased cascade use of wood products may reduce the current total GHG emissions in Germany at about 0.19% (1.68 ± 0.34 Mt CO2eq.). Lifetime extension seems not to have such a high reduction potential at about 0.04% (0.35 ± 0.06 Mt CO2eq.). Despite limited GHG reduction potentials of increased cascade use and lifetime extension, nevertheless, these concepts should be addressed by policy makers. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={In recent years, electrical and electronic products (e-products) have been central to the discussion of resource sustainability due to their growing demand, use of critical resources, and challenges in managing the resulting waste stream (e-waste). As such, the concept of circular economy, which seeks to ‘design out’ waste by better products, practices and business models, is deemed to be very relevant for e-products. The nature of circular systems mandates a collective effort of businesses, consumers, and governments. While the techno-economic sides of the circular economy have attracted large attention in recent years, the role of consumer behavior – a critical factor in defining the long-term success of ‘sustainable production and consumption’ initiatives – remains less explored. In this context, this paper explores the potential of integrating lessons from behavioral sciences to facilitate circular economy in e-waste management. It offers a review of prominent behavioral theories and their application in the context of sustainable consumption and pro-environmental behaviors. Finally, the paper identifies opportunities for behavioral interventions in improving e-waste management and in achieving a more circular economy. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={The market for solid-state lighting (SSL) systems has expanded 40-fold in installed lamps since 2001. At the same time, systems which preserve materials over time and promote material reuse are getting increasing attention in light of calls for reducing consumption of natural resources. As new lighting technology products are designed and brought to market, consideration must be given to how products will be managed throughout the life-cycle as well as their end-of-life (EOL) fate. Lighting-as-a-service (LaaS) business models have emerged as a potential strategy for preserving the materials embedded in lighting products. In this paper, we examine the cost and environmental implications of technology management decisions in the context of the street lighting industry, employing life-cycle assessment and a Markov Decision Process model. The goal of the research is to determine a policy that minimizes expected costs and emissions for the system over a fixed time horizon thus reducing uncertainty for managers. The model used in the paper evaluates the optimal replacement strategies for street lighting products and additionally connects the result to the optimal EOL product trajectory, taking both costs and carbon emissions into account. In doing so, we are able to more deeply understand the role that LaaS business models might play in enabling closed-loop systems within the street lighting industry. © 2019},

abstract={Car electronics form an extensive yet untapped source for secondary critical raw materials. To seize their recycling potentials it is imperative to understand how the number and volumes of car electric and electronic (EE) devices are affected by trends in: i) car typology, ii) penetration and integration of automobile electronic control systems (AECS), and iii) unit mass of EE devices. We used a layered dynamic material flow analysis (MFA) incorporating comprehensive data series to analyze the aforementioned trends and their influence on end-of-life mass flows of two automobile EE devices in Switzerland over the period 1975 to 2015. We found that there has been an increased penetration of the EE devices coinciding with a replacement of unifunctional devices by multifunctional ones (integration) and a decrease in their unit mass (downsizing). Both penetration and unit mass changed most rapidly in the 1990s and have flattened after the year 2000. Penetration outweighed integration and downsizing, so that before stabilizing, it caused a rapid increase in the mass flows of the EE devices. Due to the long lifetime of cars, changes in penetration, integration and downsizing are still evident at the end-of-life flows, but can be expected to slow down considerably between 2015 and 2025. The results demonstrate that monitoring of the trends at the car inflow, in combination with a dynamic MFA, can be used to anticipate changes in end-of-life flows 10–20 years before they occur and to timely inform recycling policies. © 2020},

abstract={Biomass is projected to play a key role in meeting global climate targets. To achieve a resource-efficient biomass use, European bioeconomy strategies increasingly consider the concept of a circular bioeconomy (CBE). We define the term CBE via a literature review and analyze the concept's role in north-west European bioeconomy clusters through interviews. We identify strategies regarding the clusters’ feedstock and product focus, and investigate what role biorefineries, circular solutions, recycling and cascading play. Finally, we discuss gaps in CBE literature and the potential contributions of the CBE to sustainability. The analyzed bioeconomy clusters move towards a CBE by increasingly considering residues and wastes as a resource, developing integrated biorefineries and focusing more on material and high value applications of biomass. However, there is so far only little focus on the end-of-life of bio-based products, i.e. on circular product design, recycling and cascading. Key challenges for implementing circular strategies are policies and regulations, costs and the current small size of bio-based markets. Amongst the product sectors the interviewees identified as promising for the bioeconomy, plastics and construction & building materials have most recycling and cascading potential. While the CBE could contribute to improving the sustainability of the bioeconomy, the concept is not inherently sustainable and its potential trade-offs need to be addressed. Especially social aspects, cascading, circular product design, and aspects related to product use seem to be underrepresented in CBE literature, while the topics biorefinery, wastes and residues as well as waste management are significantly covered. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={The existing building stock represents a huge accumulation of physical resources: a material ‘reserve’ that could be mined in the future to improve resource efficiency. However, in the absence of systematically collected information about materials deposited in the built environment, the ability to manage and exploit them is limited. An approach to quantification of material stocks based on the use of secondary data from external research bodies, national statistics and a housing stock management database is used to estimate the timber stock in residential buildings constructed in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets before 1992. Results show a total timber accumulation of almost 67,000 tonnes across 68,000 dwellings, with a material intensity for timber between 20−34 kg/m2 of building floorspace (6.8–11.2 kg/m3 of gross building volume) for terraced houses and 5.4−11 kg/m2 (1.8–3.6 kg/m3) for flats and maisonettes. Generally, there is more timber in floors and roofs, and in older buildings. This method appears to be robust, as it results in comparable timber intensities to those determined using other methods in previous studies. It can be used for other materials and may be useful in other contexts where data is available (i.e., other scales, building types and materials), and capable of contributing to the growing understand of existing buildings as material banks. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Renting instead of buying new products may be seen as the most efficient strategies of the circular economy. However, changes in the consumption inevitably liberates or binds scarce production or consumption factors such as raw materials, money and time which can potentially limit the potential to save resources. This phenomenon is known as environmental rebound effect and is currently under-researched in the context of resource sharing. This paper reviews the magnitude and tendency of environmental rebound effects of peer-to-peer boat sharing platform using a double-spending model (i.e. for lessors as well lessees). We found that environmental rebound effect was experienced by every lessee surveyed (n = 104) and in one-third of lessors (n = 29). 60 % of lessees experienced a rebound of over 20 %, losing one-fifth of the potential reductions in emissions through subsequent consumption behaviour enabled by the economic savings created by sharing resources. International air travel and increases in personal use of the boat were the biggest contributing factors towards environmental rebound effect. Users that increased consumption in these ways experienced a backfire effect in which their annual emissions actually increased. This backfire was experienced by 29 % of lessees with the worst scenario increasing emissions by a factor of over eight. We found statistically significant differences in the rebound of lessors and lessees. Greater awareness and non-economic mechanisms (such as symbolic rewards, information provision and nudging) tailored for lessors and lessees are needed to help prevent the likelihood of occurrence and the magnitude of environmental rebound effects from sharing resources. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={This study explores the motivations, opportunities, and abilities that consumers have for reducing food waste in everyday contexts that involve competing (food-related) goals. The framework of motivations, opportunities, and abilities is used to disentangle the complex array of factors that contribute to food waste. Results from 24 focus groups conducted in four European countries reveal that household food waste is the unintended result of balancing multiple competing goals. The results also indicate that abilities and opportunities influence the ease with which consumers can reduce food waste and act upon other goals (to which they assign greater value). These insights imply that, in addition to strengthening the importance that consumers attach to reducing food waste, interventions should focus on providing opportunities and abilities that will enable consumers to comply with multiple goals, including food-waste reduction. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Plastic debris is an ever-growing concern adversely affecting the coastal and marine ecosystem. Among marine plastic waste, a particularly troublesome waste fraction is Abandoned, Lost or Discarded Fishing Gears (ALDFG) that continues to trap marine life for years upon releaseand has significant adverse environmental effects on coastal and marine ecosystems. However, lack of scientific data on the estimated contribution of ALDFG to marine plastics and associated reasoning hinders the management of fishing gear resources across the globe. This study presents a system-wide analysis of the typical fishing gears used in Norway for commercial fishing, i.e. trawls, seines (Danish and Purse), longlines, gillnets, and traps. Based on data from gear producers, suppliers, fishers, collectors, authorities, and waste management facilities, we model the flows of plastics polymers, polypropylene, polyethylene, and Nylon, used as the building blocks of advanced gears. A static Material Flow Analysis (MFA) is used to understand life cycle processes and further monitor gear quantities in and between the processes in the system. Our findings indicate that commercial fishing in Norway contributes to around 380 t/yr. mass of plastics from lost fishing gears and parts. Gillnets, longlines, and traps are the main contributors to ALDFG in the ocean due to gear design, practice, and ground deployment. Additionally, around 4000 tons of plastic waste is collected in Norway annually from derelict fishing gears out of which 24% is landfilled, and 21% is incinerated for energy recovery. The MFA approach shows significant potential as a holistic decision support tool for industry and policy-makers in exercising sustainable fishing gear resource management. The study also generates key evidence on regional level plastic pollution from the fishing sector and highlights possible mechanisms that may aid in proposed improvements. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The long-term supply sustainability of copper, zinc and lead was assessed. Copper will not run into physcal scarcity in the future, but increased demand and decreased resource quality will cause significant price increases. The copper price is suggested to increase significantly in the coming decades. A similar situation applies for zinc and lead with soft scarcity and increased prices for zinc. The total supply of copper reaches a maximum 2030–2045, zinc 2030–2050 and lead 2025-2030. The copper supply per person and year and decline after 2130, and the copper stock-in-use reaches a maximum in 2050 and decline afterwards. The zinc supply per person per year reach a maximum in 2100 and decline after 2100, and the zinc stock-in use shows a similar pattern. The lead supply per person reach a plateau in 1985, and decline after 2070, whereas the lead stock-in-use reach a plateau in 2080 and decline after 2100. For copper, zinc and lead, scarcity will mainly be manifested as increased metal price, with feedbacks on demand. The predicted price increase will cause recycling to increase in the future. The supply situation for copper would be much improved if the recycling of copper could be strongly promoted through policy means, as well as it would work well to limit the price increases predicted under business-as-usual. Considering the importance of these metals for society, it is essential to set adequate policies for resource efficiency and resource conservation for society. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Onsite (a.k.a. decentralized) water reuse can reduce overall potable water demand and aid in meeting water reduction goals. In spite of clear benefits, onsite non-potable water systems (ONWS), specifically non-blackwater commercial systems, face many challenges that are preventing growth and expansion in California. This study utilized a technical advisory committee and a survey to identify the most significant challenges facing onsite water reuse systems, how these challenges affect ONWS stakeholders, and potential solutions at the state level. The given methods found that the most prevalent challenges hindering the growth of ONWS appeared to be the absence of a local regulatory program, system cost, poor access to training for regulators, and limited public education about alternate water sources. Survey results revealed several possible drivers for the existence of these challenges including that informational and training resources are not adequately disseminated to target groups. The study concluded that the creation of trainings for regulators, the development of an organization dedicated to onsite systems, expanded technology certifications, policy changes, and highlighting existing systems might help overcome the challenges hindering growth and allow for greater expansion of onsite non-potable water systems throughout California. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={One innovation developed to tackle food waste in professional catering units is different versions of smart scales and softwares designed to simplify food waste quantification. The intention with this is to managing meal production more efficiently based on previous outcomes. However, quantification can be performed in different ways and having a catering unit quantify its food waste does not necessarily guarantee a reduction. Therefore this study sought to identify factors that could make food waste quantification more efficient in terms of waste reduction, and to determine the waste reduction payoff from more ambitious quantification set-ups. Data on 735 hotels, restaurants, and canteens in Europe, especially Sweden and Norway, that use a spreadsheet, a dedicated scale, or an internet-based service to track food waste were analyzed and parameters describing initial waste, number of guests and length, resolution, and completeness of quantification were determined. These parameters were then compared against the waste reduction achieved, in order to test their influence. It was found that 61% of the catering units studied had reduced their waste and that initial mass of waste per guest was the most influential factor for waste reduction. Catering units using more automated quantification tools recorded more data and reduced their food waste by slightly more, but also had a higher level of initial waste and therefore a greater opportunity for reduction. From this, it can be concluded that prioritizing catering units with the greatest waste volume could be an efficient strategy to reduce overall food waste in the most cost-efficient way. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The large variety and amounts of plastic waste produced worldwide requires to better organize the industrial network devoted to the exploitation of this material by including different processes that allow to recover the “material” as main target. This paper presents the results of the feasibility study developed for an integrated system for plastic waste management designed in such a way to deal with the real market and provide for reliable targets in term of material recovery yields, energy efficiency and waste minimization. The system under study is a combination of mechanical sorting, thermochemical processes and conversion into materials and energy. The quantified block diagrams are used to represent the mass and feedstock energy balances by allowing the calculation of yields of given products. The equipment list for each sub-system is provided together with the installed power for the main component and/or auxiliary; these data allowed to perform the energy balance and to obtain the net energy production by the integrated system. The energy balance demonstrated that the integrated system is feasible while, on the contrary, the single processes are not energetic self-sustainable. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={The cement industry in China has been conducting overcapacity elimination through technology upgrading in the past years. Most of the overcapacity elimination policies are in the form of administrative and regulative approaches. However, the cost of overcapacity elimination by implementing command-and-control policies will be increasingly higher, at the same time, the orientation of such technology upgrading remains unknown. Such contradiction creates the necessities to reveal the impact of other policy instruments on the technology upgrading in the cement industry, as well as to clarify the optimal output allocation among all alternative technology choices. In this paper, an LCA-RCOT model (Life Cycle Assessment and Rectangular Choices Of Technologies) is established to provide such optimal technology combination with the constraints from a projected emission trading scheme (ETS). The results show that under an ETS cap with a target of 5% reduction of emission, 10% of subsidy allowances, and one-way linking with another ETS with higher average market price, the optimal solution suggest that 114.5 billion USD of total output in the cement sector should be produced by small dry kilns, while 102.5 billion USD by large dry kilns. In all feasible solutions, the optimal technology combination may shift to fewer shaft kilns and more dry kilns. In the long run, the climate policy instrument, ETS, may promote the upgrading of production technology by decomposing the total emission mitigation costs to the factor inputs of each cement producer. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={To reduce environmental issues resulting from excess nutrients, conserve valuable resources and safeguard future food security, natural nutrient cycles in agro-food-waste systems need to be restored. To this end, nutrient stock and flow analyses of the agro-food-waste system can be undertaken. There is currently no standardized method for the systematic analysis of nutrient stocks and flows to support nutrient circularity of those systems at a local scale. This review of 57 studies summarizes the current knowledge on nutrient stock and flow analysis of agro-food-waste systems in local areas and proposes a six-step framework. About a third of the reviewed studies analyzed the complete agro-food-waste system, including crop production, animal production, food and feed processing industry, consumption and waste management. Furthermore, the main focus tends to be on phosphorus (P), and to a lesser extent on nitrogen (N), potassium (K) and (organic) carbon (C). Only a few studies combined the analyses of different nutrients, even though nutrient use efficiency relies on obtaining the optimal stoichiometric balance. The proposed framework for nutrient stock and flow analyses encompasses the inclusion of the complete agro-food-waste system and simultaneous analysis of N, P, K and C to facilitate assessment of the full potential to restore local nutrient circularity. Moreover, the local study area needs to be sufficiently large to include all the subsystems and sufficiently small to facilitate transportation of nutrients. Following this six-step framework, analyses will be able to identify hotspots, based on which effective measures to restore local nutrient circularity can be developed. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Anaerobic digestate originating from food waste has been studied herein for two different purposes. Firstly, for combustion, co-granulation of the digestate and medium density fibreboard (MDF) dust with the addition of sodium silicate as the binder was used to produce the granular solid biofuel. It was found that increasing the content of the medium density fibreboard dust could increase the calorific value but had no significant effect on the strength of the final granules. Additionally, a significant reduction of the ash content was also observed. For heavy metal removal, granules made using the digestate and sodium silicate binder were carbonised to produce biochar which was characterised and applied as adsorbent materials. The biochar has a good removal capacity for both lead and cadmium, and the binder concentration had a positive correlation with the removal capacity of the resultant biochar. The maximum lead removal capacity (355.3 mg g−1) of biochar made using 3 wt.% sodium silicate binder, was six times more than the analogous commercial activated carbon. Langmuir model showed better fitting for adsorption data of Pb2+, while the Freundlich model showed better fitting of Cd2+. For both Pb2+ and Cd2+ kinetic data, the pseudo-second-order had a better correlation. Our approach helps aid and facilitate the concept of the circular economy by effectively up-cycling and valorising waste lignocellulosic biomass such as food waste digestate into value-added products. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Freshwater ecosystems worldwide are at risk of becoming degraded as a result of excessive inputs of phosphorus (P) associated with terrestrial activities. This study describes a novel methodology to rapidly assess the potential of low-cost adsorbents which might be used to combat this issue. The ability of aluminum drinking water treatment residual (Al-WTR) and crushed concrete (CC) to remove P from dairy wastewater (DW) and forestry runoff (wastewaters representative of point and nonpoint P pollution sources, respectively) was assessed. In addition to predicting the longevity of these media in large-scale filters, potential risks associated with their use were also examined. The results indicate that both CC and Al-WTR show promise for use in removing P from forestry runoff, however the raised pH of effluent from CC filters may pose an environmental concern. Al-WTR showed greater promise than CC for the treatment of DW due to its higher adsorption capacity at high concentrations. Small releases of aluminum (13.63-96.17 μg g−1) and copper (5.25-31.9 μg g−1) were observed from both media when treating forestry runoff, and Al-WTR also released a small amount of nickel (0.16 μg g−1). Approximately 50% of total metal loss occurred during the first 25% of total filter loading, indicating that pre-washing of the media would help prevent metal release. These results indicate that field-scale tests are warranted for the treatment of both wastewaters with Al-WTR; CC is likely to be unsuitable for either forestry runoff or DW due to its effects on pH and its short lifespan. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Assessing the sustainability of waste management systems (WMSs) is key to reduce the impacts incurred by human activities. The article presents the development of an operational sustainability framework for the assessment of WMSs involving stakeholders and experts from different fields. The operational framework presented achieves comprehensiveness by including multidisciplinary impacts (environmental, social, and economic impacts), accounting for spatial differentiation regarding the occurrence and magnitude of the impacts (local to global) and complementing well-established methods in life cycle assessment (LCA) with local impact assessment methods. In this respect, the assessment of social local impacts (e.g., Odour, Landscape Disamenities), which has so far received little attention in the literature, has been included. The procedure for the definition of the operational framework is described in detail, including the selection of the impact categories and associated indicators. Finally, an aggregation method was defined considering the perception of stakeholders, allowing for aggregating the impact in five areas of protection (Prosperity, Human Well-Being, Human Health, Ecosystem Health and Natural Resources). © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={This paper reports on research undertaken to identify generic and specific barriers to reuse of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). Thirty semi-structured interviews were conducted with experts from across the value chain including product designers, manufacturers, users and waste managers as well policy makers and academics. The interviews sought to examine perceived and real barriers to reuse in the UK. Three inter-connected factors that limit opportunities and instances of reuse of electrical and electronic equipment were identified, highlighting that both systemic and consumer barriers to increasing levels of reuse exist. These are: producer reluctance, unsuitable collection infrastructure and cultural issues. Overall, the paper shows that low levels of reuse in the electrical and electronic sector are a result of complex and interlinked barriers. Understanding these connections offers the potential to improve the opportunities for reuse, by providing direction for policy makers to address barriers from a multi stakeholder perspective. Increasing instances of reuse is essential if the UK is to successfully move towards a resource efficient, circular economy. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={To improve air quality and protect public health, the State Council of China issued the National Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (‘the Action Plan’) in 2013. Specific measures were designed in the Action Plan to reduce emissions of atmospheric pollutants, with core contents in energy related measures. Implementing these measures would potentially have significant co-benefits on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study quantitatively analyzes the impacts of the different measures in the Action Plan on the emissions of major air pollutants of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), particulate matter (PM) and CO2 in the Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ, i.e., Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei) region using the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies model (GAINS)-China model. The results show that the Action Plan in JJJ would reduce 47.3 ± 0.8% of SO2, 32.5 ± 2.6% of NOx, 15.2 ± 0.2% of PM2.5, and 39.9 ± 5.3% CO2 emissions, compared to the emissions in 2012. PM2.5 emission reduction has the highest co-benefit for CO2 reduction in JJJ, and also in Tianjin and Hebei. In Beijing, NOx emission reduction has high co-benefit for CO2 reduction, when considering the relative degree of co-benefit. Among the different source sectors, industrial and residential sectors are identified to be the source sectors that contribute the most to the co-benefit of CO2 emission reduction in JJJ. The results suggest that implementing energy replacement in the industrial and residential sectors in JJJ can not only generate large amounts of air pollutants emission reduction, but also can lead to significant CO2 emission reduction. © 2019},
