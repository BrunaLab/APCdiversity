abstract={Chaotic system has been widely used in the design of pseudorandom sequence generators. However, the performance of pseudorandom sequence generators is greatly affected by the chaotic degradation, which is caused by computational accuracy. In this paper, we propose a self-perturbed pseudorandom sequence generator based on hyper-chaotic system to overcome this problem. A novel hyper-chaotic system is constructed to achieve a complex dynamic behavior. One of the feedback controllers is used to disturb the other dimensions so that the short period can be avoided. Based on the proposed hyper-chaotic system, a pseudorandom number generator is designed. The dynamic behavior of the hyper-chaotic system is analyzed. The randomness and the security of the pseudorandom sequence generated by the proposed scheme are tested and analyzed. The results show that this scheme has a larger key space and a higher level of randomness. It is suitable to be used in privacy encryption and secure communication. © 2020 The Author(s)},
