abstract={Evidence suggests that adolescent pregnancies are at increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes compared to adult pregnancies; however, there are significant inconsistencies in the literature, particularly in studies conducted in developed countries. The objective of this study therefore is to systematically review the current literature with regard to the relationship between adolescent pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. A literature search was conducted in eight electronic databases (AMED, ASSIA, Child Development and Adolescent Studies, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Health Source: Nursing, Maternity and Infant Care, MEDLINE and Scopus. The reference lists of included studies were also hand searched. Studies were included if: they were conducted in countries with very high human development according to the United Nations Human Development Index; reported at least one comparison between adolescents (19 years or under) and adult mothers (20–34 years); and were published between January 1998 and March 2018. Studies were screened for inclusion and data extracted by one reviewer. A second reviewer independently reviewed a sub-set of studies. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 using crude counts reported in the included studies. Sub-group analyses of adolescents aged 17 and under and 18–19 were conducted. Pooled analysis of adjusted odds ratios was also undertaken in order to consider the effect of confounding factors. Meta-analysis effect estimates are reported as risk ratios (RR) and pooled association as adjusted odds ratios (aORs). Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals are presented. After removal of duplicates a total of 1791 articles were identified, of which 20 met the inclusion criteria. The results of the meta-analysis showed adolescents to have increased risk of all primary adverse outcomes investigated. Sub-group analysis suggests an increased risk of perinatal death and low birthweight for children born to adolescent mothers; 17 and under (perinatal death: RR 1.50, CI 1.32–1.71: low birthweight RR 1.43, CI 1.20–1.70); 18–19 (perinatal death RR 1.21, CI 1.06–1.37: low birthweight RR 1.10, CI 1.08–1.57). Mothers aged 17 and under were also at increased risk of preterm delivery (RR 1.64, CI 1.54–1.75). Analysis adjusted for confounders showed increased risk of preterm delivery (aOR 1.23, CI 1.09–1.38), very preterm delivery (aOR 1.22, CI 1.03–1.44) and neonatal death (aOR 1.31, CI 1.14–1.52). Findings show that young maternal age is a significant risk factor for adverse neonatal outcomes in developed countries. Adolescent maternal age therefore should be considered as a potential cause for concern in relation to neonatal health and it is recommended that health care professionals respond accordingly with increased support and monitoring. © 2020},

abstract={Objective: The objective of this study was to compare duration of active labor, delivery mode, maternal and neonatal morbidity and women's satisfaction with delivery after intravenous remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or standard epidural analgesia (EDA). Based on clinical observations, we hypothesized that women with PCA would have shorter labor. Study design: An observational study at a university hospital in Sweden 2009–16. Maternal and neonatal outcomes with PCA (n = 69) and EDA (n = 138) were compared. Results: Women with PCA had shorter active labor 5.6 ± 3.3 compared to 8.5 ± 4.4 h (p < 0.001) with EDA, and a higher rate of spontaneous delivery 94% (65/69) compared to 65% (n = 90/138) with EDA (p < 0.001). Intrapartum temperature >38 °C (p = 0.001) and signs of fetal asphyxia (p < 0.001) were less common with PCA. No maternal or neonatal sedation was observed. The rates of transient oxygen desaturation <95%, bleeding > 1000 mL and women's satisfaction with delivery did not differ between the groups. Conclusion: PCA had several advantages over EDA, as it was associated with shorter active labor and a higher rate of spontaneous delivery without worsening maternal or neonatal morbidity or women's satisfaction with delivery. Therefore, we suggest an increased availability of PCA for labor analgesia. We recommend continuous one-to-one care and oxygen saturation monitoring for all women during active labor. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To investigate the outcomes of the first ART cycle including all subsequent frozen-thaw cycles from the same oocyte retrieval till first live birth in women with cured endometrial tuberculosis. Study design: This is a 1:4 matched–pair study, 113 cured endometrial tuberculosis patients (TB group) and 452 patients of non-tuberculosis (Non-TB group) matched for age, basal E2, basal FSH and ovulation protocol who underwent first complete ART cycles in our institution during December 2010 and December 2015 were included in the study. The baseline characteristic, clinic data, and IVF treatment outcomes were compared and analyzed between the two groups. Results: Compared with the Non-TB group, the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates was similar (64.6% vs 65.1%, p = 0.89) but the cumulative live birth rates (40.7% vs 52.7%, p < 0.00) were significantly lower and the spontaneous abortion rates (37.0% vs 13.2%, P＜0.05 was significantly higher in TB group. There was no significant difference in the clinical pregnancy rates, live birth rates and spontaneous abortion rates between the fresh cycles and frozen-thaw cycles in the TB group. Conclusion: Women may have increased risk of miscarriage and decreased CLBRs after cured endometrial TB infection when undergoing IVF. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Around 1 % of pregnancies develop Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), causing high physical and psychological morbidity. Reports on HG recurrence rate in subsequent pregnancies vary widely. An accurate rate of recurrence is needed for informed reproductive decision making. Our objective is to systematically review and aggregate reported rates for HG subsequent to index pregnancies affected by HG. We searched databases from inception as per the protocol registered on PROSPERO. No language restrictions were applied. Inclusion was not restricted based on how HG was defined; reports of severe NVP were included where authors defined the condition as HG. We included descriptive epidemiological, case control and cohort study designs. Eligibility screening was performed in duplo. We extracted data on populations, study methods and outcomes of significance. A panel of patients reviewed the results and provided discussion and feedback. Quality was assessed with the JBI (2017) critical appraisal tool independently by two reviewers. We performed the searches on 1st November 2019. Our search yielded 4454 unique studies, of which five (n = 40,350 HG cases) matched eligibility criteria; One longitudinal and four population-based cohort studies from five countries. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 31 years. Definition of HG and data collection methods in all the studies created heterogeneity. Quality was low; studies lacked valid and reliable exposure, and/or follow-up was insufficient. Meta-analysis was not possible due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity. This systematic review found five heterogeneous studies reporting recurrence rates from 15 to 81%. Defining HG as hospital cases may have introduced detection bias and contribute to clinical heterogeneity. A prospective longitudinal cohort study using an internationally agreed definition of HG and outcomes meaningful to patients is required to establish the true recurrence rate of HG. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Background: The previous study on prognosis of preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pPROM) near the limit of viability showed various survival rate raging from 26 to 57 %%. This may be partly due to the fact that treatment of prematurely born babies vary from one country to another, or sometimes within a single country. In Japan, resuscitation efforts are made to newborns of early gestational age, normally from 22 weeks of gestation. Objective: To assess the natural history and short- and long-term prognosis in pregnancies complicated by preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM) near the limit of viability in a hospital in Japan. Method: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study. Cases with diagnosis of pPROM at a gestational age of 20–23 6/7 weeks and delivered in our hospital between April 2007 and December 2017 were examined. Result: 66 cases were included and of those, 54 (81.1 %) newborns survived to discharge. Of the neonates who survived to discharge, 42 (77.8 % of survivors) experienced severe morbidity at the time of discharge. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that later gestational age at pPROM and longer latency period were significantly associated with survival with no severe morbidities (per one day increase, adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.37, 95 % CI 1.03–1.83, p = 0.033 and per one day increase, adjusted OR 1.11, 95 % CI 1.02–1.21, p = 0.015). Of 23 cases followed at 36 months, 8 (34.8 %) showed developmental delay. Conclusion: The survival rate was significantly higher than the previous studies, yet many of the survivors experienced short-term severe morbidity. Of those who experienced short-term severe morbidity, however, more than half showed normal range development at 36 months. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Aims: MicroRNAs play essential roles in tumorigenesis and progression in various cancers including endometrial cancer. Here we assessed the role of miR-135a on proliferation, chemosensitivity, migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells. Methods: WST-1 assay was performed to examine the proliferation of HEC-1-B and ISHIKAWA endometrial cancer cells with altered expression of miR-135a, with or without cisplatin treatment. Transwell migration and matrigel invasion assays were used to assess the migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells. The Caspase-Glo3/7 assay was used to examine the effect of miR-135a on cisplatin-induced apoptosis of endometrial cancer cells. The dual-luciferase reporter assay was conducted to validate the putative binding site. Results: Upregulation of miR-135a improved the proliferation, and promoted migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells. Furthermore, miR-135a decreased the sensitivity of HEC-1-B and ISHIKAWA cells after cisplatin treatment. The cisplatin-induced apoptosis in endometrial cancer cells was inhibited by miR-135a by regulation of BAX and Bcl-2 expression. Meanwhile, miR-135a could regulate epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) by altering the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, snail and Vimentin in endometrial cancer cells. Further study showed that the expression levels of PTEN and p-AKT in endometrial cancer cells were changed after aberrant expression of miR-135a. Conclusion: MiR-135a played important roles in tumorigenesis and disease progression of endometrial cancer by regulating proliferation and chemosensitivy of endometrial cancer cells by targeting AKT signaling pathway. Our study indicates that miR-135a might act as a potential biomarker to predict chemotherapy response and prognosis in endometrial cancer. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: To evaluate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of trans-vaginal fractional micro-ablative CO2 laser therapy in combination with platelet rich plasma (PRP) for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. Study design: Participants with SUI underwent three sessions of transvaginal CO2 laser and PRP treatment, administered at 4-6-week intervals. Outcomes were assessed using the bladder function section of the Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire (APFQ). The primary outcome was changes in the participants’ symptoms of SUI. Secondary outcomes were related to general bladder function. Outcome differences from baseline (T1) to 3 months (T2) and 12 months (T3) were analysed using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Subjective verbal scales were used to assess the degree of pain associated with PRP injections and laser treatment. Results: Sixty-two women with SUI were enrolled into this study. There were 66% (41/62) of participants who reported improved SUI symptoms from T1 to T2 (p &lt; 0.001) and at T3, 62% (23/37) of patients reported improved SUI symptoms (p &lt; 0.001). From T1 to T2, all bladder function variables were improved significantly (p &lt; 0.002). At T3, significant improvements (p &lt; 0.03) were maintained for all bladder function variables, except pad usage (p = 0.073). Conclusions: Combining transvaginal fractional CO2 laser with PRP might be a beneficial treatment for SUI. It may have the potential to be a minimally-invasive and low-risk alternative to surgery, with reduced recovery time. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: This study aimed to synthesize evidence from published studies about the diagnostic accuracy of lamellar body count (LBC) as a predictor of fetal lung maturity. Study design: We searched Medline (via PubMed), EBSCO, Web of Science, Scopus and the Cochrane Library for relevant published studies assessing the accuracy of LBC as a predictor of fetal lung maturity. Studies were classified according to the counting essays, centrifugation protocols, and the reported optimum cut off values. Data of the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative were extracted and analyzed to calculate the overall sensitivity and specificity of the LBC. Results: Thirty-one studies were included in the final analysis. Fourteen studies reported data for centrifuged amniotic fluid (AF) samples, 13 studies reported data for uncentrifuged samples, and four studies did not have enough information about whether centrifugation was done. LBC showed an area under the curve >80% in diagnosing lung immaturity with variable cut off values. Pooled analysis showed that LBC a 100% specificity to exclude respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) at a cut off value of 15,000 and 100% sensitivity to diagnose RDS at a cut off value of 55,000. Conclusion: Cases with LBC < 15,000 are considered to have lung immaturity while cases with LBC > 45,000 in centrifuged AF samples or >55,000 in uncentrifuged AF samples are likely to have mature lungs. Cases with LBC ranging between these maturity and immaturity limits should be considered for further evaluation by other lung maturity tests. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: To validate the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire 2 (CEQ2) in the UK to see if it is an effective tool for evaluating labour experience. Study design: The CEQ2 and part of the Care Quality Commission Maternity Survey (2010) was sent to 475 women one month and six weeks after birth. It was tested for face validity among 25 postnatal mothers. Demographic data and delivery data was used to establish construct validity using the method of known-groups validation. The results of the scored CEQ2 sent out twice were used to measure test-retest reliability by calculating the quadratic weighted index of agreement between the two scores. Criterion validity was measured by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient for the CEQ2 and Maternity Survey scores. Results: Face validity of the CEQ2 in a UK population was demonstrated with all respondents stating it was easy to understand and complete. A statistically significantly higher CEQ2 score for subgroups of women known to report a better birth outcome demonstrated construct validity. A weighted kappa of 0.55 demonstrated test-retest reliability. A Pearson correlation co-efficient of 0.56 demonstrated a moderate correlation between the results of the CEQ2 and the results of the ‘gold standard’ assessment of childbirth experience in the UK: the Maternity Survey and hence criterion validity. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the Childbirth Experience Questionnaire version 2 (CEQ2) is a valid and reliable measure of childbirth experience in the UK population. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease. However, the etiology of endometriosis is still unclear, and current theories cannot fully elaborate its specific pathogenesis. Recently, some research has suggested that the occurrence and development of endometriosis may be related to genetics. Long-chain non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) is a kind of non-protein-coding RNA molecule with a length of 200-100,000 bp. With complex biological functions, lncRNAs play an important role in the normal development of individuals and the progression of various diseases, and lncRNAs have become an important field of medical research in recent years. This paper mainly illustrates the research progress on lncRNAs as they relate to endometriosis. We also provide some ideas for exploring the pathogenesis of endometriosis. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Aim: Evaluation of the executive function and working memory influence, as well as the general state of memory, on adherence to treatment with antimuscarinic drugs in elderly women with overactive bladder (OAB). Background: Antimuscarinic are effective and safe for the treatment of OAB, but adherence to treatment remains low. Demographic, socioeconomic, and medical factors which influence the medication adherence have been explored; however, the impact of executive function and working memory on adherence has not been evaluated yet. Methods: In total 417 women from 65 to 88 years old with the diagnosis overactive bladder were selected to participate in the study. They were prescribed AM drugs: trospium 15 mg / day (n = 138), or Solifenacin 5 mg / day (n = 132), or Darifenacin 7.5 mg / day (n = 147). The observation was carried out for 12 weeks. The urodynamic state was investigated using the questionnaire OABq-SF, uroflowmetry was performed at the start and end of the study, voiding diary - during the whole time of observation. The state of mental health was investigated using MMSE and GDS. The assessment of executive function and working memory, as well as general memory estimation, was carried out using the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Wechsler Memory Scale subscale, and the California Verbal Learning Test. Hierarchical and simultaneous regressions were calculated to study the effect of executive function and working memory on medication adherence. Results: The urodynamic state of patients significantly improved after the treatment, the cognitive functions did not change. The analysis of hierarchical and simultaneous regressions made it possible to establish that the predictor variables significantly influencing medication adherence of elderly women with OAB to AM treatment are executive function and working memory composite (β = .39, p < .05), severe symptoms of lower urinary tract (β =. -. 31, p < .05), and age (β =. -. 25, p < .05). Conclusion: The status of executive function and working memory, as well as the age and severity of the pathological symptoms of lower urinary tract should be considered when predicting adherence to AM treatment in elderly patients with OAB. © 2019 The Author},

abstract={Objective: The objective of this study was to review the records of patients with excised abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE) to determine patient characteristics, diagnostic methods, presence of concurrent pelvic endometriosis and type of surgery. Study design: Medical records from an 11-year period were searched to identify histologically confirmed AWE cases. Descriptive data were collected and analyzed. Two subgroups were differentiated: isolated AWE and pelvic endometriosis-associated AWE. Results: Thirty-five women with AWE were included. The most common symptom was cyclic abdominal or parietal pain (68.6%); 17.1% of the women had no symptoms. Twenty-nine women (82.8%) had a history of gynecological or obstetrical surgery, most commonly cesarean section (CS). The mean interval between prior surgery and appearance of symptoms was 5.3 years. Six women (17.1%) had no prior surgery; all six presented with umbilical nodules, nulliparity and confirmed mild to severe pelvic endometriosis. Among all patients, 34.3% had concurrent pelvic endometriosis, 40% presented with isolated AWE and 25.7% had no pelvic exploration. Women with concurrent pelvic endometriosis had significantly lower parity, smaller nodule size and a higher likelihood of umbilical location than those with isolated AWE (p < 0.05). A history of CS was more commonly found in women with isolated AWE. The overall recurrence rate over the study period was 11.4%, with a mean follow-up period of 5.2 years. Conclusions: AWE is an uncommon condition associated with long diagnostic and therapeutic delays. In patients with umbilical AWE and no surgical history, pelvic endometriosis is commonly present and should be highly suspected. © 2019 The Authors},

Therefore, we conducted a literature review to obtain specific knowledge of this disease. Thirteen cases of VESS were found by searching the Medline and EMBASE databases in the English language. The mechanism of VESS may be associated with endometriosis, and its diagnosis largely depends on pathological examination because it has no typical symptoms. Treatment of VESS incorporates surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy. Some novel drugs targeting its mechanism may become alternative therapies. Its prognostic factors may include tumor stage and the expression of hormonal receptors. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: To develop and validate a scoring system for laparoscopic skills for five specific tasks on a virtual reality simulator. Study design: A longitudinal, experimental, non-randomised study including 30 gynecologists and gynecological trainees at three hospitals. The participants were categorized as inexperienced (Group 1), moderately experienced (Group 2), and experienced (Group 3). The study participants performed ten repetitions of three basic skill tasks, a salpingectomy and a laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy on a virtual reality simulator. Assessment of skills was based on time, error parameters and economy of movements measured by the simulator. We used the results (mean and SD for each parameter in all tasks) of the four last repetitions performed by the experienced gynecologists as the basic for the scoring system. Performance equal to, and higher than, this mean score gave 2 points. A decrease of 1 SD from the mean gave 1 point. Every score below gave 0 points. The mean score for the inexperienced, moderately experienced and experienced study participants was compared. Results: The mean scores in Task 1 were 3.4 (SD 0.6) in Group 1, 3.4 (SD 0.6) in Group 2 and 5.1 (SD 1.1) in Group 3, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in score between Group 1 and 3 (p = 0.01), and group 2 and 3 (p = 0.01). In Task 2 no statistical significant differences were found. In Task 3, the total mean scores were 1.7 (SD 0.7) in Group 1, 1.9 (SD 0.9) in Group 2 and 2.8 (SD 0.5) in Group 3, respectively. The difference in score between study groups was statistically significant when comparing Group 1 and Group 3 (p < 0.01) and Group 2 and Group 3 (p = 0.02). In Task 4, the difference in used time between group 1 and 3 was statistically significant (p = 0.03). In task 5 there was a significant difference in performance score between group 1 and 3 (p = 0.01). Conclusions: There was significant difference in scores between the experienced and the inexperienced gynecologist in four out of five tasks. The scoring system is easy assessable and can be used for summative and formative feedback in proficiency-based assessment. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate a new a cut off level of fetal fibronectin as a predictor of birth in women with threatened preterm labour. Design: A retrospective cohort study performed at Ipswich hospital, Ipswich, Queensland, Australia, in women with threatened preterm labour with intact membranes between 23 weeks to 34 + 6 week gestation. Study design: A quantitative fetal fibronectin (fFN) was performed. Maternal demographics and birth outcome data were extracted from the routinely collected perinatal data held by the hospital. The odds of preterm birth were estimated for each cut off value of fFN (10, 50 and 200 ng ml−1) using logistic regression and accounting for multiple presentations by the same woman. Results: Among the 447 presentations and 376 pregnancies, rates of preterm birth &lt;34 weeks were 2.9%, 9.2%, 3.3%, 19.6%, 4.2% and 35.3% for each category of values respectively (fFN &lt;10, ≥10, &lt;50, ≥50, &lt;200 and ≥200 ng ml−1). Birth rates within 7 d of testing were 1.1%, 7.5%, 1.8%, 16.1%, 2.1% and 41.2% respectively. Comparing fFN level of &lt;10 to a level of 10-199 ng ml−1 there was no significant increase in odds of preterm birth &lt; 34 weeks or birth within the next 7 d (OR 2.28, 95% CI 0.84-6.17 and OR 3.61, 95% CI 0.89-14.7 respectively. Conclusion: In women presenting with TPL, those with levels of &lt;200 ng ml−1 have a low risk of birthing within 7 d or before 34 weeks gestation. This allows a personalised decision making and probable discharge home without need for steroid loading. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: To report long term pregnancy rate in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) treated by ovarian drilling. To evaluate predictive factors of pregnancy and possibility of a second drilling. Design: Retrospective, observational, multicenter study. Setting: Gynecologic departments of two teaching's hospitals. Patients: All infertile women with PCOS who were treated by ovarian drilling from 2004 to 2013. The Rotterdam criteria were applied to define PCOS. Intervention(s): Surgical ovarian drilling by laparoscopy and trans vaginal hydro laparoscopy. Main Outcome Measure(s): The primary endpoint was pregnancy rate after ovarian drilling. The secondary endpoints were the predictive factors of pregnancy and the possibility of a second ovarian drilling. Results: 289 women were included in the study. The mean follow-up period was 28.4 months (25.3–31.5). A pregnancy was obtained in at least 137 (47.4%) women after a drilling, and 71 (51.8%) of these pregnancies were spontaneous, 48 (16.6%) women achieved at least two pregnancies after drilling, and 27 (56.3%) of these were spontaneous. The predictive factors for effectiveness were a normal body mass index (BMI), an infertility period of less than three years, an AFC of less than 50, and an age of less than 35. Second drillings were performed on 33 women. Among them, 19 (57.6%) achieved at least one pregnancy, and 10 (52.6%) of these were spontaneous. It appeared that a second drilling was effective either when the first drilling had been successful (pregnancy achieved after drilling) or when it had failed in cases of high AFC (greater than 55). Conclusion: Ovarian drilling permitted to obtain spontaneous pregnancy for women with PCOS. This surgery could have durably effect permitted to obtain more than one pregnancy. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to use whole genome sequencing (WGS) help detect de novo mutations or pathogenic genes of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome type 1(MRKH syndrome type 1). Study design: This was a case-parent trios study. Nine unrelated probands, with MRKH syndrome type 1 and their parents were enrolled. The enrollment, sequencing process, establishment of the de novo mutations detecting procedure and experiment part were performed over a 2-year period. Results: we detected 632 de novo single nucleotide variants (SNVs), 267 de novo small insertions/deletions (indels), 39 de novo structural variations (SVs) and 28 de novo copy number alterations (CNAs). Three novel damaging coding de novo SNVs with three damaging coding de novo genes (PIK3CD, SLC4A10 and TNK2) were revealed. Two SNVs were annotated of the promoter region of gene NBPF10 and 3'UTR of NOTCH2NL, potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of MRKH. Conclusion: We identified five de novo mutations in BAZ2B, KLHL18, PIK3CD, SLC4A10 and TNK2 by performing WGS, the functional involvement of all deleterious mutations in MRKH candidate genes of the trios warrant further study. WGS may complement conventional array to capture the complete landscape of the genome in MRKH. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objective: To compare the incidence of wound infection after cesarean delivery in procedures conducted using adhesive incisional drapes verses no adhesive incisional drapes. Study Design: Searches were performed in electronic databases (MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, OVID, EMBASE, and the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews). We included randomized controlled trials comparing adhesive incisional drapes to no adhesive incisional drapes during cesarean delivery. The primary outcome of this meta-analysis was wound infection. Meta-analysis was performed using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird, to produce relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: 52 publications were identified through initial search of databases and two randomized controlled trials were eligible and included in the meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis examined a total of 1943 subjects and showed a statistically significant increase in wound infections in patients in the adhesive incisional drape group when compared to the control group (RR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.02–1.65). Conclusion: Adhesive incisional drapes may increase the incidence of wound infections after cesarean delivery. Further studies are necessary to explore this relationship in the setting of current postoperative infection prophylaxis, including broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, skin preparation and vaginal cleansing. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: The aims of this study were to assess the role of omentectomy in the staging of uterine serous carcinoma (USC) and to evaluate its impact on patient outcomes. Study design: Patients diagnosed with USC at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University of China were retrospectively reviewed. The clinicopathological characteristics and survival data of 187 patients were analyzed. Risk factors for omental metastasis were evaluated. Kaplan–Meier survival curves were used to compare survival status and the presence of omental metastasis. Results: We found that 35 of 187 patients (18.7%) had omental metastases. Omental metastasis was significantly associated with adnexal involvement (40.0% vs 19.1%, P = 0.008, OR 2.828, 95% CI 1.286–6.218). Multivariate analysis showed that in addition to lymph node metastases and suboptimal surgery, omental metastasis in USC remained an independent predictor of decreased PFS and OS (PFS, HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14–4.63, P = 0.024; OS, HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.04–3.60, P = 0.043). Conclusions: The incidence of omental metastasis is not low in patients with USC. Visual assessment and omental biopsy may be insufficient for recognizing occult metastases. Omentectomy should be part of the staging surgery in USC patients because it provides additional information about survival. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results. © 2019},

abstract={The prevalence of post-caesarean scar uterus, the most important risk factor of uterine rupture is increasing globally. Grand multiparity can also increase the risk of uterine rupture. The issue of grand multiparous with single post caesarean scar is poorly investigated. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess the factors associated with the mode of delivery of grand multiparous with post caesarean single uterine scar in low resources settings. Patients and Method: It was a retrospective cohort study conducted from the 1st January to the 31st of May 2016, in three university teaching hospitals of the university of Yaoundé I in Cameroon. Grand multiparous (GMP) defined as parity ≥5 with single post-caesarean lower segment uterine scar admitted at a gestational age of 37 completed weeks and above were compared to grand multiparous without scar uterus at term. GMP with unknown scar were excluded. The mode of delivery and materno-fetal and neonatal outcome were investigated. Results: We included 33 GMP with single lower segment uterine scar and 120 GMP without uterine scar. Induction of labor and acute fetal distress were not related to having a scar or not in grand GMP, but augmentation of labor was less likely to be conducted in case of GMP with scar uterus(p = 0.08). The frequency of vaginal delivery was 75.8 and 87.5% in grand multiparous with and without uterine scar respectively (OR 0.17–1.16; P = 0.085), with one case of instrumental delivery in scarless group. However, single scar multiparity status increased by 2.42 folds the risk of delivery by caesarian section (P = 0.066). Cephalo-pelvic disproportion increased the indication of caesarian section by 12-fold in the GMP with scar group (p = 0.031), but mechanical dystocia related indications (CPD, macrosomia,) were present in only 4 cases out of 8 caesarian sections in the exposed group. The Apgar score at the fifth minute was better in the GMP with scar group. (p = 0.037). Conclusion: Grand multiparous with single post-cesarean uterine scar should be given a chance of vaginal delivery in the absence added feto-maternal morbidity. © 2019 The Author},

abstract={Objective: The aim of the present study was to compare post-operative complications and recurrence of three surgical techniques: segmental resection, discoid excision and nodule shaving. Study design: From January 2014 to December 2017, 143 patients who underwent segmental bowel resections for endometriosis at “La Paz” University Hospital, were enrolled and grouped by different techniques. We compared post-operative complications and recurrence rate in three groups: 76 (53%) patients underwent segmental resection (group I), 20 (14%) patients underwent discoid resection (group II) and 47 (33%) patients underwent rectal shaving (group III). Qualitative data was defined by absolute values and percentages, and quantitative data by mean and standard deviation. Qualitative variables between groups were compared using Chi- squared test. While quantitative data between groups was performed by means of t-test and ANOVA test. For all statistical tests a value of p < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Result: Segmental resection was associated with higher rate of severe post-operative complications in comparison with discoid resection or shaving technique (23.5% versus 5% versus 0% respectively) (p = 0.005). We showed statistical differences among the three study groups for nodule size (p < 0.001) and localization (p = 0.02). Our analysis showed statistical differences among the three groups in term of additional procedures performed at the same time of bowel surgery, in particular in case of endometriosis of the ureter (p = 0.001) and the parametrium (p = 0.04). After a long follow-up (46.4 ± 0.5 months for the group I, 42.2 ± 1.6 months for the group II, 39.7 ± 1.8 months for the group III), the shaving group was associated to higher recurrence rate (12.7%) in comparison with the discoid group (5%) and the segmental resection group (1.3%) (p = 0.01). Conclusion: We showed that segmental resection is associated with high rate of postoperative complications. Conversely, this strategy should avoid the need of further interventions in young patients. Conservative surgery, such as discoid resection and shaving, revealed a higher recurrence rate and could be more appropriate in women approximating menopause because of the lower possibility of recurrence. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: To explore the role of VEGF in attenuating endoplasmic reticulum stress in placental trophoblast cells. Study design: Study was divided into following parts: 1. Serum Analysis of GRP78 and VEGF using sandwich ELISA. 2. Expression of VEGF and GRP78 in placentae by immunohistochemistry (IHC). 3. In Vitro experiments. Status of ER stress markers (GRP78, eIF2α, XBP1, ATF6 and CHOP) was assessed at various time points (8 h, 14 h, 24 h) when trophoblast cells were treated with varying concentration(s) of VEGF and also by adding recombinant VEGF at protein (Immunofluorescence, Western blot) and transcript levels (qRT-PCR). Results: Increased GRP78 and decreased VEGF protein levels in sera and placentae of preeclamptic pregnant women and reduced expression of various ER stress markers at both transcript and protein levels was observed in trophoblast cells when they were exposed to recombinant VEGF thereby indicating positive role of VEGF in alleviating ER stress. Conclusions: Reduced expression of ER stress markers in trophoblast cells against increased VEGF highlighted a new window to explore prospective drugs that can be designed to modulate the activities of various ER stress sensors in order to alleviate ER stress in pregnant women with preeclampsia. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in women treated for infertility and oocyte donors, and to investigate the possible influence of HPV infection on reproductive outcomes. Study design: In this observational laboratory-based study, cervical swabs were collected from oocyte donors (n = 207), and women treated for infertility (n = 945) and analysed for the presence of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) genotypes using the cobas® 4800 HPV Test and PapilloCheck® HPV-Screening. Associations between hrHPV positive status and fertility outcome or socio-behavioral and health characteristics were evaluated using R statistical software. Results: HrHPV prevalence was significantly higher in oocyte donors than in women treated for infertility (28.0% vs. 16.1%, P &lt; 0.001). Women who became pregnant spontaneously (19.6%) and women not treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF, 18.1%) were more frequently hrHPV positive than women treated with IVF (12.7%, P = 0.077). Despite the high prevalence of hrHPV in both oocyte donors and infertile women, no associations between hrHPV positive status and pregnancy or abortion rates were found in IVF treated women or in oocyte recipients. Moreover, no associations between hrHPV positive status and abortion rates were found in spontaneously pregnant women. Conclusion: Despite the high prevalence of hrHPV in both oocyte donors and infertile women, HPV infection did not influence the outcomes of assisted reproductive technology. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: Which analgesia methods are used during oocyte retrieval in the Netherlands? StudyDesign: In April 2017, an online survey containing questions on the analgesia protocol used for IVF/ICSI oocyte retrieval was sent to all clinics in the Netherlands that perform oocyte retrievals. Results: The response rate was 97%. We uncovered the large variety of medication protocols used for pain relief during oocyte retrieval in the Netherlands. Based on the main component of the given analgesia, we distinguished the three most frequently used analgesia protocols: intravenously (i.v.) administered opioids, intramuscularly (i.m) administered opioids, and non-sedative oral analgesics. Aside from analgesia, 61% provided anxiolysis with a benzodiazepine. Nearly half of the clinics registered pain scores. The vital functions were monitored at all clinics administering opioids i.v., but at none of the clinics administering opioids i.m. Conclusions: A wide variety of analgesia protocols are used. The three most frequently used are i.v. administered opioids, i.m. administered opioids, and non-sedative oral analgesics. The variety of analgesia protocols is not desirable in the context of good clinical practice, and considering the risks of combining opioids and benzodiazepines. Monitoring of vital functions was only performed after administration of i.v. medication. A comparison of the pain scores could be a first step in finding the optimal method of analgesia, thereby forming the basis of guidelines for analgesia during oocyte retrieval. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate outcomes of fluorinated corticosteroids, with or without other medications, for treatment of congenital heart block in-utero. Study design: A search was conducted through MEDLINE, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE and SCOPUS from inception to October 2017. Only comparative studies are considered eligible. Outcomes include fetal death, downgrade of heart block, neonatal death, need for neonatal pacing, fetal and maternal complications. Random effects model was used. Results: Out of 923 articles, 12 studies were eligible. Compared to no treatment, there was no significant difference in incidence of fetal death (OR 1.10, 95%CI 0.65–1.84), neonatal death (OR 0.98, 95%CI 0.41–2.33), or need for pacing (OR 1.46, 95%CI 0.78–2.74). Heart block downgrade was significantly higher in treatment group (9.48%vs.1.76%, OR 3.27, 95%CI 1.23–8.71). Conclusion: antenatal fluorinated corticosteroids do not improve fetal/neonatal morbidity or mortality of congenital heart block and are associated with higher incidence of fetal and maternal complications. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: We have recently introduced intrapartum PCR-testing for group B streptococcus (GBS) in women in labor with prolonged rupture of membranes or preterm delivery to offer intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis only for GBS positive women. The goal of the present study is to report our experience and results from the first half year of GBS testing. Study design: This is a retrospective study. Rectovaginal swabs from 321 women presenting in the labor ward with pre-labor rupture of membranes for >14 h/rupture of membranes during delivery for >14 h, or labor between gestational weeks 35 0/7 and 36 6/7 from February 7, 2017 to August 6, 2017, were tested. We performed a molecular GBS test (Xpert GBS®, Cepheid Ltd., Sunnyvale, USA). Data from patient files including mode of delivery, use of antibiotics, infection of mother and child are presented in more detail. Data on the PCR results from the first year of testing were also collected. Results: In the first half-year of testing a positive GBS test result was found in 58 (18.1%) and a negative test result in 263 women (81.9%). No invalid test result was achieved. The indication for performing PCR testing was PROM > 14 h or rupture of membranes during labor for >14 h in 266 women (82.9%) and labor in gestational weeks 35 0/7–36 6/7 in 44 women (13.7%). In the remaining 11 women, the PCR test was performed for other reasons. Of the 321 women tested 126 (39%) received antibiotics during labor. Ten women (3.4%) were treated after delivery on suspicion of infection. 25 newborns (7.8%) were treated with antibiotics. In 11 cases, the treatment was stopped after 2–4 days as there were no signs of infection. Conclusions: The introduction of the intrapartum GBS test in selected groups of women who gave birth in our department has been well accepted by the women, the midwifes and doctors. The result of the test is available within two hours, and as we only offer intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to GBS-positive women, we have reduced the use of antibiotics to approximately 40% in the groups tested, without an increase of infection in mother or child. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: Ovarian hyper-stimulation during IVF is associated with a significant raise in serum estrogens and one may expect detrimental effects on estrogen-dependent diseases such as endometriosis. However, available evidence from large case series of affected women performing IVF is generally reassuring with the possible exception of women carrying deep invasive lesions. On this basis we deemed important investigating more in depth whether women with deep invasive endometriosis could be a subgroup at higher risk of recurrence or disease progression during IVF. Study design: Women with endometriosis who underwent IVF and who had a second evaluation after 3–6 months from a failed cycle were retrospectively reviewed. The main inclusion criteria were the presence of deep invasive endometriosis and/or a history of surgery for this form of the disease. The primary aim of the study was to determine the frequency of endometriosis-related complications in the interval between the two evaluations. Secondary aims were pain symptoms and lesion size modifications. Results: Eighty-four women were ultimately selected: baseline ultrasound documented deep invasive lesions in 60 of them. One case of possible endometriosis-related complication was recorded, corresponding to a rate of 1.2% (95%: 0.05%–5.5%) for the whole cohort and 1.7% (95%CI: 0.08–7.6%) for the subgroup of women with ultrasound detected lesions. This rate appears similar to the reported frequency of endometriosis progression in women not receiving IVF. No significant modifications in pain symptoms or lesions size occurred. Conclusions: Women with deep invasive endometriosis who underwent IVF do not seem to be exposed to a substantially increased risk of recurrence/disease progression. Larger evidence from independent groups is however required for a definitive conclusion. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: The human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause premalignant and malignant tumors in the anogenital and oropharyngeal regions. The aim of this study was to describe the association in the prevalence of cervical, anal, and oral HPV infections in high-risk patients with biopsy-confirmed high-grade cervical lesion compared to low-risk women. Study Design: A total of 718 immunocompetent women were enrolled in the study. The high-risk (HR) group consisted of 473 patients with biopsy-confirmed high-grade cervical lesion while the low-risk (LR) group consisted of other 245 women. All participants completed an anonymous self-administered questionnaire and were subjected to cervical, anal, and oral HPV genotyping using the Linear array HPV test. Results: A total of 81.4% women were infected in the cervix, 43.3% in the anus, and 2.7% in the oral cavity in the HR group in comparison with only 26.9%, 24.5%, and 1.4% in the low-risk LR group, respectively. The cervical and anal HPV infections were much more frequent in the HR patients (p &lt; 0.001); the difference in the oral HPV prevalence was not significant (p = 0.511) between groups. Concurrent cervical-anal infection was observed in 39.3% of HR women and in 8.3% of the LR patients (p &lt; 0.001) and it significantly increased with the grade of cervical lesion (ptrend&lt;0.001). The higher prevalence of concurrent cervical-oral, anal-oral, and cervical-anal-oral infections in HR women was statistically not significant according to the generally small oral HPV prevalence. Conclusions: All HPV infections occurred more often in HR than in LR women but not all results were statistically significant.

abstract={Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the oncologic outcome of women with stage I ovarian endometrioid carcinoma (EC) who underwent fertility-sparing surgery (FSS). Materials and nethods: Between 1986 and 2017, a total of 3227 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma were retrospectively evaluated based on a central pathological review and search of the medical records from multiple institutions. We identified 24 and 54 patients with stage I EC who underwent FSS and conventional radical surgery (CRS), respectively. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)–adjusted Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were employed to compare OS between the two groups. Results: With follow-up of a total of 78 patients, 9 patients (11.5%) developed recurrence. In addition, 5 patients (6.4%) died of the disease. Recurrence was noted in 3 (10.7%) patients in the FSS group and 6 (11.1%) patients in the CRS group. Death was noted in 2 (8.3%) patients in the FSS group and 3 (5.6%) patients in the CRS group. In the original cohort, there was no significant difference in overall survival (OS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) between the FSS and RS groups {Log-rank: OS (P = 0.630), RFS (P = 0.757)}. In the IPTW-adjusted cohort, the 5-year OS rates were 96.6 and 92.4% in patients with FSS and CRS, respectively (P = 0.319). Furthermore, the 5-year RFS rate was 88.6% for the FSS group and 88.1% for the CRS group (Log-rank: P = 0.556). Conclusions: Young women with stage I EC undergoing FSS showed a relatively satisfactory prognosis, equal to those receiving CRC. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Introduction: To reassess the prevalence of fallopian tube endometriosis (EM), and its associated clinicopathologic characteristics and risk factors. Methods: Cross-sectional study was conducted from June 2016 to August 2017. Unpregnant premenopausal women who underwent unilateral or bilateral salpingectomy due to gynecologic diseases were recruited. Patient clinical data and fallopian tube specimens were collected. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining and CD10 immunohistochemistry were used to diagnose tubal EM. Results: Tubal EM prevalence was 14.48% (161/1112, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.41%–16.55%). Prevalence of tubal EM in patients with EM was 37.37% (95%CI 30.58%–44.17%) which is higher in patients without EM (9.52%, 95%CI 7.61%–11.42%) and even higher in those with multi-organ EM (43.94%, 95%CI 35.36%–52.52%). At unilateral or bilateral salpingectomy, tubal EM was more likely located in the left fallopian tube (52.17%) than the right one (40.37%) and presence of hydrosalpinx/ hematosalpinx increased in women with tubal EM than without tubal EM (43.47% versus 23.79%). With increasing severity of pelvic EM (r = 0.26, P&lt;10−4) and adhesion (r = 0.25, P&lt;10−4), the tubal EM prevalence also increased. Pathological examination found that tubal EM was more likely located in the mucosa of the proximal tube with significantly more surrounding inflammation and fibrotic lesions than the serosa/sub-serosa in the distal tube (r = 0.90, P&lt;10−4). Multivariate analysis showed that abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) (AOR = 3.10), previous EM surgery (AOR = 4.22) and tubal ligation (AOR = 2.33) were risk factors for tubal EM. Conclusions: These data provide clinicians with important information that the prevalence of tubal EM among premenopausal unpregnant patients was higher than previous investigators, especially higher among women with EM diseases. Identifying its clinicopathologic characteristics and predictors may facilitate clinical decision making. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: The QUiPP application is used to predict the risk of recurrent preterm birth (PTB) in asymptomatic high risk women with a previous PTB. Our study aims to evaluate the impact of the use of the QUiPP app on maternal anxiety levels. Study design: A retrospective cohort study on asymptomatic pregnant women attending the Prevention of Preterm Birth Clinic in a busy tertiary unit. Women included in the study had a history of previous PTB. The study assessment occurred at approximately 4 weeks prior to the gestation of the earliest previous PTB and included measurement of cervical length and vaginal fetal fibronectin. Data was inputted into the QUiPP application, which in turn estimated risk of preterm delivery at specific intervals. Measured outcomes were gestation at delivery, time from risk assessment to delivery, infant birth weight, NICU admission and length of stay. In addition, maternal anxiety levels were retrospectively assessed using a questionnaire with a Likert scale. Results: Seventy six women were included in the study. All women were asymptomatic for preterm labour at assessment. The mean gestation at the time of risk assessment was 27 weeks, the mean time from risk assessment to delivery was 72 days. Average gestation at time of delivery was 37 weeks (range 22–42 weeks). The preterm birth rate was 29% (n = 22).Seventy seven percent of women who delivered <37 weeks, and 80% who delivered <34 weeks were given QUiPP scores predicting a ≥5% chance of PTB within four weeks of their actual delivery date. Sixteen percent of infants were admitted to NICU (n = 12) with a mean length of stay of 21 days. All infants went home well with their parents. Eighty four percent of respondents to our questionnaire reported feeling anxious about their pregnancy prior to attending the clinic. After receiving a QUIPP score 90% said they felt reassured and 79% reported that the felt less anxious. Conclusion: In asymptomatic women, the use of the QUiPP app helps to predict, prevent, and optimise PTB. This surveillance has a beneficial role for maternal mental well-being in that it reduces anxiety at a key time during a pregnancy. © 2019},

abstract={Objectives: To investigate whether live birth (LB) is associated with oocyte yield and number of biopsied and suitable blastocyst to transfer following preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) and chromosomal structural rearrangements (PGT-SR). Study design: All couples underwent controlled ovarian stimulation, blastocyst biopsy, vitrification and transfer of suitable embryo(s) in a frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle. Results: Of 175 couples who underwent PGT treatment, 249 oocytes retrievals were carried out and 230 FET were subsequently undertaken. 122/230 (53%, 95% CI 47–59) FET resulted in a LB and 16/230 (7%, 95% CI 4–11) have resulted in ongoing pregnancies. 21/230 (9%, 95% CI 6–14) FET resulted in miscarriage and 69/230 (30%, 95% CI 24–36) concluded with failed implantation. Two (1%, 95% CI 0–3) transfers underwent termination for congenital malformation, with no evidence of misdiagnosis by prenatal testing. The relationship between number of oocytes retrieved and number of blastocysts biopsied and suitable embryos to transfer were significant (p = 0.00; Incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.05; 95% 1.04–1.06; p = 0.00; IRR 1.04; 95%, 1.03–1.06), respectively. The number of oocytes collected (p = 0.007; OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.01–1.10), the number of blastocysts biopsied (p = 0.001; OR 1.14; 95% 95% CI 1.06–1.23) and the number of suitable embryos to transfer (p = 0.00; OR 1.38; 95% CI 1.17–1.64) were all significantly associated with the odds of achieving a LB. There is a 14% and 38% increased chance of a LB per additional blastocyst biopsied and suitable embryo to transfer, respectively. Conclusions: PGT-M and PGT-SR outcomes are significantly associated with egg yield, number of blastocysts to biopsy and suitable embryos to transfer. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: Intra-uterine insemination (IUI) is widely used for different indications. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficiency of intra-uterine insemination as a function of indication and origin of the inseminated spermatozoa. Study design: The retrospective study involved 827 first attempts of IUI in 827 couples between January 2011 and July 2017 in the Toulouse university hospital. Of these, 642 used fresh sperm from the husband, 40 frozen sperm from the husband and 145 frozen sperm from donors. The measured outcome parameter was live birth rate per attempt. Results: When comparing couples lacking functional gametes (due to male or female causes), to couples who could potentially conceive spontaneously, i.e. subfertile, the latter were found to have a significantly lower live birth rate (18% vs 26%; P < 0.05). Even when adjusted for demographic parameters, which differed significantly between the 2 groups (female age, percentage of women suffering from primary infertility, BMI, number of inseminated motile spermatozoa and stimulation duration), this difference remained statistically significant (OR = 0.639 [0.425-0.961]; P = 0.0316). Conclusion: When compared to couples lacking functional gametes, subfertile couples have poor IUI outcomes, suggesting a hidden cause of infertility, despite no apparent differences in ovarian reserve, tubal potency, results of ovarian stimulation and normal conventional sperm parameters. Further studies are required to better characterise and identify this subgroup of women with poor IUI outcomes. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Recently, increasing attention and controversy have focused on whether weight loss can improve female sexual function, so we performed this study to explore this question. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases to identify all studied variables; the search terms included “weight loss”, “bariatric surgery”, “no surgery weight loss”, and “female sexual function”. We compared the female sexual function index (FSFI) scores before and after weight loss through bariatric surgery or exercise. Results: Ten studies comprising a total of 494 patients met the inclusion criteria. The data synthesized from these studies indicated that weight loss improved the total FSFI score (p < 0.00001) and the score on some individual items—desire (p < 0.00001); arousal (p = 0.0005); lubrication (p = 0.01); orgasm (p < 0.0001); and satisfaction (p = 0.0004)—but did not ameliorate pain experienced by women during sex (p = 0.18). Conclusion: Weight loss through bariatric surgery or exercise is beneficial for sexual function in overweight women, according to the data analyzed from ten studies. © 2019},

abstract={Objectives: Oocyte and/or embryo vitrification after controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) represents the most established method of fertility preservation (FP) before cancer treatment. However, traditional COS regimens are associated with supraphysiologic serum estradiol and are therefore not recommended in estrogen-sensitive diseases such as breast cancer (BC). To protect the patients from the potential deleterious effects of elevated estrogen levels during COS for FP, protocols using aromatase inhibitors (letrozole) were developed. The present study aims at investigating whether COS with letrozole supplementation (COSTLES) modifies ovarian response in BC patients. Study design: One hundred and seventy-seven BC patients candidates for FP using oocyte and/or embryo vitrification following COS referred to our center between July 2013 and December 2016 were included in this retrospective case-control study. 94 patients underwent COSTLES while 83 had standard GnRH antagonist protocol. The number of oocytes retrieved, oocyte maturation rates, number of oocytes vitrified and follicle responsiveness to FSH assessed by the Follicular Output Rate (FORT) were assessed. Results: Women in both groups were comparable in terms of age and ovarian reserve tests leading to a similar number of oocyte recovered (13.1 ± 10.0 vs. 12.2 ± 8.0 oocytes, respectively, NS). However, oocyte maturation rates were significantly lower in COSTLES compared to standard protocol (64.9 ± 22.8 vs. 77.4 ± 19.3%, p < 0.001). As a result, the number of mature oocyte vitrified was lower in COSTLES group (7.8 ± 5.3 vs. 10.3 ± 8.5 oocytes, p < 0.001 respectively) Conclusion: Despite similar response to exogenous FSH, BC patients having undergone COSTLES show reduced oocyte maturation rates in comparison with those having received standard stimulation regimen. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: Balloon catheter is the preferred method for induction of labor in women with prior cesarean section. We sought to evaluate the rate of vaginal delivery, induction-delivery time and outcome predictors after induction with double-balloon catheter. Study design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study including women with prior cesarean section undergoing induction of labor with a double-balloon catheter during the period January 2007–June 2014 at a large, tertiary Danish university hospital. For comparison, we included women with no prior cesarean section undergoing induction with double-balloon catheter after failed medical induction. Inclusion criteria were singleton pregnancy, an unfavorable cervix, intact membranes, cephalic presentation and either previous cesarean section or failed medical induction of labor. Exclusion criteria included contraindications for vaginal delivery, severe fetal malformation and stillbirth. Study subjects were identified in a local computerized system and data extracted from the medical records. Results: Women with prior cesarean section (n = 304) induced with double-balloon catheter had a vaginal delivery rate of 50.3% (95% CI 44.7–55.9) compared to 51.7% (95% CI 39.2–64.1) in women with no prior cesarean section but preceding failed medical induction of labor (n = 58) (p = 0.85). BMI≥30 was associated with increased frequency of cesarean section. Median time from induction to vaginal delivery was 27.1(20.4–31.1) hours and 28.4(25.5–36.1) hours, respectively (p = 0.05). The rate of complete uterine rupture was 1.0%. Conclusions: Similar success rates of approximately 50% for vaginal delivery were observed after induction of labor with a double-balloon catheter in women with and without prior caesarean section. A BMI ≥ 30 was associated with an increased frequency of caesarean section. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide and is associated with precancerous lesions and cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, tonsils and base of the tongue. Several studies show an increased risk of HPV-associated cancers in solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR). The aims of this review are to investigate the evidence of efficacy for the HPV vaccination in transplant recipients and to discuss the known national guidelines. A systematic literature search has been conducted to identify studies where SOTR received the HPV vaccination to evaluate the efficacy of the HPV vaccine on this population. The primary outcome was antibody response against the HPV genotypes included in the vaccines and the secondary outcome was national guidelines recommending HPV vaccination of SOTR. Three cohort studies evaluated immunogenicity. Two studies found suboptimal effect of the HPV vaccine, while an early terminated study detected 100% seropositivity. We have identified four national guidelines in the following countries; United States of America, Canada, Australia and Ireland, along with a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO). The results from the three studies were inconclusive due to the small sample sizes and the diverging results. Recommendations of HPV vaccination of SOTR is based on the knowledge about safety and efficiency in the general population and the safety of other inactivated (not live) vaccines in SOTR. Theoretically, the nonavalent vaccine should be recommended as the first choice in SOTR without age- or sex restrictions. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objectives Stillbirth is an important and yet relatively unacknowledged public health concern in many parts of the world. Public awareness of stillbirth and its potentially modifiable risk factors is a prerequisite to planning prevention measures. Cultural and regional differences may play an important role in awareness and attitudes to stillbirth prevention. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the awareness of stillbirth among hospital staff in Qatar and the UK, representing two culturally different regions. Study design An online population survey for anonymous completion was sent to the hospital email accounts of all grades of staff (clinical and non-clinical) at two hospitals in Qatar and one tertiary hospital Trust in the UK. The survey was used to gather information on the participants’ demographic background, the experience of stillbirth, knowledge of stillbirth, awareness of information and support sources, as well as attitude towards investigation and litigation. Data were analysed using descriptive and comparative statistics (Chi-Square test and Fisher's exact test). Results 1002 respondents completed the survey, including 349 in the Qatar group and 653 in the UK group. There were significant differences in group demographics in terms of language, religion, gender, nationality and experience of stillbirth. The groups also differed significantly in the knowledge of stillbirth, its incidence and risk factors. The two groups took different views on apportioning blame on healthcare services in cases of stillbirth. The Qatar group showed significantly less awareness of available support organisations and relied significantly more on online sources of information for stillbirths (p < 0.001). Conclusions This comparative study demonstrated significant differences between the two culturally distinct regions in the awareness, knowledge and attitudes towards stillbirths. The complex cultural and other factors that may be contributory should be further studied. The results highlight the need for increasing public awareness around stillbirth as part of effective prevention strategies. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous condition which is related to an endocrine reproductive disorder of females. It affects females of 18–44 age. The persistent hormonal disbalance leads to the complexities such as numerous cysts, an irregular menstrual cycle that ultimately leads to infertility among females. Many candidate genes have been identified to be one of the causes of PCOS. Different studies have been carried out to find the genetic correlation of PCOS. It is essential to carry out such studies that identify the clear cause of PCOS and its genetic association and hormonal disbalance. This review has highlighted different genes and their correlation with PCOS that leads to hormonal disbalance.

abstract={Objectives: To study endometriosis-associated borderline or malignant ovarian epithelial tumors by analyzing their differential clinical features, as well as the histological pattern, survival and immunohistochemical data compared with those without associated endometriosis. Study design: Setting: Hospital Marina Baixa and San Juan University Hospital, Alicante, Spain. This retrospective study included clinical and pathological data from 36 operated cases with endometriosis-associated ovarian epithelial tumors and 305 cases of ovarian epithelial tumors without endometriosis, including borderline and invasive tumors. We also studied hormonal receptors and p53 protein expression in 13 cases with endometriosis-associated endometrioid and clear cell tumors, and report two cases with histologically-confirmed previous endometriosis. Results: Associated endometriosis was observed in 10.5% of patients with borderline or invasive ovarian epithelial tumor, 53% of those with endometrioid, and 22% with clear cell tumors. Patients with endometriosis-associated ovarian epithelial tumors were younger, had lower parity, were more frequently premenopausal, had a lower tumor stage or were borderline, and in general had better prognosis and longer survival, although they also more frequently had an associated endometrial carcinoma. Associated endometriosis and endometrioid tumors were generally estrogen-receptor positive, whereas they were negative in the clear cell tumor component. p53 protein positivity was generally observed in clear cell tumors and in associated endometriosis. Two reported cases with previous, known endometriosis were followed in their evolution to borderline endometrioid carcinoma and clear cell carcinoma, respectively. Conclusions: Our results and review of the literature suggest that the association of ovarian epithelial tumors and endometriosis is a factor for good prognosis for ovarian cancer and that this association might correspond in many cases to an intermediate stage in the development of endometriosis to endometrioid, clear cell, or other invasive carcinomas. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: This study aimed to investigate whether oocyte retrieval from PCOS patients affects the morphokinetics or the incidence of abnormalities in early embryonic development, using time-lapse imaging analysis. Methods: This was a prospective study in total of 39 PCOS patients and 67 women with normal ovarian function, underwent a GnRH antagonist protocol of controlled ovarian stimulation and fertilization by ICSI. 402 zygotes from the PCOS group and 449 zygotes from the control group were observed by time-lapse monitoring for 48 h following sperm injection. Results: Patients with PCOS showed a significantly higher number of retrieved oocytes, and a significantly higher number of metaphase II oocytes per cycle than that of the non-PCOS group (18.85 ± 9.41 vs. 11.48 ± 5.51 and 14.97 ± 7.43 vs. 9.51 ± 4.7, respectively). However, oocyte maturation rate and morphologically assessed embryo quality did not differ between two groups. After 48 h of the embryo culture using time-lapse video recording, most of the embryos in both groups had reached the 4-cell stage (353/449 vs. 314/402 embryos). There were no significant differences between the control and PCOS group regarding the time-points of the successive events in early embryonic development from the appearance of 2 polar bodies to the 6-cell stage. However, the percentage of t2 stages which fell in “optimal range” (>24 h and ≤28 h) was significantly lower in the PCOS group than in the control group (37.8% vs. 48.1%, P = 0.004). The proportion of embryos manifesting abnormal fertility, multinucleation, direct cleavage and reverse cleavage were not significantly different between the two groups. Conclusion: Our data indicated that PCOS does not affect the morphokinetics or incidence of abnormalities in early embryonic development. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Introduction: According to the International Urogynecological Association and International Continence Society people with normal pelvic floor muscle function should have the ability to voluntarily and involuntarily contract and relax these muscles. However, many women are unaware of their pelvic floor, and it is estimated that about 30–50% do not know how to actively contract these muscles. Within this context, therapeutic strategies to improve pelvic floor muscle strength and function are particularly relevant. Aims: To compare the use of an intravaginal vibratory stimulus (IVVS) versus intravaginal electrical stimulation (IVES) on pelvic floor muscle functionality in women with pelvic floor dysfunctions who cannot voluntarily contract these muscles. Materials and methods: Randomized clinical trial performed at a tertiary care hospital from June 2016 to September 2017. The sample comprised adult women with pelvic floor dysfunction who were unable to contract their pelvic floor muscles voluntarily. Women with latex allergy or other allergies in the pelvic region, vaginal or urinary tract infection, gynecological cancer, significant pain on palpation, or pelvic floor training over the preceding 6 months were excluded. After baseline assessment, women that met the inclusion criteria were randomized to receive once-weekly 20-minute sessions of IVVS or IVES for 6 weeks. Results: Twenty-one women were randomly assigned to each group; 18 completed the IVVS and 17 completed the IVES protocols. The IVVS group presented a significant increase in PFM strength in relation to the IVES group (p = 0.026). There was a significant interaction between time and type of intervention for the same variable (p = 0.008) in the IVVS group. Conclusion: Both techniques were beneficial, but IVVS was significantly superior to IVES in improving pevic floor muscle strength. Additional studies are warranted to consolidate the utility of IVVS as a treatment modality for pelvic floor dysfunction. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: Postpartum urinary retention is a frequent complication after childbirth. It is usually a temporary condition. However, unrecognised urinary retention can lead to considerable morbidity due to bladder over distention, detrusor atony and long term voiding dysfunction. In our clinic we noticed an overestimation of post void residual measured with the BladderScan® in comparison with catheterization in women one week after delivery. Study design: We included 25 women in this prospective pilot study. These women had a urinary retention over 1000 ml within 4–5 h postpartum. Conform our local protocol, an indwelling catheter was inserted for one week. After removal of the indwelling catheter, a micturition trial was conducted. The post void residual was first measured with BladderScan® (BVI 3000), directly followed by clean intermittent catheterization which is the golden standard at this moment. Results: There was a significant mean difference in post void residual measurements with the BladderScan® and catheterization of 312 ml (95% CI 220–404 ml) (p &lt; 0.001). According to our post void residual definition of 200 ml, the sensitivity and specificity of the BladderScan® was respectively 100% and 17.6%. The positive predictive value was 36%. Conclusion: The BladderScan® (BVI 3000) is a non-reliable instrument to measure post void residual one week postpartum. For now clean intermittent catherization remains the golden standard. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Women with thalassaemia major typically experience hypogonadotropic hypogonadism because of the toxic effects of iron overload on the anterior pituitary. Moreover, in affected women, serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and antral follicle count (AFC) are also shown to be reduced, suggesting that the peripheral excess of iron could also harm the ovarian reserve. To date, the detrimental effects of the disease on oocyte quality have not been investigated. Materials and methods: Women with thalassaemia major who underwent in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles were retrospectively identified over a 9 years period. They were matched (with a 1:5 ratio) by study period and age to a control group of infertile women undergoing IVF. Embriological variables were compared between the two groups. The primary outcome was the rate of top quality embryos. Results: Twenty-one women with thalassaemia major (exposed group) and 105 controls (unexposed group) were ultimately included. Serum AMH was 0.6 [0.2–1.8] and 1.5 [0.7–3.5] ng/ml, respectively (p = 0.05). AFC was 4 (1–7.5) and 11 (5.5–16), respectively (p < 0.001). The total dose of gonadotropins used was higher in exposed women but the number of retrieved oocytes and oocytes used did not differ. The fertilization rate was higher in exposed compared to unexposed women, being 100% (76–100%) and 75% (50–100%). respectively (p = 0.03). The cleavage rate was also higher, being 75% (39–100%) and 50% (29–64%), respectively (p = 0.04). In contrast, the rate of top quality embryos did not differ, being 20% (0–76%) and 25% (5–50%), respectively (p = 0.98). Conclusions: Despite lower ovarian reserve, oocyte quality is not significantly affected in women with thalassaemia major. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: Surveys of the general population regarding sex selection using pre-implantation genetic diagnosis are limited and were mainly conducted in the United States and Northern Europe. In those Western societies, surveys have shown that people's interest in using sex selection techniques is encouraged by the desire for a sexually balanced family. It is important to determine attitudes to sex selection in a wider range of countries especially that cultural differences exist among countries. Study design: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study regarding attitudes towards sex selection for non-medical reasons was designed. One thousand five hundred participants of the reproductive age group presenting to the Women s Health Center at the American University of Beirut Medical Center were offered to complete the survey. The questionnaire included demographic details, obstetric and infertility history, opinions regarding sex selection, personal interest in expanding the family, and personal interest in choosing the sex of a future child. Results: The response rate was 86.6%. Nineteen per cent of the respondents considered it strictly prohibited, 38.8% considered the technique acceptable only if medically indicated while 33.4% believed that it should be available to all those who request it. Multivariate logistic regression on the predictors of the variable affecting the attitudes towards sex selection showed that the educational level, religious disapproval and the desire of the opposite sex of the already existing children were the only significant predictors. Conclusion: The middle-eastern multi-religious population studied has a negative attitude towards sex selection through pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. Religion, educational status and desire of children of both genders were identified as the significant predictors of the decision whether to accept sex selection or not. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Over the past two decades, there has been a rapid evolution in prenatal screening for fetal chromosome abnormalities. Initially, testing was focused on the identification of affected pregnancies in either the first, or, the second trimester (e.g. the Combined test or the triple test). This was replaced by sequential modalities (e.g. contingent screening)that have enhanced detection while reducing the need for invasive testing. More recently, the introduction of technologies based on cell-free DNA (cfDNA)in maternal plasma and enrichment of fetal cells in maternal circulation have further refined the concept of sequential screening. In this review, we document our experience with serum and ultrasound-based contingent screening where we were able to achieve a detection rate of 96.8%, a false-positive rate of 2.8% and an odds of being affected given a positive result of 1:11. We also describe our initial experience with a novel sequential protocol that includes the analysis of fetal cells in maternal blood. Methods for enrichment for fetal cells cfDNA and cfDNA technologies offer the possibility of greater sensitivity and specificity as well as expansion in the scope of genetic disorders detectable. As costs decline, these technologies will become increasingly used as primary screening tools. In the meantime, sequential use offers a practical approach to maximizing the benefits of prenatal testing. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: Circulating levels of the anti-angiogenic factors sFlt-1 and sEndoglin are elevated in preeclampsia (PE)and fetal growth restriction (FGR), mainly secreted from placental trophoblast. This study aims to identify the contributory role of monocyte Flt-1 and endoglin expression in PE and FGR. Study design: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted and patients recruited from four clinical groups including normal pregnancy, PE, FGR and PE + FGR. Peripheral blood samples and cord blood were collected from 54 pregnant women between 24–40 weeks of gestation. Monocyte subset distribution was assessed using CD14 and CD16 expression and the surface expression of Flt-1, endoglin, CD86 and CD163 assessed by flow cytometry. We compared these factors between (1)clinical groups. (2)monocyte subset (3)monocyte polarization and (4)gestational age. Results: Across all clinical groups, Flt-1 was mainly expressed by classical and intermediate monocytes, but no differences between clinical groups were observed. Surface expression of endoglin was higher on intermediate and non-classical monocytes and decreased in PE + FGR total monocytes. Flt-1 and endoglin expression correlated with increasing gestational age as well as higher CD86/CD163 ratio favouring M1 polarisation. The fetal monocyte endoglin expression was increased in FGR. Conclusion: We conclude that monocyte Flt-1 and endoglin expression increase with gestational age and with M1 polarization suggesting their upregulation with inflammatory changes in monocytes. Endoglin expression by M1 monocytes may play a part in increased cardiovascular risk associated with preeclampsia. Endoglin expression on fetal monocytes is increased in FGR as a likely response to placental injury. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objective: Ovarian cancer (OC) was one of the deadliest gynecological malignancy among women in global. Serum microRNAs (miRNAs) could serve as promising diagnostic biomarkers for patients with OC. Study design: Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) based Exiqon panel, we identified 27 differentially expressed miRNAs from one normal control (NC) pool and two OC pool samples in the initial screening stage. We further verified the miRNAs in the training (30 OC VS. 36 NCs) and validation stages (80 OC VS. 80 NCs) based on qRT-PCR. Later, the expression levels of the identified miRNAs were also evaluated in exosomes and tissues. Results: We found a serum microRNA signature including five overexpressed miRNAs (miR-200c-3p, miR-346, miR-127-3p, miR-143-3p and miR-205-5p) in OC in comparison with NCs. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of the five-miRNA panel were 0.783 for the training stage and 0.745 for the validation stage. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the combined five-miRNA panel was 0.818 and 0.609 when the cut-off value was 0.636. The levels of miR-200c-3p, miR-346 and miR-127-3p in serum were related to tumor grade and distant metastasis of OC. The expression levels of the five miRNAs were also significantly up-regulated in serum exosomes (32 OC VS. 32 NCs). Furthermore, miR-200c-3p was significantly elevated in OC tissues (22 OC VS. 22 NCs). But the levels of the miR-346 and miR-143-3p were significantly lower in OC tissues. Conclusion: Our findings showed a five-miRNA panel in serum for the detection of OC. Moreover, serum expression levels of miR-200c-3p, miR-346 and miR-127-3p were concerned with tumor grade and distant metastasis of OC. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: Despite a quite large number of papers in literature, the current incidence of pregnancy associated cancer still remains uncertain. Moreover, different inclusion criteria and time intervals considered after delivery make these data poorly comparable. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of PACs in Apulia, an Italian region, while stressing differences or similarities with other populations. Study design: We collected 682,173 pregnancies from national discharge forms, regarding hospitals in Apulia from January 2003 to December 2015. Our aim was not only to obtain the raw incidence of PACs but also to estimate the odds ratio (OR)for some potential risk predictors such as calendar year, age, nationality and pregnancy outcome using a logistic model. Women were sorted into different groups by age (<30, 30–34, 35–39, >=40)and by nationality (Italian or foreign nationals). Each pregnancy had two possible outcomes: delivery or abortion. Results: We achieved a final cohort of 867 PACs: therefore, the raw incidence is 127.1 per 100,000 pregnancies. Breast cancer was the most common cancer (37.7 cases per 100,000 pregnancies)and as a typical feature in our population thyroid cancers followed it by incidence (22.3 per 100,000 pregnancies). Cervical cancer is, as expected, the first gynaecological cancer by incidence(3.8 per 100,000). Younger women have the lowest risk for PACs (64.5 per 100,000, OR = 1)while the highest risk for PACs was for women aged >=40 years (OR = 4.29, p < 0.05). Considering calendar years, we observed an increased OR from 2006 to 2009 (OR = 1.39 and OR = 1.41 respectively)without spotting a trend throughout the whole decade. Conclusions: The ranking of each tumour by incidence more or less reflects its demographics in reproductive age females in western countries and the incidence for any cancer is expected to grow as the rate of first deliveries in older women continues to rise. We reported noticeable differences regarding the incidence of some cancers (such as thyroid cancer)with previous literature, reflecting an epidemiologic feature of our cohort. Women older than 40 years have a more than fourfold risk for oncologic diagnosis during pregnancy, and this finding is of pivotal clinical and social importance because of the tendency of women living in developed countries to postpone childbearing. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: Controlled Ovarian Stimulation (COS) for In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) or Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) is considered as an assisted reproduction technology. There are established structural and biological differences between both ovaries which may affect their responsiveness to COS. Whether the right or the left ovary responds superior to COS is a question which is unresolved in the literature. Study design: The present study was conducted as a prospective observational to make a comparison between right and left ovaries’ oocytes based on oocyte quality and follicular fluid estradiol level. A total of 100 infertile women who had referred to Infertility and Reproductive Health Research center at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, were investigated. Results: The total number of very good and good oocytes were 63.01% vs. 50.3%, and immature and interstitial oocytes were 36.99% vs. 49.6% in the right and the left ovaries, respectively. There were no significant differences between oocyte rates between the two ovaries (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Good and very good quality oocytes and fertilization rate (P < 0.001) are higher in the right ovary compared with the left ovary; however, no significant difference was observed between the right and the left ovaries in oocyte yields and cleavage rates. Moreover, despite higher follicular estradiol levels in the left ovary, there was no relationship noticed between follicular fluid estradiol and oocyte quality among oocytes of each ovary. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: This study aims to elucidate which types of recurrent miscarriage (RM) patients experienced a livebirth after paternal lymphocyte immunotherapy (LIT) and to evaluate the perinatal outcome. Study design: Retrospective analysis of a multicenter, observational study which enrolled 1096 couples with a history of two or more spontaneous miscarriages without any intercalated delivery. We conducted an intention-to-treat analysis of couples with RM treated with or without LIT regarding to gestational and perinatal outcomes. We compared groups by using the Student's t-test or Kruskal–Wallis test, Fisher's exact-test and χ2 test when appropriate. Results: The success of gestation was significantly higher in the LIT group (60.1% vs. 33.1%; p &lt; 0.001). A sub-analysis of four different immune disorder groups revealed a significantly higher success in the LIT group in all immune categories, except in patients who had autoantibodies positive. We observed no significant differences in perinatal outcomes such as gestational age at birth, preterm and extreme preterm birth, and birth weight in successful pregnancy in both groups. The success rate was significantly higher when LIT was administrated before and during pregnancy and only during pregnancy compared to only before pregnancy (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: Careful laboratory test phenotyping of RM patients may identify subgroups most likely to benefit and exclude those with little likelihood of benefit, and LIT during a pregnancy may significantly improve success rates. © 2019},

abstract={Objective(s): To assess changes in quality of life after laparoscopic removal of Essure® sterilization devices (Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany). Study Design: In this prospective observational study in an academic research hospital, 80 women with new or worsening symptoms since placement of Essure® sterilization devices undergoing subsequent surgical removal were included. Laparoscopic removal of Essure® devices and salpingectomy with or without cornual excision were performed. Concomitant uterine procedures could be associated where indicated for gynaecological complaints. Comparison using the T student test for coupled series was done in this before-and-after study. Results: Health related quality of life (HRQL)was the primary outcome measured by the Short Form 12 (SF-12)questionnaire and a global 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included assessment of pain, using continuous (VAS)and ordinal scales (Modified McGill Pain Questionnaire), menstrual bleeding (pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC)score)and surgical feasibility and safety. There was a significant improvement in quality of life in both mental and physical health aspects of the SF-12 (34.02 (+/−1.19)vs. 49.61 (+/−1.42, P &lt;.0001)and 36.55 (+/−0.99)vs. 43.32 (+/−1.18, P &lt;.0001 respectively)as well as global VAS assessment (+2.91 (SD +/−0.27))at the end of the first post-operative month. These improvements were maintained at three and six months. Mean pain decreased at one month following surgery compared to baseline (VAS 3.6 (+/−0.36)to 1.4 (+/−0.25), P &lt;.0001 and McGill pain score 18.70 (+/−1.88)to 4.73 (+/−0.90), P &lt;.0001). Improvements of a similar magnitude were observed when analysis was restricted to the 47 women without concomitant uterine surgery. No significant changes in bleeding were seen following of Essure® device removal. Planned procedures were all successfully completed. Conclusion: Laparoscopic removal of Essure® devices in symptomatic women is technically successful and associated with short and medium-term improvement in quality of life as well as reduction in pelvic pain. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: C-type lectin domain family 2, member D (CLEC2D)is implicated in the immune response. Pre-eclampsia and HIV infection have opposing immune responses. In view of the high prevalence of HIV infection and pre-eclampsia in South Africa, this study assessed the placental immuno-expression of CLEC2D in HIV associated pre-eclampsia. Method: Placental tissue was obtained from 60 pregnancies which were categorized according to pregnancy type (pre-eclamptic or normotensive)and HIV status (positive or negative). Immunohistochemistry and morphometric image analysis were used to evaluate placental CLEC2D immuno-expression. Results: CLEC2D expression was significantly decreased in the conducting villi of pre-eclamptic vs normotensive placentae (p = 0.0418)but was increased in the exchange villi, albeit non-significant (p = 0.4948). HIV positive status intensified placental CLEC2D immuno-expression in conducting (p = 0.0312)and exchange (p = 0.0025)villi. CLEC2D expression was significantly different in exchange vs conducting villi (p < 0.0001)and across study groups (p = 0.0003). Normotensive; HIV negative placentae (control)had a non-significant difference in CLEC2D expression across villi types, however significant difference was noted within the remaining groups: normotensive; HIV positive (p < 0.05), pre-eclamptic; HIV positive (p < 0.01 and pre-eclamptic; HIV negative (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The contrasting expression of CLEC2D in HIV infection and pre-eclampsia is demonstrative of the immunosuppressive and pro-inflammatory roles of the respective pathologies. However, this implication may be confounded by highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART). © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Objective: To compare complication rates following amniocentesis in twin gestations, according to sampling technique and number of needle insertions. Study design: A retrospective cohort study of all women with twin gestations who underwent amniocentesis and delivered in a single university affiliated medical center during 2002−2016. Amniocentesis was performed either through one uterine entry with passage through the inter-twin membrane or through two different entries to the two amniotic sacs. Pregnancy outcome of women that underwent single needle insertion amniocentesis, was compared to this of double needle insertion. Primary outcome was neonatal complications within 4 weeks after amniocentesis (late abortion, chorioamnionitis, preterm premature rupture of membranes, or hospitalization due to related symptoms). Secondary outcomes were gestational week at delivery and labor characteristics. Results: The study group comprised 212 women. Of them, 73 (34.4%) underwent a single uterine insertion and 139 (65.6%) two separate needle insertions. Baseline characteristics did not differ between the groups. The amniocentesis complication rate was 13.7% in the single insertion group and 16.5% in the double insertion group (p = 0.587). Multivariate analysis found that a single insertion method had no statistically significant influence on complication rate, after making adjustments for potential confounders (OR = 1.085, 95% CI 0.4–2.9; p = 0.871). Other labor characteristics were similar between the groups. Conclusion: Needle insertion technique in twin gestation amniocentesis was not associated with procedure related complications. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To assess sleep disorders (SleD)in women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (FHA)and to identify possible associations with known FHA predisposing factors. Study design: We conducted a prospective case-control study spanning the period January 2016 to April 2018. We recruited forty-one FHA women and 86 healthy controls. We assessed SleD and other FHA predisposing factors via self-reported questionnaires. The Spearman's correlation coefficient (rho)was used to examine possible correlations among the different variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent factors associated with SleD. Results: Women with FHA reported having higher SleD (p = 0.004), abnormal eating attitudes (p < 0.0001), higher anxiety levels (AL)(p < 0.0001), overweight preoccupation (P < 0.0001)and increased weekly physical activity (p = 0.004). There was a significant positive correlation between SleD and AL (rho = 0.88, p < 0.0001). Significant correlation was also found between AL and several Athens insomnia scale constituents, including sleep induction (rho = 0.53, p = 0.0004), awakenings during the night (rho = 0.6, p < 0.0001), final awakening (rho = 0.42, p = 0.006), total sleep duration (rho = 0.64, p < 0.0001), quality of sleep (rho = 0.63, p < 0.0001), well-being during the day (rho = 0.34, p = 0.03)and sleepiness during the day (rho = 0.51, p = 0.007). High AL were correlated with 2.83-fold increased SleD risk (p = 0.04). Conclusion: FHA women are seemingly more prone to SleD and those with SleD suffer from higher AL. In view of this evidence, the potential rationale of adding psychological and SleD evaluation to their clinical care is highlighted. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: To investigate the correlation between the numerical rating scale, visual analogue scale, and pressure threshold by algometry in women with chronic pelvic pain. Study design: This was a cross-sectional study. We included 47 patients with chronic pelvic pain. All subjects underwent a pain assessment that used three different methods and were divided according to the cause of pain (endometriosis versus non-endometriosis). Moreover, we assessed the agreement between the scales (visual, analogue and algometry) using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The ICC for the numeric rating scale and the visual analogue scale regarding pain (0.992), dysmenorrhea (1.00) and dyspareunia (0.996) were strong. The agreement between the scales was excellent (p ≤0.01). The correlation between algometry and the scales showed a moderate and inverse association, and this correlation was statistically significant: as the scores on the numeric rating scale and the visual analogue scale regarding dyspareunia increased, the algometry thresholds decreased. Conclusions: The assessment of women with chronic pelvic pain should combine pressure algometry and the numeric rating scale or the visual analogue scale, because of their inverse correlations and satisfactory reliability and sensitivity, to make pain assessment less subjective and more accurate. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective(s): To study if the GnRH agonist administration in luteal phase improves clinical pregnancy rate of fresh and frozen embryo transfer. Also, this meta-analysis compares the treatment effect of luteal GnRH agonist administration between long agonist and antagonist protocols of fresh cycles, and between two types of treatment: fresh and frozen embryo transfers. Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis (registration number CRD42017059152) Results: For the overall 20 studies (5497 patients), clinical pregnancy rate significantly increased in group of GnRH agonist administration compared to control group (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.14–1.34, p < 0.0001). Regarding the treatment effect of luteal GnRH agonist administration between long agonist and antagonist protocol fresh cycles, no significant difference was observed (RR = 1.28, 95% CI 0.98–1.67, p = 0.07). Also, in comparison between fresh and frozen embryo transfer, similar effect of GnRH agonist administration was found (RR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.74–1.16, p = 0.49). Conclusion(s): There is evidence that GnRH agonist administration in luteal phase improve clinical pregnancy rate in both fresh and frozen cycles. Within fresh cycles, no significant difference of clinical pregnancy rate is found between two protocols. In frozen cycles, the effect of GnRH agonist administration in enhancing clinical pregnancy rate is similar to fresh cycles. © 2019 The Author},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the impact of age-specific anti-Mullerian (AMH) levels on the cumulative live birth rate after 4 intra uterine inseminations (IUI). Study Design: The retrospective study study involved 509 couples who underwent their first IUI between January 2011 and July 2017 in the Toulouse University Hospital. All IUI were performed after an ovarian stimulation combining recombinant FSH and GnRH antagonist. The main measure outcome was the cumulative live birth rate (LBR) defined as the number of deliveries with at least one live birth resulting from a maximum of 4 IUI attempts. Results: When compared to normal or high levels, low age-specific AMH (<25th of the AMH in each age group) was associated to a non-significant lower live birth rate (31%, 38% and 42% respectively for low, normal and high age-specific groups; P = 0.170) and non-significant higher miscarriage rate (26%; 19% and 14% respectively for low, normal and high age-specific groups; P = 0.209). However, it must be pointed out that in low age-specific AMH the initial FSH doses used for stimulation were higher than in the other groups. Conclusion: This study shows that the age-specific levels of AMH have only a slight effect on IUI outcome when adapting the stimulation protocols to their level. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of induction of labour in obese women using sequential double-balloon catheter and oral misoprostol in comparison with oral misoprostol alone. Study design: In this cohort study, 400 pregnant women with BMI higher than 35 kg/m2 undergoing labour induction at term were included. Induction of labour with a double-balloon catheter and, if necessary, sequential oral misoprostol (n = 216) was compared to oral misoprostol alone (n = 184). The primary outcome measure was the caesarean section rate. Secondary outcome parameters were, among others, the induction-to-delivery-interval, the rate of vaginal delivery within 24 and 48 h as well as fetal outcome parameters. Results: The caesarean section rate was significantly lower in the group with sequential use of double-balloon catheter and oral misoprostol (27.6% versus 37.5%, p = 0.0345). After stratification for parity this reduction was seen especially in nulliparous (38.6% versus 56.9%, p = 0.0039). The rate of abnormal CTG was significantly lower as well (19.9% versus 30.4%, p = 0.0150), particularly in nulliparous (25.9% versus 40.4%, p = 0.0138). Uni- and multivariable analyzes showed that the caesarean section rate was significantly influenced by the method of induction of labour (p = 0.0026), parity (p < 0.0001) and Bishop score (p = 0.0425). Conclusion: In obese women, induction of labour with sequential use of double-balloon catheter and oral misoprostol is associated with significantly more normal vaginal deliveries and less caesarean sections. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety between laparoscopy and local injection with absolute ethanol (AE)for treating tubal ectopic pregnancy (EP). Study design: Retrospective cohort study of ectopic pregnancies in the fallopian tube from two tertiary hospitals between January 2015 and December 2017. Clinical information such as presenting symptoms, reproductive history, possible risk factors, initial diagnosis, serum beta-human chor-ionic gonadotropin (β-HCG)level, transvaginal ultrasonography findings, methods of treatment and outcomes were reviewed and analyzed. Results: A total of 119 patients were identified for this study. The diagnosis was based on clinical manifestations, ultrasonography scan and dynamic serum β-HCG. 71.4% of women (85/119)had at least one risk factor for ectopic pregnancy, with the most common risk factors being a history of induced labor, uterine curettage, spontaneous abortion or tubal pregnancy. 64 patients were managed by laparoscopic surgery (Group A)and 2 subjects were failure and followed by a systemic methotrexate (MTX)prescription. The other 55 patients had local injection with absolute ethanol, of which 9 cases failed, followed by a second local injection and intramuscular MTX. The HCG decrease rate post absolute ethanol injection was a value predictive factor for prognosis. Moreover, the pregnancy rate one-year post treatment in local injection subjects (10/55, 18.2%)was higher than that of surgical subjects (5/64, 7.8%). Conclusion: Local injection of absolute ethanol and laparoscopic surgery for tubal ectopic pregnancy are both effective and relatively safe, but laparoscopic surgery has better efficacy and shorten hospitalization day. Local injection may be less invasiveness and thus beneficial to fertility preservation. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: Endometriosis has a complex and multifactorial pathology, and it is considered one of the main causes of infertility nowadays. The angiogenic process, which involves remodeling of extracellular matrix, is crucial for the development of this disease, mainly by the action of the matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3). It is known that genetic factors can influence endometriosis, thus; we investigated the role of MMP3 276G>A polymorphism as a risk factor for the development of the disease and its symptoms. Study Design: This case-control study included 283 women with endometriosis (cases)and 217 women without the disease (controls)who were submitted to laparoscopic or laparotomy surgery. Real-time polymerase chain reaction performed by TaqMan system was applied for all polymorphisms. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between polymorphism and endometriosis or clinical and gynecological characteristics of the disease, using their respective odds ratios (OR)and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: The allelic frequency of the MMP3 276 G > A polymorphism was 33.6% in controls and 40.3% in endometriosis cases. The allelic distribution was significantly different between the two (P = 0.03). The variant genotype of MMP3 276AA was associated with increased endometriosis risk in the advanced endometriosis cases (OR: 2.08, 95% CI: 1.05 – 4.07 and OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.01 – 3.45). Regarding the symptoms, endometriosis-related infertile women had a positive association with the presence of MMP3 276 G > A polymorphism (OR: 3.13, 95% CI: 1.08–9.08 and OR: 3.30, 95% CI: 1.31 – 8.33). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the MMP3 276A polymorphism is involved with advanced endometriosis cases and infertility, and these associations may implicate in the behavior of disease. © 2019},

abstract={Objectives: To assess the effect of transcervical endometrial resection on clinical symptoms related to histopathological findings of the junctional zone. Study design: This prospective study took place at a university hospital. Premenopausal women suffering from abnormal uterine bleeding and/or pelvic pain and scheduled for transcervical endometrial resection were enrolled (n = 112). Histopathological findings of the endomyometrial biopsies were categorized as follows: Adenomyosis of the inner myometrium (intrinsic adenomyosis): ≥ 2 mm myometrial invasion without contact to the basal endometrium, serrated junctional zone: > 3 mm myometrial invasion with contact to the basal endometrium and linear junctional zone: No or marginal myometrial invasion (≤ 3 mm)with contact to the basal endometrium. All study participants received a baseline and two follow-up questionnaires (6 and 18 months after surgery)regarding symptom severity, health-related quality of life and pelvic pain. Data regarding reintervention surgery was obtained from the National Database Patoweb. The rate of reintervention surgery and the improvement in symptom severity, health-related quality of life and pelvic pain were correlated to histopathological findings. Results: Twenty-four patients had intrinsic adenomyosis, 31 had serrated junctional zone and 57 had linear junctional zone. Fifteen patients (13%)underwent reintervention surgery; three (20%)within 6 months, nine (60%)between 6–18 months and three (20%)> 18 months after transcervical endometrial resection. Reintervention surgery was more common in women with intrinsic adenomyosis compared to women without (33% (95% CI: 16–55)vs 8% (95% CI: 3–16))(p-value: <.05). Nine patients (38%)with intrinsic adenomyosis were asymptomatic based on low symptom severity score, high health-related quality of life and no pelvic pain at 18 months follow-up. Patients with linear junctional zone had a higher improvement in symptom severity and health-related quality of life than patients with intrinsic adenomyosis or serrated junctional zone at 6 months follow-up after surgery (p-value <.05). However, there was no significant difference in pelvic pain reduction. Conclusion: The effect of transcervical endometrial resection may depend upon the degree of junctional zone changes, and patients with intrinsic adenomyosis are more likely to undergo reintervention surgery than patients with either linear or serrated junctional zone. However, intrinsic adenomyosis may also be successfully treated with endometrial resection. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV)is recognized as the main risk factor of cervical cancer. Investigation via cytology and colposcopy have lower sensitivity than HPV testing in the diagnosis of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+). Despite normal cytology and colposcopy findings women with persistent HPV infection have an increased risk of CIN2+. The aim of the study was to evaluate the proportion of histologically confirmed CIN2+ in women with persistent HPV infection and normal Pap smears. Study design: From April 2013 until March 2016 we prospectively recruited 91 women over 40 years with persistent HPV infection without any abnormalities in cytology. Of these, 40 women attended a gynecological examination including an HPV test, Pap smear, endocervical cytology, colposcopy with biopsies and diagnostic loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Biopsy and LEEP samples were subjected to histological examination Results: CIN2+ was verified by histological examination of the LEEP sample in 6/40 (15%)of the women. All the cytological samples were normal and none of the biopsies confirmed CIN2+. Only 19/40 women still had a persistent HPV infection at the study visit. None of the 21/40 women who had cleared their HPV infection at the study visit had CIN2+ in histology of the LEEP sample. Conclusions: A persistent HPV infection needs to be monitored despite normal Pap smears, since 6/40 (15%)women older than 40 years, was revealed to have an undiagnosed CIN2+ when LEEP was performed. Counseling women regarding the risk of cervical cancer and the expected effect of an eventual LEEP can help them to make an optimal informed choice. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Background: Obstetric cholestasis is a condition occurring in pregnancy with suspected adverse perinatal outcomes. Stillbirth is a significant adverse event associated with obstetric cholestasis and considered for intervention in pregnancy. Objectives: There are multiple studies with epidemiological data with regards to the outcomes of obstetric cholestasis. Our hypothesis is to the test the association of stillbirth and related outcomes in obstetric cholestasis. Search Strategy & Selection criteria: Two independent reviewers did independent searches and selection with a standardized design as outlined in the PRISMA statement. Analysis: The retrieved relevant literature was subjected to a rigorous quality assessment and followed by standardized interpretable results. Results: The pooled estimate in this study showed that there was no significant difference in the stillbirth rates in the obstetric (OC) population when compared to the non-obstetric cholestasis (reference) population. However, there was an increased risk of preterm birth in the OC population compared to the reference population; however, the cesarean section and induction of labor results were directly related. Discussion: This study provides an epidemiological data related to the perinatal outcomes associated with obstetric cholestasis, specifically stillbirth. This result is likely to produce a benchmark for current evidence-based practice and to assist future research in understanding the implication of associated stillbirth risk and related outcomes with OC. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: The discovery of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA)fragments in maternal plasma made it possible to determine fetal sex at early stages of pregnancy without carrying a risk miscarriage, which is especially important for the management of X-linked genetic abnormalities. The vast majority of studies used cffDNA extracted from maternal venous blood, excluding the possibility of capillary sampling for those who cannot tolerate venipuncture. This study evaluates the possibility of fetal sex determination using cffDNA isolated from capillary blood of women with early gestational pregnancies. Study design: Samples were obtained from 24 pregnant women from the Ukrainian population, whose gestational age varied between 5th to 10th weeks. Sex determination was performed using real-time quantitative PCR of SRY male-specific markers. Results were compared to the known fetal sex (detected by next-generation sequencing during the preimplantation genetic testing procedure)to calculate the test accuracy. Results: Results demonstrated 85.71–100% sensitivity and 100% specificity of the test. Cohen's Kappa coefficient of agreement in sex determination test varied from 0.8 to 1.0 (P < 0.00001). Conclusion: This test, which is the first known so far detailed report of successful early fetal sex determination using cffDNA isolated from maternal capillary blood, is a reliable alternative to traditional venipuncture. © 2019},

abstract={Maternal Graves’ disease is the most common cause of fetal goiter. Fetal goiter can cause complications attributable either to the physical effects of the goiter itself or to thyroid dysfunction, which can be life-threatening and cause neurological impairment. Determining whether a goiter is caused by fetal hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism is the main clinical problem, and in utero evaluations and management are essential. Ultrasonography combined with color Doppler and magnetic resonance imaging are helpful for the initial diagnosis and monitoring, but these imaging techniques have a limited ability to discriminate between fetal hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. To determine the fetal thyroid status, fetal blood sampling using cordocentesis is reliable but hazardous, and the indications must be considered carefully. Amniocentesis is an easier and safer alternative, but the correlations between the amniotic fluid and fetal serum thyroid hormone levels remain unclear. If a fetal goiter is accompanied by hypothyroidism, administering thyroid hormone intra-amniotically may be effective and relatively safe. However, the wide variety of approaches to treatment exemplifies the lack of guidelines, and no systematic studies have been conducted to date. Therefore, intrauterine treatment should be reserved for selected patients at a high risk of complications. Moreover, when intrauterine treatment fails and a fetal goiter can cause airway obstruction, intrapartum management, such as ex utero intrapartum treatment, may be required; however, reports describing the use of this procedure for fetal goiter are limited. This review summarizes the current knowledge about fetal goiter associated with maternal Graves’ disease and evaluates the most significant new findings regarding its in utero and peripartum management. © 2019},

abstract={Study Objective: To describe complications following surgery for deep endometriosis (DE) without bowel involvement and to develop a nomogram for predicting postoperative complications. Design: Retrospective study Setting: Tertiary referral university hospital and expert center in endometriosis Patients: Two-hundred and twenty patients with DE without bowel involvement Interventions: Laparoscopic resection for DE without bowel involvement Measurements and Main Results: Operative complications were evaluated using the Clavien-Dindo classification. Voiding dysfunction was defined as a need for bladder self-catheterization lasting >1 month. Fifty-three patients (24%) had postoperative complications: 31 (14%) had a Clavien-Dindo grade I[sbnd]II complication (3 grade I and 28 grade II); 11 (5%) had a grade III complication (2 grade IIIa and 9 grade IIIb); and 11 (5%) had voiding dysfunction. No grade IV[sbnd]V complications were observed. Age, Enzian classification risk group, and previous surgery for endometriosis were significantly associated with postoperative complications. The predictive model had an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.70–0.74) before and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.68–72) after bootstrap sample correction. The average difference and maximal difference in predicted and calibrated probabilities of recurrence were 0.023 and 0.089% respectively Conclusion: Surgery for DE without bowel resection is associated with a relatively high incidence of voiding dysfunction and postoperative complications mainly corresponding to Clavien-Dindo grade I[sbnd]II. Age, risk group of Enzian classification, and previous surgery for endometriosis are significantly associated with postoperative complications and voiding dysfunction.

abstract={Objective: Hormonal changes experience by women produce significant changes in the periodontium. The aim of this study is to assess whether menopausal hormone therapy, in patients diagnosed with moderate chronic periodontitis and menopause presents a beneficial effect, in terms of clinical and immunological outcomes. Study design: Thirty subjects with moderate chronic periodontitis and menopause were selected and assigned to two groups in accordance to the presence of menopausal hormone therapy. Periodontal clinical parameters, microbiological samples and immunological variables were assessed in both groups. Inter-group differences were evaluated using non-paired Student t-tests and chi square tests. Also, Pearson coefficient correlation was performed to determine the correlation between variables. Results: There were statistically significant differences between groups for clinical attachment level, probing pocket depth, interleukin 1β and interleukin 6. Smoking habit, deeper PPD and higher Il-6 levels in non-menopausal hormone therapy users group, tend to increase the interleukin 1ß GCF levels. These findings were supported by serum estrogen levels. The variables levels were higher in the menopausal hormone therapy users group. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the present study, the hypothesis that menopausal hormone therapy user's women will show better periodontal status and differences in immunological variables respect to those being non-menopausal hormone therapy users was supported. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To evaluate the indication and performance of systematic lymphadenectomy (SL) in Stage I endometrioid endometrial carcinoma (EEC), at intermediate risk (FIGO IAG2/G3, IBG1/G2) on recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS) and survival. Study design: 194 women underwent hysterectomies by laparotomy, with SL (n = 95) or without SL (n = 99) between 1990 and 2014 was evaluated. Diagnosis period, age, BMI, comorbidities, stage, and adjuvant radiotherapy were analyzed. DFS and cancer-specific survival were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test, and recurrences by Cox regression. Results: SL was performed in 93% (41/44) of women managed before 1998 and decreasing after that (p &lt; 0.001). SL was also more frequent if BMI under 35.0 kg/m2 (p &lt; 0.001) and in women without comorbidities (p = 0.017). Distribution of age, stage and postoperative radiotherapy were not different between groups. There were 14 recurrences (7.4%), concentrated in the SL group (12 cases) and associated with Stage IAG3 (35.7%, p = 0.009). Longitudinal evaluation exhibited 95% of 5-year cancer-specific survival rate for non-SL group vs. 88% for the SL group (p = 0.039), and DFS rate was 97% for the non-SL group vs. 85% for the SL group (p = 0.004). Cox regression analyses exhibited Stage IAG3 (HR 6.48, IC95% 1.88–22.39; p = 0.003) associated with less DFS. Conclusion: SL in surgical staging of EEC at intermediate risk presented no benefits regarding recurrences, DFS, and cancer-specific survival rate when compared to patients not submitted to complete surgical staging. Stage IAG3 had poor prognosis regardless treatment modality. Our results provide further evidence to support the current trend to avoid SL in the surgical approach to selected women. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To analyze the polymorphism -1171 5A / 6A rs3025058 of the MMP-3 gene and the risk for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Study Design: This is a cohort study. All patients attended the Urogynecology and Vaginal Surgery Section of the FMABC, from 2014 to 2016 and they were randomly recruited by the researchers at the first medical appointment. We selected 112 patients with symptomatic POPs and 180 patients with normal pelvic floors. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)5A / 6A of MMP-3 was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)and analysis of the restriction fragments in both groups. Chi-squared test was used to compare the frequencies of polymorphisms between the groups. For those characteristics with statistical relevance, the crude odds ratio (OR)and its respective 95% confidence intervals were calculated; and, by logistic regression, were adjusted for each of the other characteristics, obtaining the adjusted OR. Hardy-Weinberg gene balance was determined using Pearson's Chi-squared test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Logistic regression of factors associated with genital prolapse showed that age (adjusted OR = 11.89, 95% CI, 3.53–40)and home delivery (adjusted OR = 9.645, 95% CI, 3.35–27.7)remained risk factors for genital prolapse in the sample studied. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the distribution of genotypes, even after calculating the contribution of the 5A recessive allele in the aggregated genotypes (5A / 5A + 5A / 6A). Conclusion: The polymorphism -1171 5A / 6A rs3025058 of the MMP-3 gene was not associated with the risk for POP. Age and home delivery were significantly associated with increased risk for the disease. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To examine the trend of cesarean delivery (CD)rate among twin pregnancies and the trend in maternal and neonatal morbidities within two decades. Study design: Population-based cohort study, conducted at a single teaching hospital in Israel on data between January 1995 and December 2015. All pregnant women with twin gestation who delivered at a gestational age of 24 weeks or more were included. Data on mode of deliveries, Apgar score <7 at 5 min, cord artery pH < 7.1, early postpartum hemorrhage, blood transfusion, and intrapartum fever for each year were extracted and plotted, and trends were analyzed. CDs performed for one or both twins were divided to laboring, i.e., after a trial of labor, and non-laboring CDs. Data was obtained from the hospital discharge register with ICD-9 codes and crosschecked with the labor medical records. The Cochran-Armitage Trend Test was used to identify trends and correlations. Results: Of all 88,145 deliveries that took place during this period, 1955 (2.2%)were twins. Of these 53 were ineligible and were excluded. There was a statistically significant trend (increase)in twins birth over time (p = 0.004). CD rate increased significantly from 43.4% in 1995 to 66.0% in 2015 (p = 0.001). This increase was observed only among non-laboring cesareans (p = 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that maternal and early neonatal morbidities examined did not differ significantly during the study period. Conclusion: Non-laboring CD rate increased significantly over the past two decades among twin pregnancies. Despite this increase, maternal and early neonatal morbidities did not change. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Reducing preterm birth is a priority for Maternity and Children's services. In the recent UK Department of Health publication ‘Safer Maternity Care’ the Secretary of State for Health aimed to achieve the national maternity safety ambition by pledging to reduce the rate of preterm birth from 8% to 6%. It was proposed that specialist preterm birth services should be established in the UK in order to achieve this aim. In response the Preterm Clinical Network has written Commissioning Guidance aimed to establish best practice pathways and agreed models of care to reduce variation nationally. They have been developed by clinical experts in the field, from within the UK, to provide recommendations for commissioning groups and to recommend pathways to organisations with the aim of reducing the incidence of preterm birth. Three key areas of care provision are focused on: prediction, prevention and preparation of women at high risk of PTB. This Expert Opinion, will summarise the Commissioning Guidance. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Endometriosis and gynecologic cancer show similar patterns of invasion. Little is known about the roles of autophagy in endometriosis and, to date, the expression of autophagy-associated mRNAs has not been compared in patients with endometriosis and gynecologic cancers. This study therefore compared the levels of expression of autophagy-associated mRNAs in patients with endometriosis and gynecologic cancers. The levels of autophagy mRNAs, including those encoding mTOR, P13KC3, Beclin-1, Bcl-2, LC3 II, FLIP, Rubicon, BIRC2 and BIRC5, were measured by real time polymerase chain reaction in peritoneal fluid of 27 patients with benign masses (control group), 42 patients with endometriosis, and 43 patients with gynecologic (ovarian, uterine, and cervical) cancers. Findings in the three groups were compared. Autophagy mRNAs were present in all samples from patients with endometriosis and gynecologic cancers. The levels of PI3K, FLIP, and Rubicon mRNAs were significantly higher in the endometriosis than in the control group (p < 0.05 each). Compared with the gynecologic cancer group, the levels of LC3II and FLIP mRNAs were significantly lower, and the levels of Beclin-1 and Rubicon mRNAs significantly higher, in the endometriosis group (p < 0.05 each). Levels of PI3K and FLIP mRNA were significantly higher in the endometriosis and gynecologic cancer groups than in the control group (p < 0.05 each). PI3K, FLIP, and Rubicon mRNAs are closely associated with the pathogenesis of endometriosis. The similar increases in PI3K and FLIP mRNA expression observed in patients with endometriosis and gynecologic cancer suggest that these conditions have similar autophagic characteristics. The lower levels of Beclin-1 mRNA in the gynecologic cancer than in other two groups suggest that lower Beclin-1 mRNA levels increase the likelihood of developing gynecologic cancer. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={There remains a need to differentiate between women with a benign or a malignant adnexal mass prior to surgery. As part of an ongoing evaluation of vaginal fluid compounds as potential tumor biomarkers we evaluated whether vaginal lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) predicted the subsequent diagnosis of a malignant adnexal mass. In this prospective pilot study vaginal fluid was obtained from 100 post-menopausal women referred for evaluation of a suspicious adnexal mass and tested for LPA by ELISA. Clinical data and serum CA125 results were obtained only after completion of all laboratory testing. Twenty eight of the women were subsequently diagnosed with an ovarian malignancy, four had a borderline tumor and 68 had a benign diagnosis. Among women with a malignant ovarian mass, 11 (39.3%) had an endometrioid adenocarcinoma +/− Clear cell tumor components, 6 (21.4%) had a high grade serous carcinoma, 3 (10.7%) had a mucinous tumor, 2 each (7.1%) had a malignant mixed mesodermal or a granulosa tumor and 1 each (3.6%) had a Clear cell tumor, a mixed cell tumor, leimyosarcoma or metastatic adrenal tumor. Compared to the median vaginal LPA level in women with benign lesions (1.5 μM), LPA was significantly elevated only in women with endometrioid ovarian cancer (7.9 μM) (p = 0.0137). Of the 6 endometrioid tumors in which values for both plasma CA125 and vaginal LPA were available 5 were positive only for LPA while one was only CA125 positive. Detection of LPA in vaginal secretions may be of value for the noninvasive diagnosis of endometrioid ovarian malignancies in post-menopausal women. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: Since 2005 the preferred method for surgical treatment of vaginal vault prolapse within the department has been laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy with an ultra-lightweight polypropylene mesh. The study aimed to explore the functional and anatomical outcomes and mesh adverse events of women following this procedure. Study design: All women who had a Laparoscopic Sacrocolpopexy (LSCP) using an ultra-lightweight (19 g/m 2 ) polypropylene mesh in two units in the North West of England between March 2005 and January 2013 (n = 238) were invited to participate in the study. Functional outcome data was collected using the Patient Global Impression Questionnaire (PGI-I), the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) and the Electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire (EPAQ) post-operatively. Anatomical outcome was assessed by Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System (POP-Q) measurement. A mesh palpability assessment was performed and any mesh complications were recorded using the International Continence Society/International Urogynecology Association (ICS/IUGA) classification system. The results were compared to those in our previously published series using the same surgical technique but a standard weight mesh (82.5 g/m 2 ). Results: 89% of participants reported that they felt their post-operative condition had improved. POP-Q results revealed that the median position of C changed from −3 pre-op to −7 post-operatively. Mesh was palpable during vaginal examination in only 3 women (3%). No mesh extrusion was identified during the study. Conclusions: The study demonstrates that LSCP performed with an ultra-lightweight polypropylene mesh improves women's functional and anatomical symptoms and appears to have a low risk of mesh extrusion. © 2019},

abstract={Objectives: To study the associations of preeclampsia with fetal death risk within percentiles of offspring birthweight, and whether these associations have changed during 1967–2014. Study design: In this population study, we included all singleton pregnancies in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway during 1967–2014 (n = 2 607 199). Odds ratios (ORs) for fetal death associated with preeclampsia were estimated within percentiles of birthweight by applying logistic regression analyses. We estimated ORs for the study period as a whole, and for the years 1967–1983 and 1984–2014. Results: During the study period as a whole, preeclampsia increased the risk of fetal death, OR 2.73 (95% CI 2.57–2.89), and the fetal death risk associated with preeclampsia differed across percentiles of offspring birthweight. The overall risk of fetal death decreased during our study period, and the decrease was most prominent in preeclamptic pregnancies with low offspring birthweight (<1 percentile). Thus, in recent years, the risk of fetal death in pregnancies with low offspring birthweight was lower in preeclamptic than in non-preeclamptic pregnancies, OR 0.22 (95% CI 0.12-0.41). Only in pregnancies with offspring birthweight within the 10–90 percentiles, the risk of fetal death associated with preeclampsia remained significantly increased throughout the study period. Conclusions: The decline in fetal death risk was most prominent in preeclamptic pregnancies with low offspring birthweight. The introduction of a national screening program for preeclampsia in the 1980s, and identification of growth restricted offspring by fetal ultrasonography, may explain our findings. © 2019},

abstract={Objective: To examine the association between station of the fetal head at complete cervical dilation and duration of second stage of labor, as well as prolonged second stage of labor, without and with the use of analgesia (EA). Study design: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study of 3311 women with a singleton pregnancy, gestational age ≥ 370 weeks, and cephalic presentation. Station of the fetal head at complete cervical dilation was categorized as at the pelvic floor, beneath the ischial spines, but above the pelvic floor, and at or above the ischial spines. In logistic regression analysis, we defined prolonged second stage of labor as &gt; 2 h without and &gt; 3 h with EA in nulliparous women, and &gt; 1 h and &gt; 2 h, respectively, in parous women. Results: Survival curves demonstrated longer durations of second stage of labor in nulliparous women and women with EA in each category of station of fetal head. The adjusted odds ratio of prolonged second stage of labor was 13.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.5-20.1) times higher when the fetal head was beneath the ischial spines, but above the pelvic floor, and 32.9 (95% CI: 21.5-50.2) times higher when the fetal head was at or above the ischial spines compared to at the pelvic floor. Conclusion: Station of the fetal head at complete cervical dilation was significantly associated with duration of second stage of labor. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={The role of episiotomy with regard to prevention of anal sphincter injuries (OASIS) is under discussion. The recently published guideline of the WHO “Intrapartum care for a positive childbirth experience” states that the role of episiotomy during operative vaginal deliveries remains to be established. This guideline is based on the evidence coming from randomised clinical trials. However, since the turn of the century large observational studies have pointed out that adequately performed mediolateral episiotomies may play an important role in the prevention of OASIS during operative vaginal deliveries. In this paper we present this evidence and plead for a broader vision on, and use of other evidence than randomised clinical trials solely, the preventive role of mediolateral episiotomy with regard to the occurrence of OASIS. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objective: To assess the results of the first trimester combined test to design a prenatal protocol for the introduction of the cell-free fetal DNA test as a contingent screening model. Method: An observational retrospective study in 12,327 singleton pregnancies to analyze the results of the combined first trimester screening, the nuchal translucency ≥97.5 percentile, their cytogenetic results and birth outcomes. Results: A total of 533 (4.3%) pregnant women had a risk in combined first trimester screening above 1/300. In this group, sixty nine had an unbalanced karyotype. The abnormal/normal karyotype ratio was 1/28 in pregnant women with intermediate risk (1/51-1/300) for trisomy 21 and trisomy 18, 1/58 with intermediate risk just for trisomy 21 and 1/37 with intermediate risk just for trisomy 18. A 19.8% of the unbalanced karyotypes had chromosomal abnormalities other than trisomies 21, 18 and 13. Two false negatives cases at first trimester combined screening presented a nuchal translucency ≥ p97.5 th . Conclusion: We propose the introduction of the cell-free fetal DNA test when the risk of first trimester combined screening is intermediate (1/51–1/300) and when nuchal translucency is ≥ p97.5 th with a low risk in the combined screening. This policy would allow us to continue to detect uncommon chromosomal abnormalities. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={Introduction: The fetal movement acceleration measurement (FMAM) recorder has made it possible to count gross fetal movements over many hours. Our purpose was to examine the relationship between umbilical cord length and fetal movements as counted by the FMAM recorder. Methods: Sixty-two pregnant women recorded fetal movements weekly from 28 weeks to term. The ratio of 10-s periods in which movement occurred to total time was calculated as a movement index. Umbilical cord length was measured at delivery. (1) Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted with six explanatory variables (primipara / multipara, anterior / posterior located placenta, placental weight, the mean movement index of 28–31, 32–35, and 36–39 week) and a response valuable (umbilical cord length). (2) All women were divided into groups of shorter, middle, and longer cord length, specifically less than 50 cm, between 50 and 60 cm, and more than 60 cm. The movement index was compared among the three groups at 28–31, 32–35, and 36–39 weeks. Results: A total of 2355.6 h from 368 night records were available. (1) There were no relationships between the cord length and the movement index of 28–31, 32–35, and 36–39 weeks (p = 0.090, 0.235, 0.129, respectively). (2) There were no differences in the movement index among the three groups at 28–31 and 32–35 gestational weeks (p = 0.096, and 0.465, respectively); however, the longer cord group had a greater movement index than the other two groups at 36–39 weeks (p = 0.0008). Discussion: This study suggested that fetal movement near term is an important factor in determining whether cord length becomes relatively longer in normal pregnancies. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: To evaluate the impact of trans-vaginal fractional CO 2 laser treatment on symptoms of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women. Study design: Women clinically diagnosed with SUI preferring non-surgical treatment were recruited to the study. Fractional CO 2 laser system (MonaLisa T, DEKA) treatments were administered trans-vaginally every 4–6 weeks for a total of three treatments. Response to treatment was assessed at baseline (T1), at 3 months after treatment completion (T2) and at 12–24-month follow-up (T3) using the Australian Pelvic Floor Questionnaire (APFQ). The primary outcome was changes in reported symptoms of SUI. Secondary outcomes assessed included bladder function, urgency, urge urinary incontinence (UUI), pad usage, impact of urinary incontinence on quality of life (QOL) and degree of bothersome bladder. Results: Fifty-eight women were recruited and received the study treatment protocol. Eighty-two percent of participants reported an improvement in symptoms of SUI at completion of treatment (mild to no SUI) (p = &lt;0.01). Treatment effect waned slightly when assessed at follow-up. Nevertheless, 71% of participants reported ongoing improvement in SUI symptoms at 12–24 months (p &lt; 0.01). All secondary outcome measures were improved after treatment compared to baseline. Conclusions: This study suggests that fractional CO 2 laser is a safe, feasible, and beneficial treatment for SUI and may have a role as a minimally-invasive alternative to surgical management. © 2019},

abstract={Objective(s): Obstetric Violence refers to professional deficiencies in maternity care. Examples include non-dignified care, discrimination and abandonment of care. Obstetric violence has been described in both low and high resource settings. The objective of this study was to assess knowledge and attitudes towards obstetric violence in a cohort of multinational obstetric nursing/midwifery staff and obstetricians at a private maternity hospital in Qatar. Study design: An online survey for anonymous completion was sent to the hospital email accounts of obstetric nursing/midwifery staff and obstetricians at Sidra Medicine (n = 640). The survey incorporated a video showing a dramatized scenario of obstetric violence. The survey assessed the participant's demographics and knowledge of the term obstetric violence. The participants scored their perceptions on the behaviors in the video using a visual analogue scale. The participants were then asked to reflect on their own practice. Comparisons of the survey responses were made between both doctors and nursing/midiwfery staff members using student's t-test. Results: 50 obstetricians and 167 obstetric nursing/midwifery staff fully completed the survey. Fifty two percent had previously heard of the term obstetric violence, and 48% could define it correctly. 136 (63%) had witnessed obstetric violence at some point in their career. Significant differences were seen when each professional group was asked to report on the behavior of the opposite professional team as depicted in the video (p = 0.01 and p < 0.001). Doctors completing the survey were also more critical of the doctors-in-training than were the midwifery/nursing staff (p = 0.06). Obstetricians and nursing/midiwfery responders identified patient dignity, privacy and patient-centred care as the leading professional deficiencies seen in the video. Obstetricians were significantly less likely to change their perceptions of how a care team should interact with a patient compared to the obstetric nursing/midwifery group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: This questionnaire study demonstrates that the majority of staff in this cohort were aware of obstetric violence and able to identify negative behaviours in the video and then reflect on how this impacts care they provide. Further studies are needed to identify ways in which obstetric violence can be prevented in both low resource and high resource settings. © 2019 The Authors},

abstract={Objectives: To determine the infectious aetiology of peripartum maternal pyrexia and to assess the diagnostic accuracy of obstetric systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and cardiotocography as predictors of peripartum infection, in order to guide appropriate antibiotic management of mother and neonate. Study Design: This study was carried out in a tertiary referral maternity hospital in Dublin, Ireland. A prospective cohort analysis was performed of 175 mother-newborn pairs with maternal pyrexia (≥38 °C) that developed after labour onset or within four hours postnatal. Infection was confirmed microbiologically in the case of sterile site infection, urinary tract infection (UTI) or growth of a significant perinatal pathogen from a placental swab. Infection was confirmed histologically by gross and microscopic examination of placentas in cases where there was growth of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms at a non-sterile site. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and cardiotocography in patients with confirmed infection versus those without evidence of infection were compared using independent samples t-test for continuous data and pearson chi-square test for nominal data. Diagnostic accuracy of obstetric systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria (elevated maternal heart rate, elevated respiratory rate, decreased systolic blood pressure and elevated white cell count) for the identification of infection among women with peripartum pyrexia was determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: The infection rate was 17.1% (30/175). The rate was 22% (22/100) for pyrexia that occurred during labour and 10.7% (8/75) if it occurred within four hours after delivery. Obstetric systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria and cardiotocography were not predictive of infection in women with peripartum pyrexia. No significant differences were observed in mean temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure or white cell count between those with infections and those with no evidence of infection. Conclusions: Peripartum pyrexia is predominantly of non-infectious origin. Improved diagnostic criteria are needed to identify infection for this indication.

abstract={Background: Female genital mutilation (FGM) is an assault on womanhood. Objective: To compare the obstetric outcome between parturient with genital mutilation with a cohort that has no genital mutilation. Materials and methods: This cross-sectional prospective study was done in the labour ward of Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki between 1st January 2013 and 31st December 2013. The obstetrics outcome of 260 consenting healthy parturients with FGM in the 1st stage of labour was compared with 260 cohorts with no FGM and also in labour. Data were obtained with a structured questionnaire and analysed using IBM SPSS Statistic version 20. Simple percentage odd ratio and Chi-square were used for data analysis at a p-value of < 0.05. Results: The mean age and gestational age of the women were 27.9 ± 4.8 years and 38.9 ± 1.5 weeks respectively. Majority of the women, 308 or 77.0%, belonged to social class 4 and 82.0% had Type 2 FGM. More than 90.0% of the women had a vaginal delivery and the 2nd stage of labour lasted more than 2 h in 13.4% of the women (OR = 0.78 95% CI 0.64-0.97). Parturient with FGM had increased odd of perineal tear (OR = 0.76 95% CI 0.63 - 0.91) and episiotomy (OR = 1.69 95% CI 1.17–2.45). The mode of delivery and neonatal Apgar scores were not significantly influenced by the presence of FGM (P > 0.05). Conclusion: The study has shown that FGM in labour increases the odds of developing perineal trauma which may be associated with a host of short- and long-term complications. We recommend continued awareness creation to stop FGM. © 2019},
