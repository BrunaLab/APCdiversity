abstract={Chaotic system has been widely used in the design of pseudorandom sequence generators. However, the performance of pseudorandom sequence generators is greatly affected by the chaotic degradation, which is caused by computational accuracy. In this paper, we propose a self-perturbed pseudorandom sequence generator based on hyper-chaotic system to overcome this problem. A novel hyper-chaotic system is constructed to achieve a complex dynamic behavior. One of the feedback controllers is used to disturb the other dimensions so that the short period can be avoided. Based on the proposed hyper-chaotic system, a pseudorandom number generator is designed. The dynamic behavior of the hyper-chaotic system is analyzed. The randomness and the security of the pseudorandom sequence generated by the proposed scheme are tested and analyzed. The results show that this scheme has a larger key space and a higher level of randomness. It is suitable to be used in privacy encryption and secure communication. © 2020 The Author(s)},

abstract={Bipartite graphs are often found to represent the connectivity between the components of many systems such as ecosystems. A bipartite graph is a set of n nodes that is decomposed into two disjoint subsets, having m and n−m vertices each, such that there are no adjacent vertices within the same set. The connectivity between both sets, which is the relevant quantity in terms of connections, can be quantified by a parameter α ∈ [0, 1] that equals the ratio of existent adjacent pairs over the total number of possible adjacent pairs. Here, we study the spectral and localization properties of such random bipartite graphs. Specifically, within a Random Matrix Theory (RMT) approach, we identify a scaling parameter ξ ≡ ξ(n, m, α) that fixes the localization properties of the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of random bipartite graphs. We also show that, when ξ < 1/10 (ξ > 10) the eigenvectors are localized (extended), whereas the localization–to–delocalization transition occurs in the interval 1/10 < ξ < 10. Finally, given the potential applications of our findings, we round off the study by demonstrating that for fixed ξ, the spectral properties of our graph model are also universal. © 2020 The Authors},

abstract={To evaluate the long-range cross-correlation in non-stationary bi-variate time-series, detrending-operation-based analysis methods such as the detrending moving-average cross-correlation analysis (DMCA), are widely used. However, its mathematical foundation has not been well established. In this paper, we propose a generalized theory to form the foundation of DMCA-type methods and introduce the higher-order DMCA in which Savitzky-Golay filters are employed as the detrending operator. Using this theory, we can understand the mathematical basis of DMCA-type methods. Our theory establishes a rigorous relationship between the DMCA-type analysis, the cross-correlation function analysis, and the cross-power spectral analysis. Based on the mathematical validity, we provide a practical guide for the use of higher-order DMCA. Additionally, we present illustrative results of a numerical and real-world analysis. To achieve reliable and accurate detection of the long-range cross-correlation, we emphasize the importance of time-lag estimation and time scale correction in DMCA, which has not been pointed out in the previous studies. © 2020 The Author(s)},

Since the actual data available from each individual is very limited, we use a dynamical system capable of synthesizing realistic songs, to generate surrogate-training data. The different synthetic songs are the result of integrating the dynamical system with slightly varied parameters. We show that a data set built in this way allows us to train the network to successfully identify the different individuals in our study.

abstract={Nowadays, with more and more people choosing energy-saving product, green supply chain is increasingly becoming popular. In this paper, we build a dynamic Stackelberg game model that contains government, two green innovation enterprise which is a leader and produces two kinds of green product with similar function but different quality and a retailer selling two kinds of green product meanwhile. We use classical backward induction to solve the model. Price decision is considered first and is divided into two stages. We analyze the equilibrium price of green innovation enterprise and retailer and the stable region. Next, we analyze energy-saving index of two kinds of green product. Through numerical simulation, we further analyze system's stability conditions and system's dynamic evolution process when different parameter is adopted. In the end, we consider green products’ baseline energy-saving index made by government and get the optimal baseline energy-saving index by numerical simulation. We find that too stringent subsidy standards may can't induce manufacturer to invest greener technology. Besides, we use the delay feedback control to effectively control the chaotic phenomenon. © 2019},

abstract={We explore simple models aimed at the study of social contagion, in which contagion proceeds through two stages. When coupled with demographic turnover, we show that two-stage contagion leads to nonlinear phenomena which are not present in the basic ‘classical’ models of mathematical epidemiology. These include: bistability, critical transitions, endogenous oscillations, and excitability, suggesting that contagion models with stages could account for some aspects of the complex dynamics encountered in social life. These phenomena, and the bifurcations involved, are studied by a combination of analytical and numerical means. © 2019},

abstract={In Network Science, node neighbourhoods, also called ego-centered networks, have attracted significant attention. In particular the clustering coefficient has been extensively used to measure their local cohesiveness. In this paper, we show how, given two nodes with the same clustering coefficient, the topology of their neighbourhoods can be significantly different, which demonstrates the need to go beyond this simple characterization. We perform a large scale statistical analysis of the topology of node neighbourhoods of real networks by first constructing their clique complexes, and then computing their Betti numbers. We are able to show significant differences between the topology of node neighbourhoods of real networks and the stochastic topology of null models of random simplicial complexes revealing local organisation principles of the node neighbourhoods. Moreover we observe that a large scale statistical analysis of the topological properties of node neighbourhoods is able to clearly discriminate between power-law networks, and planar road networks. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={We consider the brain as an autonomous stochastic system, whose fundamental frequencies are locked to an external periodic stimulation. Taking into account that phase synchronization between brain response and stimulating signal is affected by noise, we propose a novel method for experimental estimation of brain noise by analyzing neurophysiological activity during perception of flickering visual stimuli. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) we evaluate steady-state visual evoked fields (SSVEF) in the occipital cortex when subjects observe a square image with modulated brightness. Then, we calculate the probability distribution of the SSVEF phase fluctuations and compute its kurtosis. The higher kurtosis, the better the phase synchronization. Since kurtosis characterizes the distribution's sharpness, we associate inverse kurtosis with brain noise which broadens this distribution. We found that the majority of subjects exhibited leptokurtic kurtosis (K > 3) with tails approaching zero more slowly than Gaussian. The results of this work may be useful for the development of efficient and accurate brain-computer interfaces to be adapted to individual features of every subject in accordance with his/her brain noise. © 2019 The Author(s)},

abstract={We introduce a quantum superconducting metamaterial design constituted of flux qubits that operate as artificial atoms and analyze the dynamics of an injected electromagnetic pulse in the system. Qubit-photon interaction affects dramatically the nonlinear photon pulse propagation. We find analytically that the well known atomic phenomenon of self induced transparency may occur in this metamaterial as well and may lead to significant control over the optical pulse propagating properties. Specifically, the pulse may be slowed down substantially or even be stopped. These pulse properties depend crucially on the inhomogeneous broadening of the levels of the artificial atoms. © 2019},
